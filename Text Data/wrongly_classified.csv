great book huge fan of the harry potter series anyone that be this be a must own write like a play so it a different read just a head up definitely worth the money dont miss out on this book go get it ,1,0,201
it read a bit like fan fiction but for me that be mostly because the voice be off base on a story by jk rowling not write by jk rowling despite that bit of disappointment i be happy to read about the familiar character again ,1,0,225
it pretty obviously not totally write by jk rowling not really her style and the character do thing that be a bit out of character i would be interested in see the play it just fill a small part of the hole leave by the end of deathly hallows ,1,0,243
after read all the negative review it be actually not a bad book they use all the thing from jk rowling that be know to happen after the book 7 so it be nice to follow the history and hear more of what have happen no it be not a book from jk but it wasnt horrible either ,1,0,271
the story be okay it a jk rowling story so i have to give it prop but the character be awful the thing the character do even the way that they speak be dreadful i wish it would be write a a legit book by jk rowling not these other guy yes indeed it do read like fan fiction ,1,0,274
i like this book however if you be a huge fan of the 7 book like me you may be disappoint or upset actually it be not in the same style be a play instead of a novel it be much short and take too many turn from the storyline of the book it be not what i expect but i do like it ,1,0,277
so i actually read this when it first come out and really didnt like it it read a fan fiction to me but i just saw it on broadway and my god it be brilliant what be so ridiculous on the page be absolutely magical on the stage i take back all the bad thing i say about it before ,1,0,278
while this be an awesome book i do not intend to buy but seem amazon do not allow for ops i hit the wrong button so i have to cancel m kindle prime because i only have enough in my account for that shrug oh well their loss i be not fight to find a way to talk to them spend 30 min look i give ,1,0,293
im a huge harry potter fan ive read all the book multiple time a many other reviewer have i have low expectation for this book give that it be a script format i think it be brilliant for what it be it do lack character development but hey it not a novel so thats expect i hope they write a sequel ,1,0,297
i really hate give anything relate to harry potter less than 5 star so this pain me the story be very hard to follow along with be a playwright and it just didnt keep my interest like all of the other hp book do finish it however and will prolly reread it at some point i think it would be well write just a a novel and not the playwright ,1,0,339
love all the harry potter book but truly disappointed that my granddaughter copy will not get to her until aug 3 have preordered book before and receive them on the release date while i understand not get the copy until aug 1st because the release date be a sunday i expect to receive it on the 1st all of her friend have already read it and she have not even gotten hers yet ,1,0,376
meh a a long time potter fan who grow up with the book a they be publish i didnt hate this new stageplay script as much a a lot of other fan be hat on it it wasnt the most amazing thing ever and i felt like it lack that mystery element that make all of the book so engage but it be nice to return to the wizarding word in an official way even if it wasnt a dropdead fantastic a i be hop for ,1,0,391
most of the review here say the book be bad but i do not there be some wierd thing in the book like in the begining it skipps several year at a time also harry suck ron be plain wierd the darkness they see around albus be never explainded and the onlf cure be against anyone in the book be dracos wife but other than that i would say read it if you have spare time rwad it it be acuay not bad ,1,0,393
i be skeptical when it be reveal that this story would be release a a play script and not a novel but this story go beyond my expectation overall it be a great story where harry potter be just a secondary character the only disappointment i have be the villain in the story because i felt she should have be a lot strong than what she be i be also disappointed to see jk rowling say she be do with harry potter ,1,0,411
i do not follow or read fan fiction so i do not know how this compare i understand that this read like fan fiction for me i be very happy to be reinserted into that wonderful world again after so many year so i be able to look past the poor dialogue and somewhat predictable character development if you have a high standard of fan fiction then you may not be impress i look forward to watch the stage version because that be guarantee to be even well ,1,0,452
alright i just finish this a halfhour ago i really dont have any complaint maybe im too tire after buy this book at midnight to give clear judgement but im gon na try anyway nothing really majorly mad if youre a potter fan youwill enjoy this i like how the character have progress and i like how none of them be perfect they all have flaw and a major part of this be that harry have flaw i really enjoy this only complaint be that it be in script form i understand it perfectly i just miss read harrysor in this case probably albuss thought ,1,0,541
i love the harry potter universe and iwill read pretty much anything the jk put her stamp on but if you be read this review i doubt you be like them then1 it a script for a play it cearly not even the work script because there be no stage direction a all just a blip here and there about where they be it all dialog2 the plot be write like a 90 reunion episode for your favorite 80 sitcom family they go out of their way to have people that shouldnt be in the hp universe 20 year in future pop in for a cameo the dialog be much good than what you find in those tv events3 40 year old be kind of lame and have flawsread it if you love harry potter dont read it if you be a casual fan ,1,0,683
something you have to remember before read this be that this be mean for a play and not write by jk she have control over it work with the playwright to make sure it stay true to the harry potter world a it be write for a play of course it not go to be extremely detail it a play im not a fan of read script so that be difficult to get past for me but you get use to it as far a the storyline it a bit of a stretch but if jk approve of it then i accept it it felt like closure for a series i have love since i be a child a closure i didnt know i need and some people have say that it felt like fanfiction well it be it just original authorapproved fanfiction all in all i think it a pretty good book ,1,0,700
this be not a harry potter book please dont try to make it one before read this i know it wast write only by jk rowling and that it be mean to be see a a play and everyone else should remember that too it doesnt feel the same a a harry potter book and the character dont always feel like the same one but these character have age 20ish year and these word be mean to be bring to life on stage and not read on a page it be a good story but it have the limitation of a stage production you cant expect it to have the same depth and plot a a book might while i havent see the live production i can tell you this be an amazing play but it be a mediocre book if you remember that it isnt a book you will love it ,1,0,707
first off this be write a a play with the majority of the write come from jack thorne not jk rowling however the writing style be very in sync with her other book this jump around a lot more than a traditional novel with much short chapter if you will because it be design to be act out on a stage in front of a live audience come in at just over 300 page it be a quick and easy read the story line be actually not bad at all though some seem to be throw fit about it it take a little get use to read this a a play but it didnt bother me much at alli recommend give this book a try it actually well write with a viable story line and interesting plot twist sorry for be vague and non informative in general i dont want to deal with spoiler ,1,0,740
im not sure what people be expect be you expect the 8th enstallment to the harry potter series be you think this would be write like a novel by jk rowling chronicle the future of the wizarding worldthe title of the book itself clearly state none of these thing it be upfront in that it be base on an original story by rowling but be not write by her it say it be part 1 2 of a screenplay yes a play call the cursed child mean it be not a part of the first 7 harry potter book and it be also write a a screenplay not the usual novel form past hp book be write inno the character do not have the magic or come to life like in other book write by rowling because she do not write thisfor what the book be it isnt bad it give fan a look into the world of magic after harry potter life at hogwarts if you be a die hard fan keep in mind this be not the 8th book rowling do not write it and do not expect it to follow her way of write ,1,0,928
i almost didnt read thing because the review be so harsh but the plot on wiki sound like something i want to happen since book one this epic story come in the form of a play manuscript and leave much up to the imagination if you be strong with your own hp imagery then this will be a pleasure to read it will take a couple of chapter to get use to the format no doubt but press on just when you think you have it figure out there be a plot twist i have not see comingas a writer i become skeptical when author dont push plot to their full interest this story reveals layer by layer a question i have be ask for eon what would happen if potter get sort into slytherin but then it go a step far than you can imagine this be all i can say without reveal spoiler about this spellbind book the whole cast and crew be present to assist with an epic tale prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime and please dont knock it till youve try it ,1,0,935
spoilersaim not just say that a a fanboy because jkr didnt even write this booki love it because it perfectly reflect my own life of try to make my parent proud then when that doesnt work just a with albus i would work hard at try to fix broken thing to only make them bad to try again and make them go even more bad to the point that life become like black horrify pit of hell this be what happen to albus and be exactly how my own life play out and just when you think the horribleness be over it only get hard but through these trial we become strong and wise and we learn that be skilled at something have lot of money or romantic love none of that really matter it nice sure but none of it matter the thing that we must set our focus on far exceedingly more than those trivial thing be friendship that be where true strength lie with friendship nothing be out of reach everything be achievable if we place friendship a priority onejayallan bennett ,1,0,953
80 like 20 dislike not hateokay first thing first so a lot of people have express their feeling of hate for this book let get this straight people i do not hate this book the only reason this book get 4 star be because the character be not themselves but iwill get to that later first i speak directly to those who havent read it yet ignore the bad review they be say what they think you might like it so go on buy the book and give it a try second my opinion the book be fg awesome the plot be interesting and a lot of people dont agree but spoiler alert i kinda like the time turner and a time turner that only go back 5 minute at a time yessnow for the bad part a a lot of people have already say j k rowling do not write this book i completely agree again the character be not themselves since when have harry be this grumpy and why have they turn ron into a fred substitute how can draco suddenly talk to hermione with respect thats all i have to say ,1,0,956
the gift receiver be absolutely enamor by the box so much so she willingly stop protect her husband from me a little backstory i be friend with her husband first and throughout the year of know him he have sell me inch by inch more piece of his sphincter and color start from his anus these be transaction that usually include me feed him delicious home cook meal or treat him to a man date i be a straight man but weve play this game where we try to catch each other off guard and do thing like cop a feel grab butt or even do kancho see definition below after he meet his wife shes try to be his shield why i be tell this story after gift his wife this a a christmas present she say to him that she can not protect him any more because i give her the best present everlong story short this can make wife stop protect their husband from be molest or violatedkancho be a game or trick often play in japan by young schoolaged child it be perform by clasp the hand together so the index finger be point out and attempt to insert them into someone anal region when the victim be not look ,1,0,1085
i go into this book expect not to like it too well because of the review but a a harry potter fan i know that i would have to read it eventually the play format be hard to get use to at first but after a while i start to get into the groove of it however the story line start off slow and be kind of depress the main focus be on albus potter who seem to be the complete opposite of his father and resents live in his shadow he seem to be very lonely and depress in his life and the only positive thing be his best friend scorpius malfoy about 14 way through the book start to get well when the boy decide to help out amos diggory who want to use a time turner to bring back his son albus and scorpius make several attempt travel back in time try to change the past but all their attempt create terrible butterfly effect on the present i do enjoy read about snape very briefly in one of the alternate reality travel to since snape be my favorite character but like other people have point out all the time travel stuff do kind of read like fanfiction the book be ok but i be sad that the main character of the harry potter series just seem to have just get old and boring ,1,0,1171
spoiler ahead pretend this be a fan fiction and you wont be disappointedi loved learn about album scorpius draco the relationship between harry and others and the touching sentiment before imminent death i adore those aspect for that alone i enjoy this scriptthe reason i say pretend it afan fiction be because im sorry jk rowlings but you write such a tight series to start with that people know your character as well a you voldemort quite simply would not have a child he wouldnt he didnt love and obviously sex can occur without love but he didnt want an equal there be no way hed have risk a child throughout his entire life need to be the only special one the only heir of slytherin he kill his father for cry out loud family mean nothing to him power for himself alone and self sufficiency be all he care about he be not get freaky with bellatrix noope hed have create another horcrux first then there be the issue of time turner say one do survive it sort of a lame way out this isnt back to the future and no one want it to be id have prefer this to be some sort of what if dreamspell than actual time travel i get that im an adult read about a faux magical world but i guess time trave of this magnitude be just a bit much for me thats why it feel fan fictionbut again go back to the character be awesome ron always my favorite remain my favorite draco be perfect great to hear their voice again take it with a grain of salt and enjoy hang out with the character we grow up with ,1,0,1489
first off i do not regret buy this book whatsoever it be a play whos story be base off jk rowling and have input from her but she didnt write it know this before you read it be very important because i go in not expect the level of development and creativity that rowling have in her book and that allow me to enjoy the book much more because i wasnt pick out the detail that be wrong that be the end of my spoiler free reviewok so like many book there be thing i love and hat about iti lovedmost of the plotpages 053 be amazingscorpius malfoy be the most amazing jscbjrjslkhhthe look inside the past and different charactersthe endingvoldemorts secret love childslytherinsanything dark that happen in the script because it be very intriguingharry and ginnys relationshiprose granger weasleyharry a head of magical law enforementshermione as ministerastoria a a characterdracos ponytaili hateddislikedthe abrupt character change with albusdraco and harry become friend since they be duel early and it seem forceddelphi just in general her plan didnt make sensethat cedric could become a death eater just because he be humiliate at 17 like no he be a hufflepufftoo much time travelthe trolley witch doesnt makeany sensethat weird i love you scene with dumbledores portraitvoldemort daythe diggeroys be too important in this playi could write more but i think this be good enough if you be a harry potter fan this a must read just dont go into it think it will be the same a rowlings write also sorry if there be a lot of typo i wdoge this on a kindle paperwhite ,1,0,1561
i feel i must start this review by say that i be a die hard harry potter fan i have all the book on audio and listen to them on repeat on a daily basis they be my background noise or white noise i can quote whole section at a time with jim dale a he read it i eagerly suck up any additional story or writing i can from jk about the wizarding world and for that reason alone i love the play with that be say i be disappoint by the obvious lack of jks skill in this play it be obvious that it be write by someone else and only approve by her there be a lack of detail in the storyline and more flat out bash you over the head with information the story also seem rush a compare to the book this might be because it be mean to be enjoy a a play and not a a book but i find it to be a little disappointing from this point on i warn you of spoilersspoiler alertspoiler alertspoiler alertthe story pick up at platform 9 34 19 year later already i be annoy that some line be speak by the wrong character but maybe i be the only one that pick up on that albus become best friend with scorpius scorpius and albus become best friend albus and scorpius be attach at the hip inseparable friend we get it they bash you over the head with it unlike jk who let you discover character development through character behavior these guy flat out tell you over and over and over again i find it a little insulting but maybe it come across different in the play i hat the lady that push the trolley they change her from a human witch into some strange bogart like morph monster it seem out of line for the wizarding world and rather uninventive i find it more likely that there be a spell or barrier that keep the student on the train and not a monster cart lady that be as old a timei do like hearing about where harry ron and hermione be now i find it perfectly natural that ron be a huge jokester now we all know that he take over freds spot in the joke shop and with his wife be in a serious position like the minister of magic it make sense that he would balance out the relationship by be over the top funny i also like the way they portray ginny and harrys relationship ginny always do seem more insightful than harry so when he fly off the handle at albus it seem natural that she would comfort him and be able to reassure him that al will forgive himi always think there be something between bellatrix and the dark lord so to hear they have a daughter seem entirely natural there be easily enough time between when we see them at the beginning of book 7 july so probably already pregnant but not show and when the snatcher bring harry to the malfoys for her to have have a babyover all i be glad to have further information on where everyone be now but i be disappoint in many part of the plot the way it be write and the lack of jks input this wont be something i listen to on repeat but i will likely still read it once a year ,1,0,2917
when the harry potter series end i know that it wouldnt really be over not permanently for one thing there be too big and devote a fanbase for another too much money to be madeand i be right with the 2016 release of a new movie set in the same universe and harry potter and the cursed child a stage play that also serve a a sequel to the original series while it lack the narrative ebb and flow of the book three year pass in a few page it a solid enough sequel that expand the story into the next generation there dark overtone plenty of new character and more magical shenanigansthe story begin where the last book end with harry potter ron weasley and hermione granger send their child off to hogwarts but albus potter quickly find that he regard a a disappointment by everyone there not be he pretty bad at magic but he quickly become best friend with young scorpius malfoy and be sort into slytherin a the year go by both scorpius and albus be trouble albus by the weight of his father legacy and scorpius by malicious rumor that he actually the secret son of voldemortmeanwhile harry and hermione discover that a new superior type of timeturner be be create and harry begin have strange dream that hint that something horrible be come after the two boy use a timeturner to try to right an old wrong they find that theyve mess up the timeline and a they try to fix the mistake they make they soon find themselves in the grip of a terrible enemylike most timetravelcentric story harry potter and the cursed child become a little braintwisty at time but the core of it be essentially about two relationship one be between the unlikely best friend scorpius and albus two boy who seem like opposite until you realize that both be burden by the legacy of a fatherrumored father and the other be about harry and albus a father and son who love each other but cant communicate well and the clash between albus moody loneliness and harrys overprotectivenessadmittedly the concept feel rather like a fanfic at time especially the big reveal about a certain character true identity no im not go to mention who it be but it eyerollingly fanficcy however it a fairly wellwritten one with some quirky dialogue i dont remember the last time someone ask my name what be your name ive forgotten and new character who fit fairly well into the narrative there be also some chill glimpse of a hogwartsthatmighthavebeen after twenty year of ruthless rule by voldemort and his followersand of course fan will see a lot of familiar face not just harry hermione ron and draco but a number of less character in the past or alternate present such a snape or umbridge and it do an excellent job flesh out some of these character such a an old griefstricken draco malfoy who ironically have more insight into albus than harry do the scene where he and harry discuss their family and experience be one of the best of the playprobably it big problem be a few conversation that dont add much to the actual story or character but arent wellwritten enough to be entertain on their own ginny and harry discuss albus and his issue which be quite cliched it feel like it need another rewrite or two in place or a scene or two whittled downharry potter and the cursed child have a somewhat fanficcy flavor but be a fairly clever story with some solid dialogue and two strong characterdriven subplots i doubt iwill be watch it onstage but the story itself be certainly worth check out for fan of this universe ,1,0,3478
this review be 98 spoilerfreei finish read this snappy read about an hour ago i havent really read any review of it other than some of taglines like so many twist there be no more twist to this story than any other potter story perhaps the cruel twist then be in expect reader who have never read a play to hope it reach them as emotionally a the first seven story didwithout the narrative and inner voice to accompany what be little more than dialogue and stage direction the author be force into weave slight contrivance into the dialogue to help shepherd the reader into understand the motivation behind any give character in any give scene in the end it work but i wonder how many reader get that far without become frustratedthe story center around albus severus potter remember reading that name in deathly hallows and almost be move to tear at the significance behind it it seem that albus isnt all that interested in what make mom and dad name him that in fact his priority appear to be in come to grip with be the son of harry potter another of the main character be a kid name scorpius malfoy who also seem to be have issue live up to his own father best wish through a series of encounter and early on in the story we learn that albus and scorpius who somehow have find themselves to be kindred spirit be contrive to step back into the past with a time turner to right a wrong and make the world a good place it wouldnt be much of a story if they succeed in do just that so theres all sort of misunderstood action and misstep along the way you dont have to read too many book on time travel to know that sometimes thing can really go wrong with the slightest of action a temporal butterfly effectin true rowling fashion thing get off to a bang and theres loss of life at stake on a massive scale depend on whether or not the potter and malfoy progeny can undo whats be do of course they cant not on their own and even then there be some minor complaint about the writing at time it seem a though this be a story wrap up in a trivial pursuit game many name from the past be reintroduce a can be expect in any series that have run this long but often we be meet with obscure name that may have be mention once in an early chapter of an even early story in the set and thats the only mention be the author offer a nod to the true potter geek i didnt consider these moment a roadblock but they be certainly distract and seem to be shoehorn into the text in a unwieldy a manner a could be expectedthe story be very good everything a true potter fan could have hop for among the bestwritten part in the play be the redemption and acknowledgment of past courageous act for a number of wellknown character this seem to also be a nod to true devotee who may have felt certain character sacrifice both know and assume go unappreciated for too long i dont want to spoil anything so iwill leave that up to your imagination a to whom im write about regardless these passage could have be write in a ridiculously syrupy manner and perhaps if this be a traditional novel that would have be the case but the stage be too swollen with action for character or audience to dwell too much on them the author be to paraphrase one exchange planting acorn for the ride home and for the week to comeone thing that stand out to the even mildly observant reader be that try to stage this play a write would be a courageous endeavour there be seemingly hundred of scene scatter through the act and the magic be deeply ingrain throughout how certain action could be translate to the stage be beyond me but thats happily not my job it do make me want to see the play in person howeverwhat would be even more interesting would be to see how it could be bring to the cinema screen it would be interesting to see it happen but it would have to occur with at least one major change in the cast alan rickmans pass would demand someone that could handle snapes line not much of a spoiler since it already be reveal that the play involve a good deal of time travelso anyway a good read almost a mustread for the true potter fan with a gentle warning to approach with caution remember it not a novel there be a good deal of read between the line require in order to follow along without get too frustrate ,1,0,4279

i love harry potter so much it be my whole world but i really didnt like this book it be a play script so im assume the play be well and i shouldnt judge of the book but still ,0,1,176
love the book itself but not the story it be soo different from harry potter and the fact that the character didnt even have the personality we have all grow to love over the year ,0,1,180
even though it a play and therefore one doesnt expect the same plot development a a novel it have none of the dynamic of rowlings novel would have to see it stag to well evaluate it ,0,1,182
i didnt expect this to be in play form which doesnt read a easily for the average reader i think also i felt there be too much repetition from previous book and not much new content ,0,1,182
like many on here i purchase this more or less blind on kindle expect something write by rowling this be sub standard a literature although the play itself may well be excellent in performance ,0,1,193
i be a 68 yr old grandmother and i read harry potter with the kidsthis book stinksdont waster your money if you have to read it get it from the library so you can use your money for a good book ,0,1,194
i can only echo what many other reviewer have say here and so i wont belabor the point but i do wish now that i hadnt read this book because it have taint the original for me possibly irrevocably ,0,1,196
not as good a previous novel by a long shot even give that this be a script it an easy read and fun to see beloved character grow up but the story be flat and uninspired compare to what be expect ,0,1,196
the script format leave out a lot of description and feeling that a novel would reveal the character do not speak in a manner consistent with their style in the novel story hard to follow disappointing ,0,1,202
the story line be good but jk rowlings know how to tell a great story this one because of it be write a a broadway play do not deliverwe would have enjoy it more a a novel rather than a script for a play ,0,1,204
disappoint i have love the harry potter series for a very long time however this do not live up to the excitement of another chapter to the harry potter series if it be write like a novel it might of be well ,0,1,208
hp use to rock what happend this book have no meaning at all also it really annoy bc it in script whats the point so anyway if you have not read it yet then consider yourself lucky and definitely do not read it ,0,1,211
a pitiful excuse for a harry potter book the rest of the review here can give you more detailed account of this screenplaybook hybrid but if you want something concise to discourage you from buy this book this be it ,0,1,216
it like you could tell which part jk rowling do and which part she didnt a lot of it be stilted in a way that isnt the rowling style i enjoy still the overall plot and plot style werent bad although transparent at time ,0,1,219
i download the free sample to see if i would like this series as much a i do the potter series my sample include the title page the acknowledgement page and the list of those individual involve do i want to buy it how would i know ,0,1,231
this book be write in a script format which make it very difficult to read not a fan of this style i be really hop for a more normal version of this story oh well if you dont mind the script style you will probably enjoy this book ,0,1,231
i know that it be a play or thats what the book be make for but it not great to read it that way so i wish i have come more in a book style then have to read each character partor that we be give a choice a to how to read the book ,0,1,231
i definitely find it interest to visit a possible future for the golden trio other hogwarts alum but this be not part of the story i love so much im dismay to see that amazon include it in their series of 8 hp e book available for kindle ,0,1,238
a horrible excuse for a book in the harry potter universe if youre one of the few people who actually like the epilogue at the end of the deathly hallow then this book might speak to you but if you hat the epilogue youre go to hate this book even more ,0,1,252
my daughter who be 28 and teach high school english want this book to add to her harry potter collection so i order it for her for christmas we end up borrow the book from a friend and she hat it now im not sure if she still want the book for christmas ,0,1,253
disappoint it be a if rowling forgot who harry be he say thing that be out of character ron be portray a less intelligent than he be for me the most likable thing about the story be the friendship between the boy and the evolution of harry and draco relationship ,0,1,263
the only thing worthwhile in this script be the relationship between albus and scorpius but make sure to stop reading before the end before the author get scar off from depict real love between two young men and throw scorpius to the harsh and judgemental rise weasley ,0,1,269
sloppy and thrown together with very little thought or building of the new character i miss the image that the other story paint with great detail effort and imagination this book lack all of that i honestly wish id never read it and stop after the last book of the original series ,0,1,282
this play get a one review for nostalgia it be confusedly write a a mash of fiction stage play and movie script the story be pleasant at time but if you follow it too closely youwill see there isnt all that much there whats unforgivable be any marketing be this book a canon it be not ,0,1,285
i love harry potter everythingbooks movie memorabilia the universal studio wizarding world the cursed child just didnt work for me it seem kind of flat and the character werent as likeable a the first seven book i still flip through my copy but this be a disappointing read for any potterhead ,0,1,293
i personally could never get into the story while try to read a play formatmost people probably love it but i didnt make it very far before put it downthe other potter book be all consuming and i hat to put them down for basic necessity such a prepare meal and eat disappoint would describe my opinion ,0,1,302
harry be do now roll tweet the other day yeah where have we hear that one before do until the next cash grab come along maybe the publisher will milk this dead cow until she dry up then look for the inevitable reboot or spinoff it star war all over again harry potter have become the mcdonalds of fantasy ,0,1,305
i really do not like this play it do not flow the story line be good but fail to develop the character it just seem to fee off of the potter phenomenon and not really develop it far if you be a complete potter fan i suppose i could recommend it but not if you be a purist with your own delightful imagination ,0,1,309
i love harry potter everything about harry potter i read fan fic and it be mostly good this be just bad fan fic i doubt rowling have much input maybe the play be well since there be much more to fill the sens that way but the character interaction be cringe worthy i keep hop it would get good and it never do ,0,1,310
meh not up to ms rowlings usual exacting standard for write the plot be lackluster predictable and thoroughly unengaging i find myself root against the protagonist who be nothing but a spoiled brat your time would be good spent read one of the original harry potter novel which be decidedly more well original ,0,1,310
i want to love it i want to like it but every time i pick it up it just a bit weirdwith out spoil it for you this be a script not a book a script so if you like read script with your buddy and you have a thing for the potter boy this will be your booki wont be go to see the play when it come to town and this book wont get reread ,0,1,331
you could tell as soon a you start read that these be not jk rowlings character it be hard to get into the harry potter mind set when the character didnt act like themselves the dialogue be bore i think it be probably well a a play since i love harry potter it be fun to read more about him but honestly i wont be reread it like my other hp book ,0,1,346
i hat the script a oppose to a write novel the character be insufficiently flesh outand the plot fail to develop into anything remotely interest what should have be a very interesting look at harry potter life a an adult and the adventure of his child turn into a juvenile attempt next time jk rowling should leave it to her fan to write the next novel what a shame ,0,1,366
be so hop this would be a omg i love it harry potter book i purchase the hardback book and feel it would have be even more difficult to read in kindle format not impressed with read the play format and i felt it be just a back story to get people interested in the harry potter franchise again disappointed but a it be the only way to catch up on potter i slog through it ,0,1,372
ive read on the internet that this work much good a a play than a a book apparently the special effect in the play be 90 of the fun i hope this be true since the story itself be tire and cliched youve probably read it before only now you can slap the harry potter name onto it i prefer to think of this a an alternate universe story since it hard for me to reconcile the original series with this ,0,1,397
i think that it wrong that amazoncom be call this book 8 of 8 in the harry potter series it not a book in the sense that the seven novel in the series be it a transcript of the play even more importantly it be not write by jk rowling she be credit with be one of three people who create the new original story but to the best of my knowledge she do not actually write one word of the play caveat emptor people ,0,1,410
dear readeri love harry potter i love hogwarts i love the book the movie the theme park all of itthis however be junk story be lame dialogue be corny and the whole thing feel well fundamentally contrivedim glad jk rowling be rich she deserve it but this junk be a marketing stunt go wrong sure some hardcore fan be go to love it but deep down they know the truth this be a cash cow nothing more nothing lesswish i could get the time back with a wave of my wand ha ,0,1,464
this book be a fun read to hold on to harry potteri be extremely excited to see how the future of their life and their kid life turn outslytherin concept be perfectplot be rush through and too jumpy due to play conceptactual cast for the play terrible if you enjoy the movie have set look and personality that define them in the movie change will throw you offworth the money just dont get to excitedit should be rewrite in a book format not play to fill in the missing space ,0,1,476
i read harry potter to my kid and we all fell in love with the book this be fun but a very light and disappointing read it really only fully engage me emotionally a handful of time which be in stark contrast to the series it be write a a play script my 14 your old daughter read this in one day and i read it in about 6 hour harry potter fan will want to read it but dont expect much and it might be worthwhile to wait and borrow it from a friend they will finish the book quickly ,0,1,481
not a novel miss all the color scenery background that go into novel just text and some action by the actor quizzical look another and book like james patterson and or tom clancy and write by an author tire of writing who have a publisher that need another book maybe if it be a graphic novel i hope the play fill it out sufficiently but expectation be low for a play than a novel one expect some thing to be symbolically represent or skip by because quidditch sp just cant be truly be reproduce in a theater or even a stadium but a novel novel can hold whole universe this be just a script ,0,1,591
a very unoriginal plot accompany by a desperate attempt to invoke nostalgia in reader and attempt to offer them some insight in a broad story of the potter family to me it felt like the tvshow lose set in a world of fantasy mistery after mistery bring the story to a point where a reader will think how the hell be they go to solve this whole connundrum and in the end offer a very desperate conclusion to the whole adventure try to convey some great message in relation to family relationship not to mention the fantastical amount of plot holesi like snapes part in the story though be neat ,0,1,592
i find the dialogue simple and the relationship archaicjk rowling achieve with book 17 what only a handful of author have she make nonreader and reader both young and old male and female discover a passion for reading and to actually anticipate a book to be release for me harry be never daniel radcliffe or whoever be play him on stage but he be her word and my imagination first and formost a with most people who read the book first by release it in this form and without stay true to the character and part that even counteract the previous book it take for me the escape and true magic away ,0,1,596
the familiar story format be not use i can read play format but they do not allow my reading style to skim then feast on good scenesi be also very disappointed that harry son the protagonist be so down on himself these young people be real and all around u however i keep want him to have more good day than bad this child do not have the attitude harry have that each day he wake would be one of adventure learning and deal with the issue of the story plotthe plot be slow very like a two film where the story be not new but a rerun with new clothes an additional new character or so and new scenery ,0,1,601
i wasnt able to read it but i suspect that be because the character interaction or more specifically the affinity jk rowling writes with be miss and while i be sure the author intend well that be a huge reason her potter book be so successful the tremendous joy humor and love we all hold for harry ron hermione and eventually most of the hogwarts student and professor however in all fairness to the author of this work i put it down too quickly and perhaps it would have improve have i continue read it so this review may not help because the bottom line be make up your own mind and do not let me discourage you ,0,1,615
spoiler you can tell it be not write by jk rowling harry be a very different father than the one we saw send his son off to hogwarts in this version he be uncomfortable in the role of father and have a hard time relate to his son a sweet little old witch be turn into a demon truant officer and there be a very unlikely offspring a the new villain i look forward to read this and really try to like it but could not there be so much time travel and alternate universe that i think i must be read a dr who scifi rather than a rowling hogwarts fantasy the one redeem part be the pairing of best friend from the offspring of enemy ,0,1,628
ugh theres the root of a good story here too bad it be handle in such an inconsistent manner flash of brilliance depth of well notthis be title a a rehearsal script im interested to see how much of it survive the workshop and preview and make it into the final production include all of the wild staging challenge and multitudinous scene change this read like a screen play incompetently pose a a stage play and the characterization of the now adult character not a challenge id want to face be disappoint to say the leastbottom line this could have be a terrific novel then movie if write by jkr i can only hope they be able to fix the stage play now iwill look for review of that ,0,1,682
the story start out well i like the new character and the setup the first third of thes cript be entertain and feel almost but not quite like harry potter classic there be a few fun detail and backstory and it just feels good to be backunfortunately the rest of the script be quite disappointing the character be superficial and always act exactly a you expect the plot be ridicilous implausible and yet without any surprise whatsoever the dialogue read like a speech by donald trump it tell you in black and white what the world be like and how you should feel about it there be no nuance no room for interpretationi end up skip page to make it end sooner i be leave with one question why do rowling allow this ,0,1,712
the beginning of the end of what be once a perfect seriesthis book would be fine if it be a noncannon silly little childrens play but this be certify by rowling herself so it an abominationthe character be all inconsistent with what have be establish the plot be a excuse to have harry potter and the great hit collection on stage the twist be bland uninspired and illogical the book make a major mistake by bring back the timeturner something jk herself have say be a problem because of the plot hole it create well now we have a book consisting of nothing but plot holeslike i say if your kid want to see the play fine they will enjoy it however a a diehard adult hp fan it break my heart to see such a cheap product pas itself off a harry potter ,0,1,749
i just finish reading this book and i be so disappointed the character didnt feel like those i grow so fond ofspoiler alertthings that really bother me draco seem to have all of a sudden turn into some nice guy who like work with harry and hermione to make sure voldemort doesnt get back in power how many time do scorpius and albus need to hug at first i think it be a build up to them fall in love but it wasnt they both conveniently have crush on different girl the dialogue for ron weasley be downright annoy it like he regress into be a preadolescent boy rather than mature into an adult could scorpius be any nicer there be no complexity to his character at allit would have be nice to have see professor lupins son in the play i do enjoy get to see snape again but it seem contrive that character from the past get to tell what they be feel to the present day charactersi wish i never read this i would have like to keep the end of book 7 a the true end in my head ,0,1,972
grow up i love the harry potter book seriously from age 1221 i couldnt get enough i read every book over and over again on a loop so i be hesitant to read the cursed child the problem with most sequel be that they can tarnish the original and wouldnt that be awful while i dont think the cursed child ruin the original series it do stain some of the very best part of goblet of fire dead character be bring back to life briefly i really want to like this book and do the best i could to see through the screenplay style but the plot fall short our favorite character be reduce to onedimensional version of themselves the only way i get through this book be the pretend it be just bad fan fiction the one redeeming quality of the book be the end the whole first 90 have me shake my head and genuinely dislike our protagonist albus potter be kind of a jerk i easily could have do without read the book and imagine the whole story will eventually fade in my memory while the original story will be as love a the first time i finish the first book and every book after ,0,1,1065
i understand what this book be go to be before i take the leap page after page i read know it have to stand on it own merit and not in the shadow of the first 7 book that my friend be exactly where it fell short the story from start to finish the character and ultimate outcome be so incredibly lackluster and inconsequential that it break my heart remove harrys name from the cover and what you have leave be a bland uninteresting story and character that you have to struggle to connect with i wish i could give the book four thumb down but unfortunately i only have two so that will have to sufficealthough harry potter isnt the main character in this book and it hardly matter the story and character feel lifeless and the finished product feel more like a rough draft that wasnt fully flesh outit be always difficult be harry potter and it isnt much easy now that he be an overworked employee of the ministry of magic a husband and father of three schoolage childrenand lastly the formula that work so well in the original book be nowhere to be find the universal appeal of harry potter be that adult can remember be child and want to have magical power and go on adventure and most present day child want to have magical power and go on adventure who in their right mind young or old want to grow up to be an overworked employee that have no time to spend with their family jk rowling and her cohort have clearly be get their idea from the george lucas school of how to destroy your own legend sorry for the rant very disappointed in what could have be an amazing story ,0,1,1576
since the advent of kindle ive rarely buy paper book any more digital book be easy to store and a lot of time theyre cheap toowhen harry potter and the cursed child come out i thought about get a hard copy i love the harry potter series and what good way to celebrate the new story than to buy a book that i can display on my shelf but old habit die hard and i get the ebook insteadhalfway through the cursed child i become terrified that rowling would release a new edition of the deathly hallows my favorite in the series and one of my alltime favorite book ever be a star war fan as well a a harry potter fan im well aware of the tendency to change the old more beloved story to fit the new stuff instead of take care to make sure the new stuff doesnt contradict the real storyand i dont want my deathly hallows change thank you very much it harry and not ginny who tell albus that he like a laugh your brother i know kindle periodically send out update to book and what if one day i accidentally hit a button and my deathly hallows get update what if harry isnt a good father in my epilogue anymorehaving work myself up into a complete panic i hurry to amazon and buy myself a paper copy of harry potter and the deathly hallows there now the story will always end like it suppose to harry a great dad and his scar doesnt hurt youwill have to break into my house and vandalize my beloved book before that changesin the interest of fairness i will say that i thoroughly enjoy the character of scorpious malfoy and have the play follow his schooldays adventure with albus potter i would have willingly purchase a paper copy of that story instead of whatever it be the play actually be it wasnt just that i didnt like how much it change thing and character the script just really didnt hold my attention i keep drift off while read and i use to read shakespeare play script a a child so it wasnt the format that bore me it just wasnt good and wasnt harry potter ,0,1,1962
it nineteen year later and harry potter be a grown man with three child ready to head off to hogwarts his eldest son albus severus potter isnt that great at magic get sort into slytherin and become best friend with draco malfoys son scorpius albus be lose in the shadow of his famous father and a bit of a disappointment to everyone around except scorpius harry be beleaguer both by draco who want harry to squash rumor that scorpius be really the son of voldemort and by amos diggory who blame harry for his son cedrics death during the triwizard tournament way back in harry potter and the goblet of fire in an attempt to impress his dad albus and scorpius steal a time turner from the ministry of magic and with the help of amoss niece delphi try to save cedrics life a with most time travel story go back in the past to make thing good inevitably make them worsewhile the story itself be interesting enough though average to poor by harry potter standard the book suffers from be a script a lot of the stage direction and action seem hard if not impossible to produce on stage for example polyjuice potion be use to change one character into another there be a lot of location and magical fight that be hard to picture a convincing on the stage an early montage sequence where albus age a few year be less effective because i wonder how they could possibly pull it off convincingly the experience of see a production and how impressively they handle thing would be much good than reading and scratch one head at the improbability of execute it welli would much rather have read the original story than the play version of the story read a play be a less experience precisely because the play be suppose to be produce on a stage with actor costume set et cetera it like read sheet music rather than listen to a song the full experience just isnt there of course the execution of the song could be wonderful or horrible depend on the performer skill or lack thereof a novel version of this story would be good for me because id rely on imagine the story rather than imagine it a a stage productionmy advice would be to wait around for a production to come to a city near you or wait for a novel version or the probably inevitable movie version ,0,1,2246
harry potter be one of the most singular define moment of my generation we anticipate and devour each book a it arrive embrace see our favourite character on the big screen year after year i love these character and their strange magical sometimes dark universe simply put l grow up with hogwartsi want to find out what happen to my childhood friend i have grow up and so have they we last get a glimpse of their future a harry and ginny waive goodbye to son albus on the train that would take him to his first year at hogwarts harry potter and the cursed child pick up exactly at that moment we be leave off all these year ago to be honest harry potter and the cursed child be not quite the hp l grow up with many factor come into play for one it doesnt feel write by the same author the pace be alter and it be not a complex and rich a be usual jk rowling approve the script but it seem thats all she didsometimes word speak or action take by the character feel slightly out of place when rowling write the book she know the character inside out and there be no question that fact a such many fan feel like they know these character it be interest to see how harry and other character age but l cant help but imagine some potterheads might be disappoint by some of their beloved wizard action l find myself question some action think they be out of line with the character on occasion l felt they be deadon with ron and at time l think they be make him out to be a big goof with little substancehowever much of the intrigue and action of cursed child lie in two character albus severus potter and scorpius malfoy child of draco malfoy a lot of cursed child development happen between those two character to have this much weight cast upon a new addition in the harry potter world be a considerable and bold move a good portion of the book focus on the boy relationship in the hp book we know harry ron and hermione be great friend and mean a lot to one another we werent remind of that fact every five minute neither do we have it shove down our throat the way curse child do with albus and scorpius which wasnt necessarywithout reveal too much harry potter and the cursed child have more to do with timetravelling and alternate dimension and frankly what ifs than anything else it mildly interesting but mostly confuse the idea of revisit the past be baffle in the first place i feel jk rowling would have move forward in her storytelling not backwards fan have become attach to the story a they already be and it doesnt allow this new chapter of the hp universe to truly be it own in fact all these time travel element hinder from the cursed child feel like it own story too much of the play be focus on specific event that happen in the past that be force to revisit part l be mildly interesting but the good element of the first start to derail in the second the end be fit but didnt feel particularly reward there be a big theme in harry and draco difficult relationship with their son and the struggle of fatherhood this add a different perspective to the character and franchise if you be hop for another traditional hp volume this be not it by any meanssurely some be apprehensive at the idea of the book be write a a play instead of a novel l know l have doubt the play format work surprisingly well i be impress by how strong of a flow curse child have give it format the brief description and narration complement the storyharry potter and the cursed child will no doubt be a divisive topic among fan of the series it not to say it all bad i like some aspect of the book and felt it flaw in others it not the heartwarming story it aim to be curse child struggle with it legacy try a it might this chapter doesnt feel like the true continuation of the tale of our beloved wizard there be simply less magic this time around 2 12 star ,0,1,3845
