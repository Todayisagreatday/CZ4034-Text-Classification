I blindly pre-ordered this 8th book back in March, without realizing it was a play script instead of like the other clever, witty, well-written stories of before. My mistake completely on that.

Anyway, even though I despise script reading because I find it to be choppy and hard to let imagination flow smoothly, thought I'd give it a try because no Harry Potter book could be bad, right? Wrong. Lacking everything that made the other Harry Potter books so great, from the very first dull act of the first lame scene.

It being a play does not justify flat characters, lack of detail, poor plot, and incongruence. Shakespeare wrote plays and they read fantastically, no live performance is required to appreciate them. The ""necessity"" to see HP and the Cursed Child live does not justify the poor and lazy writing style.

I highly doubt that JK Rowling wrote this at all -- my suspicion is that she just put her name on it and received a check for allowing them to use the characters, and the work itself was by the other authors.

Cursed Child read like bad fan fiction.  It was entirely lacking in what made Harry Potter so good -- character development and clever plot twists, all woven in with humor in a wonderful coming of age story and magical adventure.  The characters in Cursed Child were one dimensional and behaved in ways that were totally out of character, the plot was predictable and just plain awful, and it jumped from scene to scene in a way that was jarring and disjointed. Throughout the book, I found myself thinking multiple times, 'That character would never have said/done that' or 'This doesn't feel like HP'. It was a struggle to finish.

My advice is -- if you're a fan of Harry Potter, skip Cursed Child and save your money.

An absolute disgrace to the Potter name.

I can't even begin to tell you how uncomfortable most of the dialogue makes me. What's worse is the series of events that Albus Potter and his friend Scorpius Malfoy get themselves into...I wanted to strangle them.

And that's too bad, because seeing them become friends and grow together was occasionally touching...but wow, they do some stupid s***! Stupid beyond any rationality, just unforgivably stupid things that are up there with the Three Stooges.

The best scenes are probably between Harry and Albus, but even those leave me feeling mixed. I feel like the strongest point of this story is the development of Harry as a father. It's understandable that a guy who was raised most of his life without parents would hit a few bumps in the road when being a parent himself.

I also think the dialogue of Hermione, Draco, Ginny, and a few brief scenes with Dumbledore's portrait are good. Unfortunately, the story is more focused on revisiting the past, which deducts time for us to get acquainted with new characters or new magical phenomena (like we normally get in other Potter installments). It's got too much fan-service for my taste, which bums me out.The whole damn thing reads like fan-fiction.

I can only imagine at this time how beautiful a live performance must be, but it will never be forgiven for the LOADS of retconning and TACKY plot devices that make a joke out of this once reputable franchise

Despite a few good scenes here and there, it's a total farce. It plays out more like a bad TV miniseries on the Disney channel.

If counted in the series, it's undoubtedly the worst. But for the sanctity of my Harry Potter experience, I'd rather consider this a ""what if?"" story. And as long as there's no movie or official novelization of the script, I think that's a fair assessment. This script wasn't even written by JK.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I love reading plays, and I've loved Harry Potter for most of my life. This book wasn't bad because it was a play, it was bad because it was just bad. I knew that JK Rowling didn't write this, but rather was a consultant on it. Because of that, I strongly believed that the writers of this play would not be allowed to take this beautiful universe that she created and pervert it. I was wrong.

It read like fanfiction (bad fanfiction) and what was done to the characters that I grew up with is unforgivable. I'm shocked and disgusted that JK Rowling would put her name on this.

If you truly want to read this, I won't say don't do it, but I would recommend borrowing it from someone who has a copy rather than spending your money on it because it's just not worth it.

I read the reviews but didn't think much of all the one-stars. I figured hardcore Harry Potter fans were just being too harsh in reviewing after years of inventing their own futures for all the beloved characters.

I was so wrong.

I want to stress that I really really wanted to like this addition to the Harry Potter canon.  I even wanted to read it quickly so I could get to Amazon to leave a great review, defending the plot and characters. Unfortunately, it truly did fall short in my eyes.  The characters don't seem like themselves, the plot seems rushed and full of holes, and there are so many unnecessary and incompatible story inclusions that seem incorporated just to be able to revisit old characters. I was, regrettably, disappointed.

SPOILERS ---->
First, I agree with many of the comments left here in that having Albus Potter be sorted into Slytherin was great.  However, there was no explanation of why and no vindication for Slytherin House either.  I would have hoped that Slytherin was finally shown in good light, but this did not really happen either.  There were hardly any signs of ambition or leadership in Albus or Scorpius.  How did they end up in Slytherin, anyway? Also, why was there no mention of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff?

The idea that Albus and Scorpius wouldn't understand (or care about) the consequences of using a time turner to change a significant historical event at the age of 14 is preposterous.  Even if Scorpius was mildly tempted just to follow his friend, he would be smart enough to try to dissuade Albus from actually making any changes in history.  He is portrayed as smart like Hermione, but this certainly didn't fit.  And to try to set things right by doing it a second time? And on top of that, doing something entirely different that second time hoping it would put things back in order?!  Please.

The biggest plot issue I had was that Voldemort has a child, and with Bellatrix Lestrange before the Battle of Hogwarts, no less.  We saw Bellatrix in book 7 in detail the year before she died.  As someone pointed out, the idea that she was pregnant while fighting Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Malfoy Manor and no one notice is absurd.  Maybe I'm missing something in the timeline on this one.  Also, Voldemort would have planned much better than to leave his descendant with no proper care or plan for the future.  Voldemort took every precaution and went further than any wizard known in history to assure his immortality. He would have had similar care and preparation for his plan B.

Finally, there is a big issue with the characters in this story.  I thought that the reviews of changing characters might be attributed to them growing into adulthood.  Now, though, I really don't think so. There was a mix of odd sappy behavior and furious rages from Harry who had always been respectful of others and learned to control his emotions towards the end of the series. Hermione was preoccupied and sloppy. Ron was no longer witty or clever but included as some kind of foolish comic relief.  Draco was the peaceful voice of reason.  It really didn't make sense to me.  As for the flashbacks, they seemed so forced and unnecessary - only existing to give the audience a chance to revisit characters.  Even they were disappointing revivals, though.  Dumbledore seemed emotional and unhelpful, Cedric was full of spite, and Snape was sentimental and kindhearted (even if Snape was good in the end, he was never one to get emotional - he himself states that it is a key to his Occlumency skills!).  Very disappointing.
<----

I could go on but why.  All in all, I was let down.  I expected much more than this.  Perhaps it was my high expectations after so many years or re-reading the magnificent original 7 immediately before I picked this up, but I did not enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. By all means, read it since it is supposedly canon now, but don't expect to be impressed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have loved each and every Harry Potter book and thought they were well-plotted and delightfully written.  JK Rowling always had an ear for really nice words and made up some really good ones as well as creating a delightful set of traditions and rules of magic.

Unfortunately, this book simply does not belong with the others.The format as a play does not work.  Much of what brings the novels to life is brilliant description so you get a sense of place and character.  The format loses that.  Worse, the dialog is dull.  The use of language is really poor.  Even though I am an ardent Potter fan, I simply could not make it through this book.  It was just too boring.  The plot dragged, the conversation was stilted and, thanks to the dramatic format, there was no sense of place, whatever.

I fell in love with the book and enjoyed reading the series with my children.  I  was very surprised when I found out J. K. Rowling  had written another Harry Potter book and  could not wait to read it.  I am an elementary school teacher and had planned to buy at least  one copy of this book for the school library.  The librarian does not bother to put returned Harry Potter books on the shelf when they are returned because they are immediately checked out again.  I am not buying this book for the library.

Ms. Rowling you should be ashamed of yourself.  This ""book"" /play is poorly written.  It is not in your writing voice or style.  It lacks details and imagination.  It was advertised as the eighth book in the series and you were the author.  It is not the eighth book and you did not write it, you contributed ideas.

Prior to reading this very poorly written play I was hoping it would comes to the states.  After reading the play I have no desire to see it.

While I do not recommend reading this book/play some people may enjoy it.  I read at least four books a week and rarely write reviews.  I  feel you should read a book or see a play and then decide for yourself if it is good or bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling needed the extra income, and she certainly did not need this to add to her fame. The co-authors were palpably the main authors of this play, and they were riding Rowling's coattails. I love the Harry Potter books, and have found them witty, imaginative, clever, engaging, and often profound. They certainly have the potential to become lasting classics in literature, even if there are some inconsistencies and less than stellar passages in them. I also like to read stage plays, not just watching them performed on stage. I remember reading Shakespeare's plays right before attending performances - and both the reading and the performances were enjoyable in their own rights. Thus, I have no problem with the format of the story ""HP & the Cursed Child.""

My problem is with the contrived story line, the character representation (in Ron's case it was particularly a misrepresentation, in light of the original series), the absence of Rowling's usual linguistic creativity, the dominantly bland lines, and that the play failed to add to the overall HP Universe. This is particularly disturbing because a typical HP book was a learning experience for the young readers: the story had deep and consistent moral message, which is missing here. In fact, the book rings hollow. Deathly hollow...

I would rather neglect that this book is part of the official canon, and treat it as a mediocre unauthorized fan fiction. That would keep the integrity of the neatly complete 7-book series. With writing like this, Harry Potter would have never become a mega hit.

Just one SPOILER here: Albus and Scorpius want to notify Harry about their location (time and place). Thus, they create a message they know would wind up in Harry's hands and be revealed to him in the future. To be clear, the idea (in a different version and obviously without magic) was used in Isaac Asimov's ""The End of Eternity."" I don't know whether the authors were aware of Asimov's fiction, but it is certainly one of the better known time travel novels. So, this ""major punchline"" in the story was rather predictable and unoriginal.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_167?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=167&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

And I haven't been disappointed with really any of her other choices as an artist or public figure, both inside and outside Harry Potter.

That being said, this was terrible. Many of the details fundamentally contradict established rules in the universe, especially regarding time travel.

It didn't. I have loved the Harry Potter books  since I first read them. They were beautifully written stories that changed my life. But this script includes some mildly witty dialogue, but overall left me extremely disappointed and at times angry with the disservice it gave to the original stories.

The magical theory and some of the facts they reference make no sense or are just not possible in the Harry Potter world. The time travel theory made no sense. Outside of the fact that it contradicts the way time travel worked in the books, this script contradicts itself with the way that changes in the past effects the future.

The characterizations seemed inconsistent at best. There were certainly echoes of the canon characters, but not enough to be convincing. The only character with a distinct voice and viewpoint that consistently jumped off the page was Scorpius. The plot was wrought with cheap thrills and cliches. Many of the plot twists seem are reminiscent of a soap opera.

There are certainly touching, funny, inspiring moments Many of the stage directions are written in a lovely way. Yet I will never be able to see it that way because the outrageous plot points and the complete disconnect with the Harry Potter series in terms of magical theory and consistent characterizations. If it had been just a magical story unrelated to the Harry Potter series, it may have been a passable read. And as a play I am sure it could be enthralling with the special effects and acting, but the story cannot stand on its own as a respectable addition to this series.

Of all the stories that JK Rowling could have put her stamp of approval on as the ""eighth"" story I don't understand how this could be it. This has seriously made me forsake the image I still have of her as one my childhood heroes. When the books ended she told the fans he would not expand on the story. After reading this I truly wish she had stuck to that statement. This seems more like a ploy for more fame and monetary gain than a true extension to the novels that captured the attention of millions of fans across the world.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Really? I have a tough time believing this is her work. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2016","First off, I am a huge Harry Potter fan when it comes to the original 7 books and 8 movies. I was one of those kids who had to get the book on day 1 of release, just so I could read until 2am before having my mother yell at me to shut the lights off and go to bed. In which case I'd grab a flashlight just to continue reading. I knew there would be spoilers from others around me if I didn't hurry up and read as much as possible each day. I should also add that prior to Harry Potter I hated reading books with a passion. Finally, I found a series that held my interest from start to finish.

Fast forward to now, as an adult. Yet another Harry Potter book is on the shelves. This time it is a play. That wasn't a problem for me. I've read plays in the past.

Here's a breakdown of what I didn't like:
-It comes off as a poorly written fanfic. It's obvious JK Rowling had very little say in this. Why her name is even on the book is beyond me. This is not her work. Supposedly they agreed on the story together, but I just have a tough time believing this.  It's as if she was too nice to tell Jack Thorne (the real writer) no. She should have disagreed with it for numerous reasons, which I will go into detail below.
-The characters are not themselves, for one. Yes, I understand that 19 years has gone by, but even so that's no excuse for how drastically different some of them were.
-It's all about time travel. We were told all the time turners were destroyed, but now all of the sudden we learn that one time turner still exists that allows you to go back in time for 5 minutes. Harry's son, Albus, and Malfoy's son, Scorpius, are friends who decide to go back in time and save Cedric. Yup, that's the plot. Time travel is the plot.
-Voldemort has a daughter. Bellatrix is the mother. She was pregnant and gave birth in book 7 .... Need I say more? I don't think I have to explain how insane that one is. Anyway, their daughter uses Scorpius and Albus to change the past and basically bring Voldemort back.
-We learn that Cedric's death was a good thing because he'd have become a death eater otherwise. Apparently he was so hurt by losing the Triwizard tournament (after time travel affected everything) and embarrassed that he became a death eater as a result. Again, what!?
-Where's George? We learn Ron is running the joke shop. Cool, but where the heck is George?
-Where are Albus's siblings whenever things go crazy and his life is in danger? It's just Harry and Ginny who freak out. Where's the rest of the family?

I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. I love JK Rowling and will forever love the original Harry Potter series, but again this is not her work. She had very little, if any, say in this. This is Jack Thorne's work and I am not a fan. Sorry to put it so bluntly.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Stage directions are awful (""This scene is all about magic""???) And as far as the series goes, it's completely out of touch, and ruins pretty much every character involved. Ron is reduced to pure comic relief and has no substance whatsoever. Malfoy is.....nice and understanding?? And the plot is just so awful.

I wish I had never read it because it almost ruined Harry Potter for me entirely, but luckily I have since been able to compartmentalize in my head the difference between this craptastic bizarre work of fanfic and the REAL Harry Potter series.  So there's that.

I can't go in depth too much about what I hated without giving any spoilers, but I will say I don't think the tone was consistent with Rowling's style of writing at all (yes, I knew it was a play and I know plays read differently, blah, blah, blah. I just feel this way, OK?). I thought the story line was completely absurd (YES EVEN IN A FICTIONAL WORLD OF MAGIC) and the plot relied too much on old played out themes that have already been explored in numerous other works.  Also, just putting this out there, but Harry's son is an insufferable little brat and I hated him as a character so that didn't really help either.

So, it is with great disappointment (and great Potter experience) that I give this book one star. It isn't that I expected this book to be a novel, or that it is difficult to read in play-form. It is that the writing is so horrible that I cannot believe JK put her name on it. She may have come up with some of the plot points of the storyline, but you can tell she didn't write the incredibly cheesy dialogue or attribute to her characters. It does read as bad fan fiction, and not even from someone that knows much about the potterverse. Ron being played as a fumbling idiot? Harry saying horrible things to his own child? The Slytherin dormitories not being in the dungeons? And, above all else...if you're going to write a play about the next generation, why make the storyline about them going back in time and messing up things that happened in previous books?

I was so excited by the concept of getting a glimpse of the old characters that I loved so much growing up and getting to really meet their children and see their lives.  But I was left with more questions than I entered with.  I understand that this wasn't actually a book, it was a script for a play and that Rowling couldn't include all the details as she could've in a novel.  So for that matter, why couldn't she just write a book?  Why did it have to be a play?
After the seventh book, Rowling insisted, again and again that she was done with the original characters and wouldn't be revisiting them.  But then she did and did so in a way that seemed to be a slap in the face to her fans.  She doesn't seem invested in the story anymore just seems to be experimenting with what the most money she could make with the least amount of work.  It feels like she slapped this together in a week or less and also seems completely detached with what is possible with live performances.  If felt like she thought she was writing a movie, but then settled for a play.
Where was Teddy Tonks?  He wasn't even mentioned but it is implied that since Harry was his guardian, he (and maybe Ginny) raised him since he was orphaned.  I was so excited to see the dynamic of Harry (an orphan with abusive awful guardians) raises another orphan.  But Teddy wasn't even mentioned for a second.  That is insulting to Lupin and Tonks who acted as family to Harry.  Why would Rowling bother writing that detail into the books if she wasn't going to bother sticking to it and keeping him in the picture of the potter family.  A common theme through all the books is Harry desperation for familly.  He was so fixated on his desperation for biological family that he neglects his true family.  Ron, Hermione, the members of DA and others.  So, when Harry does have children, why on earth would he neglect one of them?  It doesn't seem right and all the characters in ""The Cursed Child"" seem like a shell of themselves.
I could write pages and pages on my disappointment with this ""book"" and with the franchise in general at the moment, but no one would read that and I just don't have the time.
Also, this book is $16, which is $15 overpriced than what I believe it is worth.

I came into this book with low expectations as it wasn't actually written by Rowling.  I was afraid it would be too much like a fanfic and pandering to a nostalgic rabid audience instead of developing a strong story.  Unfortunately, my instincts were right on the money.

This book is a shameless money-grab with cardboard cutout characters and an overwrought plot reminiscent of a telenovela.  The dialogue is lackluster and completely unbelievable.  Fan-favorite characters appear in the story more as a roll-call than to add anything of value..  To put it succinctly, it's a hot mess.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are completely unrecognizable.  Specifically, Ron is written as a buffoon who literally points his wand backwards at one point in the story. He has no real role or idea of what's going on.  Harry has regressed into the shouty ball of angst from Order of the Phoenix.  His words and actions are completely out of character.  Hermione basically just nods in agreement and spends her time shooting ""withering"" looks at Ron.  Yikes. Draco is in here too, also reduced to stilted dialogue with no personality. The second generation kids have completely unbelievable dialogue and spend more time professing their friendship love than the average Lifetime movie.  Everyone's dialogue is practically interchangeable, all nuance between character's speech patterns is completely abandoned.

*SPOILERS*

This plot seemed like a writing prompt and a chance to try writing all the favorite characters in the series, living or dead.  I'm shocked that Sirius didn't get dragged into this mess.  My personal (not) favorite was the universe in which Hermione morphs into Snape and openly bullies students. WHAT?! The Time Turner plot was riddled with plot holes and systematically dissembled a decade of world-building with it's underdevelopment.  Also the big reveal about Voldemort's daughter makes zero sense.  The book takes the time to show us the butterfly effect when time meddling through Albus and Scorpius' bungled attempts. Are we supposed to believe that a child of Bellatrix and Voldemort being born while rewriting time would have no ramifications on the present day?

I could write an essay on the failures of this book.  The real mystery is why Rowling would sign off on such a horrific product.  It's not like she is lacking in money, prestige, or power.  I haven't seen the play but I can only assume that the fantastical special effects must be doing a great deal to mask this weakness in this book.  Reading it in book form strips away the glamour to the bones of the story which, unfortunately, leave a lot to be desired. To be a well-crafted script, you must follow the same rules as a well-crafted book.

Don't let nostalgia cloud your judgement. This book does not belong on the shelf next to Deathly Hallows.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It has none of JK Rowling's nuances. The people (at least, the ones that were included in the book) were inauthentic and did not act like themselves. I didn't even recognize Harry Potter because he was such an unlikable jerk. His kids and the Granger-Weasley kids were all unforgivable brats. Harry-Ginny and Hermione-Ron would NEVER have raised bullies (I'm glaring at you James and Rose, and Albus too if you count how rude and disrespectful he is to his father). The plot is weak and boring. I didn't not feel any of the ""magical"" feelings that some people felt. In fact, I feel cheated. I knew this was going to be a script but I didn't know that it was going to be a poorly written script created by someone who probably never read the original 7 Potter books. This book will never be considered a Harry Potter book to me and it will absolutely NOT sit on my shelf with my 7 HP hard backs. Actually, I'm debating how to get rid of it. Either death-by-fire or I could try to convince some other poor fan to take it back from me.

Also, JKR, I can't believe you let some random theater guy tarnish the Harry Potter name by allowing him to publish this garbage. He may have been successful with his other theater productions, but he ruined this novel that should have been full of nostalgic feels rather than terrible characterization and boring, inauthentic whiners.

To anyone whose wondering if they should get this book, be content with the memories you have now of Harry and the gang and don't ruin those memories with this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Mack","Bad Fan Fic. Set on Fire Bad.","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2018","1. HUGE POTTER FAN. Like others, I'm a big fan of Harry Potter books. I've read each one dozens of times. I've listened to Jim Dale's audio books over and aver (entire series on average 4times a year since released.) I have the movies and watch them occasionally, although I don't like them as much as the books. I've stood in line for midnight releases of the books, kids in tow, all in costume. I have Harry Potter treats every Halloween. ( My cockroach clusters are the best. I have candy molds for peppermint toads and chocolate frogs. I've made a series of frog wizard cards based on local celebrities. I bake pumpkin pasties, make Hagrid's  rock cakes, create Nearly Headless Nick's nibbles. I buy lemon drops. I have Hogwarts banners, a crest, robes, scarf. I give out HP temporary tattoos.) I've had an HP wall calendar every year for a decade. I have the Sorcrror's Companion, Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them, the Tales of Needle the Bard. I watched Eddie Redmayne in the Fan Beasts movie.  I'm a huge fan.
I've also read other JK Rowling novels. She's a great writer.
I've read fan fiction. I've hung out on fan websites.I'm a fan!
NOVELS and SCRIPTS. I prefer novels, but I've read hundreds of play scripts. My daughter's an actor, so I've been immersed in theater conventions and scripts for years. I've written novels (NaNoWriMo winner) and play scripts, too. I'm not intimidated or confused by the form, and recognize that reading a script takes a different set of skills to enjoy.
THIS SCRIPT. It's been a struggle to keep reading. SPOILERS. It's plot-driven, not character driven. Harry is mostly unlikeable. Some of the premises are so bad it's a struggle to swallow them. At the start, Harry and Draco hate and distrust each other. It's as if the events of the other books never happened, and these two grown men are back at their 10 year old selves. Harry and his son Albus dislike each other, to extreme degree. For Albus, this is supposedly because he has to live in the shadow of his father's fame. But this just isn't enough. And Ginny is a prop, not a mother or real character in this scenario. The fixation of Albus  on Cedric is odd. The solution to his antagonistic feelings toward his father even less believable. And the coincidences of time turner, ""helpful"" Diggory relative, and incredibly inept Hermione Granger protection pile up to such an extent it strains credulity in a fantasy world where we are already to believe in magic.
What's good is that the scenes are short. I like Draco's interpretation of the darkness around Al. There are moments where I really like Scorpius. But, as others have said, it's just bad fan fic.
I've read through part1 and am almost finished with Act 3 in Part 2. I'm not sure I'll finish. It's that unbelievable, bad, and disappointing.
I was going to give this book to my daughter. Now I think I'll set it on fire. It's that bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If J.K. Rowling wrote a single word of it, I would be very surprised. More likely, it was written by her co-authors and she just okayed it. Can't say I blame her, money is money, but it does make me lose some respect for her.
The piece reads like a glorified Fan Fiction. The characters, both old and new, are one-dimensional compared to how they're represented in the original seven Harry Potter books. There are a number of sins I could mention, but the clincher was definitely Snape smiling in an alternate reality. And he wasn't even smiling because of someone else's pain! As a hardcore Harry Potter fan, I nearly died of heartbreak at this point in the story.
That said, the ending wasn't too bad, compared to the rest of the piece. Overall a very disappointing read. Not impressed, J.K. Please try again.

It's extremely difficult to see that Harry Potter grows up to loose almost every trait that ever made the character appealing to begin with, that he has in fact experienced negative character growth since the end of the series and that the status quo of his life has changed exactly none. As for the plot, I'm afraid I've read better fanfictions with the same premise. In fact, I mixed the details of this up with one of those fanfictions as soon as I was done reading it and when I sorted out the specifics I found all the better points belonged to the fanfiction. The fact that the function and rules of a time-turner had to be changed in order to accommodate this unfortunate mess does not endear any of the three authors to me. And, as has been stated in other reviews, this script is as similar to the Harry Potter series in tone as a carpenter ant is to a ballpoint pen.

 I wouldn't even say I'm disappointed. More that I'm currently doing my best to Obliviate this from my memory, lest I actually allow the horrors committed against the characters to affect my fond memory of them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This book is bad Fan Fiction. Most of the characters felt terribly OUT of character, like someone was trying to force these characters into a specific plot but ultimately failed. I agree with other reviewers that it didn't make sense for Albus to be so clueless as to why people were staring during the Epilogue but now not only be totally aware of his father's ""legacy"", but resentful of it as well. I actually really enjoyed Scorpius' character - best part of the book, in my opinion, and I liked that Albus and Scorpius became friends. The rest is just not worth reading.

The writing itself isn't bad, and it's formatted like a screenplay so it's a quick read. Unfortunately, that's about all positive I can say. All the characters that you know and love get completely ignored or are so out of character you might as well be reading a story about the actors who played them. The new characters (i.e. the kids of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, etc.) get into misadventures that read like a bad fanfiction and the entire plotline (won't spoil anything) is a convoluted mess that leaves you feeling like someone confundus'd you.

I have been a loyal Harry Potter fan for years, but this book just ruined everything! It wasn't even true to the characters! Harry's this angery, soppy, stupid, egotistical, WORST character I have ever read about. What happened to the loyal, brave boy everyone loves? He would never threaten Hogwarts! Ever! The harry I know would have been proud his son was bridging the gap between malfoys and potters. Even if he was a little upset he would have encouraged his son to continue with his friendship. I also hated the time travel. It NEVER works out in a book. Cedri. Diggory a death eater, come on! That was the pinnicle of unbelievable. Dumbledore is a washed up tragedy, he ALREADY apologized people! Ron and Hermione were complete jokes😩 Ron would never get drunk at his wedding, and Hermione was about as smart as a zombie! But the absolute worst part was that Voldemort had a daughter. Sigh. Everyone in the entire harry potter universe KNOWS that that would never happen. He would never attatch himself to another person. Dumblesore makes that VERY clear. So to anyone reading this review, don't east your time or money. This waste of space in the universe doesn't deserve it.

I loved the Harry Potter series.  Though I have never watched the movies, the books were great fun to read with interesting characters, fun stories, and kept me intrigued throughout the series. This.....this book is a mess. I can handle the fact that the book is a play- in fact I love plays- but the story and writing is atrocious. The characters are NOTHING like their former selves . Harry blackmailed and threatened FREAKING MCGONAGALL while she meekly cowered. Hermione is insanely stupid in this book, not only keeping a dangerous object instead of destroying it (this being the same witch who abhorred rule breaking and was essentially the conscious of the trio mind you) but to have incredibly weak security over it.  Ron was never my favorite character, but he's horrid in this as nothing more than another Homer Simpson. Ginny was so boring I forgot she was in her scenes majority of the time. Cedric apparently was one embarrassing misstep from becoming a death eater....so there's that. Snape... my biggest gripe with the characters lies in the pointless fan service he is. He serves NO purpose in being reintroduced into the story and the fact that he is back makes absolutely no sense considering Snape was killed before Neville attempted to attack Nagani and for the (incorrect) purpose of owning the elder wand. Snape was then able to (with his dying breaths) share his memories that allowed Harry to understand he was a horcrux as well. Those events ultimately lead to Voldemort believing he killed Harry and joining the battle at Hogwarts. HOW WOULD NEVILLE'S DEATH PREVENTED ANY OF THAT?!  The ONLY reason he was back is so fans can scream OMG SNAAAPPPPEEEE.

Finally the story is riddled with plot holes not limited to:
Voldemort has a daughter.....by Bellatrix......before the battle of Hogwarts

Hermione then telling the caught daughter that she'll be sent to prison with her mother.....the mother that was killed by Molly Weasley...guess they're keeping her rotting corpse in prison

Albus and Scorpius sending a note on Harry's baby blanket from the past to future Harry with invisible potion ink letting them know where they were in the past. Ignoring the sheer stupidity of that sentence, why on Earth would they do that when those children had no reason to believe that Harry had a second time turner (that apparently is more special than the time turner the children had)

The plot convenient injuries caused by the time turner with no rhyme or reason to it. In fact, it's never explained where the injuries come from or why they don't happen every time it was used.

Overall the only reason I'm willing to give 1 star is because Scorpius’' character was enjoyable (to Albus' incredibly annoying one) and I rented the book at the library for free. The story was terrible and I spent majority of the book skimming it, wishing it were over.

Oh and the trolley witch grows claws and throws exploding pumpkin pastries.

 I wish I were lying.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry is nothing like Harry in the book and the warmness of Harry and Albus  at the end of Harry Pottter #7 rang true,  however the cold relationship between them in the play was.....  just not authentic.

What can I say? The original series was so important to me, and I wanted to be sure the eighth book would meet my expectations.

Let's just say that after I read those spoilers, I wondered if the summary I found was a prank. If maybe J.K. Rowling had decided to protect her secret by giving each attendee the summary of the most ridiculous plot ever conceived, with orders to analyze that and only that online. Well, the actual script has been released.

It's not a prank.

I wish I could do what other reviewers are doing, and cling to ""Jo didn't write this! She just approved the script!"" Sadly, I followed her on Twitter during the casting and rehearsal stage, and so I saw many, many updates about this play. She may have ""only"" given script approval, but she also came up with the idea, was involved with casting, watched rehearsals, gave interviews about how much she hoped readers and viewers would love it, and promoted the hell out of it on her Twitter account. The only thing I can conclude from all this is that J.K. Rowling, who wrote one of my favorite series of all time, actually thinks this play is GOOD.

This baffles me.

Now, I could complain all day about how the plot sounds like it was lifted straight out of several bad fanfics; or how canon characterization is routinely assassinated for cheap shock value; or how shoddy the worldbuilding is; or how canon is violated more often than in the worst Mary Sue story to grace Fanfiction.net, but everything is just so ridiculous that I can't take it seriously. I can't see it as a viable threat to canon, even though it IS canon. The quality is too low.

Congratulations, Cursed Child. You have been relegated to the realm of bad fanfic, at least for this reader.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I went into it with an open mind having already seen a lot bad reviews and knowing it was a script. Which doesn't really matter at the end of the day if you enjoy the book because what does it matter what the entire Internet is saying if you like the book. And I'm a huge fan of the series and the characters. I have a bunch of shirts collectibles and have read the series multiple times. But there are no other words to describe this book besides epic fail.
 The book was just not good. The plot is a mess and has so many plot holes. For instance Harry Potter, HARRY FRICKIN POTTER would NEVER NOT EVER tell his son he wished he wasn't his son. The boy who always wished he had a father and the boy who always valued friendship above all would never say something like that. He just wouldn't. I liked that Albus was in Slytherian and was best friends with Scorpius I'll give them that but everything else was a mess. For starters the time turners are back. Why in the world would they think it was a good idea to bring time turners back! They only bring plot holes and they are just not a good addition to the story. And Hermione Granger is one of the brightest minds of her generation, so why would she hide such a valuable object such as a time turner in a simple riddled book case. She just wouldn't because she would know it could be figured out easily. And why is Ron like barely in the plot at all. It's as if HE'S the spare. And don't even get me started on the whole Voldemort having a daughter thing. Voldemort, the man incapable of love could NEVER put him self in such an intimate situation as to sleep with Bellatrix Lestange and then have a daughter. That mean Bellatrix would had to have been very pregnant while touring Hermione in that house and she didn't even look it. But whatever it's more like a fan fiction so of course there would be lots of plot holes but there's just to many for this to have JKR creation. And didn't Harry always say he wanted to be and Auror? Not head of magical law enforcement. And why, WHY did Albus kiss Hermione, SEVERAL times! She's his aunt! But I will not let this book affect my opinions towards the series because I know JKR would never write something like this. Honestly if I wanted to find closure for the series I'd just read some fan fiction. Save yourself the time and MONEY, like the book was $17-- And don't buy this book. Don't disturb your feelings toward the series because this a wreck of a novel.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But that's because I had hyped myself up and wanted to love it SO MUCH that I basically forced myself to. I'm OBSESSED with everything Harry Potter, and I mean OBSESSED. So basically if I didn't love this I felt like I was betraying my favorite series in the whole world. Slowly after the initial reading when I started actually analyzing and thinking about what I just read, I realized what an absolute piece of trash it is as far as a Harry Potter story goes. The characters were literally not even remotely similar to the characters we know and love. The story was just one big giant plot hole and inconsistency. I don't care that it was written in play form, I knew ahead of time that this was a screenplay for the play. I'm talking about the story itself which is horrible and terrible and NOTHING like Harry Potter.

So before this turns into a pages long rant, I'll stop myself. This is what I think of this story: Compared to the ACTUAL Harry Potter series, it's TRASH. BUT so are the movies compared to the books (not anywhere near as much trash as the Cursed Child though.) So basically while I pretty much hate this story, I take it with a grain of salt because there is a TON of stuff I hate about the movies too. So I would never destroy this book (I collect EVERYTHING I can HP so it's still part of the collection) and honestly I might see the play just to experience that because I'll be in New York next year when it starts on Broadway. But unless you are like me and pretty much compulsively by HP stuff just to add to your collection, don't even bother. And I pretty much worship anything that comes out of JK's mouth but I don't care what she says, the Cursed Child will NEVER be canon.

So in summary: the Harry Potter books are a billion times better than the Harry Potter movies which are a billion times better than the Cursed Child.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's not the script format that is bothersome to me, it's literally everything else about the book. There is a profound lack of consistency with the previous seven novels' worth of painstaking character development, the plot is contrived and awful, and the overall effort completely and totally misses the magic of the original series. Knowing that JK didn't write this, I had very managed expectations going into the book and I was still incredibly disappointed and shocked at the quality of this release.

I'm not sure what JK was thinking when she participated in or approved this project, but it's terrible. I am told by other reviewers that it apparently works better on stage, where there are flashing lights and special effects to distract people from the trope-filled, derivative plotting and completely incompetent characterization, but unfortunately on the page it's a complete mess. I wish I hadn't read it and could perform a memory charm on myself so I could pretend it didn't exist.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is a poorly written play that cannot be part of the canon, because, it is a nonsensical drivel , even for a virgin Harry Potter reader. I only began reading Harry Potter books to my children in that last 5 years. My children are casual fans who like to sleep while I read these books. I got the play at the insistence of my 7-year old who is obsessed with the books and movies of late. I read the play with a text to speech app as the incoherent story began to bore me. There was some magic, but the characters were so stupid, they really numbed me to the action during scenes. Then there are the questions you keep asking as you read this poorly thought out  play: Why is James Potter the older son not the protagonist of this play ? Why is Hermione not Hermione? Why is Ron so obnoxious and unintelligent? Why would Hermione stay with such a husband? Why is any of his happening to people we do not like at all? The play is meant to be a dark thing for adult audiences to enjoy yet the tropes, jokes and theme are very juvenile. These questions haunt you as you try to finish this haphazard prop that panders to nostalgia yet forgets its audience.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I knew it was a bad omen since Albus went into Slytherin. I sniffled when Albus was horrible at Quidditch. I threw the book across my room when the horrible time turner showed up. I almost threw myself out of the window when I realized Delphi was the daughter of Voldemort. Wasn't Voldemort unable to love?! Ew, just ew. Bad fanfic.

It is hugely disappointing, disjointed and there is no flow to the story.  I seriously considered returning the book.  Had I not purchased it with a gift certificate I might have done so. But I've read it so ethically I keep it.  Better to have ended the story line with the last true Rowling book than to have pulled this substandard stunt.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_169?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=169&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I don't care if there are a million versions of reality: there are things that make you who you are no matter the circumstances, and taking a hero and turning him into a villain for the most pedestrian reason is beyond infuriating.

A ridiculous story line coupled with twisted versions of beloved characters mashed together with a few flashbacks in an extremely awkward format. Not at all an enjoyable or engaging read.

First, why did they not pay somebody to turn this into a novelization of the play. It would have been easier to read and follow. This comes across as a purely moneymaking product. They seem to have obviously thought that the legions of loyal Harry Potter fans will buy this no matter what so why bother fleshing it out into a book. Just let the suckers fork over their money for this horrible product.

But honestly even had it been rewritten as a novel, the story is ridiculous. And the familiar Potter characters have been twisted into bad caricatures of themselves. Time and again I found myself thinking that's not at all the behavior or dialogue I'd expect from the characters as they were written in the original books. This reads to me more like it was written by someone who disliked the books and rejected the basic friendship, honor, and sacrifice themes of the original stories.

I cannot believe that this was approved and embraced by Rowling to the extent that she wanted her name front and center on this. That this is the continuation she chose for her beloved Harry Potter series baffles me. That this was really the best they thought they could come up with as a so-called 8th installment to the series is extremely sad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I can’t bear being that disappointed again.  And yet, here we are.

I don’t like fantasy lit, but I adore the Harry Potter books.  Why?  I’ve never been able to answer that clearly.  Now I know.

I like the narrative, not just the story-telling (none of that here), but the brushstrokes of character development applied by the narrator’s word choice, the incorporation of setting into the plot.  Oh yes, and here there’s virtually no plot. Rather than the unexpected twists and twists Rowling gave us in the real books, this has a circumstance – plot is too strong a word.  The circumstance emerges with the props (no spoilers here) and is instantly apparent to anyone who has ever read, well, a book.  Besides being obvious, the circumstance is stupid.  It’s a failed Saturday Night Live skit.

I could go on and on.  I won’t.  (Even though I teach a class called “Harry Potter and the Renaissance Epic.”)  Instead, I’m concluding with a revision of the best line from any presidential-year debate EVER:  Lloyd Benson to Dan Quayle:

K. Rowling. This is NOT a Harry Potter novel by J. K. Rowling. The characters, albeit, may have the same names, glasses, hair color, etc.; however,  those are the ONLY similarities. They share absolutely none of the characteristics of the characters created by JKR - their personalities, morals ... everything, have nothing in common with the characters we've all grown up with, laughed with, cried with, hurt with, loved with ... fell in love with by JKR.  IF you go into this book with these thoughts in mind, perhaps you may enjoy this story?  Perhaps not?

With this said, I would LOVE to have the chance to ask (beg ... lol) J. K. Rowling:  Please, please, please write more Harry Potter novels (by yourself, only)!!! Your fans want more Harry Potter!!! We miss them and want MORE!!  (But, please do so as if the Cursed book was never created, never existed, just ... never was, period.)

Rowling had a baby named Harry Potter. Harry will forever be the cursed child because she neglected her baby and farmed out the writing of this installment in the series to a couple of hacks. This book is some world class garbage, it is the Phantom Menace of the wizarding world. I adore the Harry Potter books and movies, but this thing is an embarrassment. Two paragraphs in and I was shaking my head in dismay at how awful it was. It is a dreadful mess, and a total train wreck from beginning to end. These other 2 authors were a disastrous choice, and have no business anywhere near a keyboard. Every single line of dialogue is tragically “on the nose”, and every character speaks in a generic voice. You could swap any line of dialogue between characters and it would no make a difference. Every character has been washed of their personalities, no one sounds or behaves like they do in the books. I won’t even get into the author’s childish understanding of how time travel works. The present ceases to exist the moment someone travels back in time to change the future. Duh. I’ve read fan fiction that put this effort to shame. So lame.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm as starved for new Harry Potter content as any other fan, but this book is sadly disappointing. I think the thing that disappoints me most is the lack of continuity among characters from the original series. None of the original characters keep their personalities or traits in this book. They just don't have the same feel. Hermoine talks to Ron like a child, Ginny and Harry are nothing similar to who they were in the original series. The characters I loved in the HP series are gone, replaced by some loosely related, poorly written shadows, really only the same in name.  I've read other reviews that say this book is like poorly written fan fiction, and I must say I agree. There is nothing connecting this book the the original series. The story is convoluted, the plot is disorganised and at times pointless. There is no trace of the magic and passion with which JK Rowling wrote the HP series. It's a scattered,  pointless mess. It takes away all of the feelings left at the end of HP, when you're left staring into a future unmarred by Voldemort, wondering or hoping or writing a continuation of your own,  and replaces it with a story unfitting to the original series. And unfortunately, it vastly fails to match the feeling, magic, or effort given to thr HP series. What a shame.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_96?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=96&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The thing that upset me the most about this abook was the behavior of our beloved Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  Their behavior was so out of character, which made this challenging to read and incredibly disappointing.

Hermione was always my favorite character in the series, so when I read this, I found myself incredibly disappointed and surprised that J.K. Rowling would have agreed to let anyone do this to such an incredible series.

Not only did Hermione not offer any solutions or act in any way like the character we all know and love, but Ron's primary role in the book served as comedic relief or to talk about being hingry.  That was it.  Anyone who claims to have loved this series would NEVER have written anything like this.

This does not belong on my shelf with the series.  Not even close.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As I was reading it, I kept thinking that it felt like I was reading bad fanfiction.

I can't enumerate all the plotholes and character issues, but here are some highlights SPOILER ALERT:

The reason that time travel works for me in PoA is that it is abundantly clear that Harry and Hermione were always there - there was never an alternate timeline or alternate universe. As Harry says, he knew he could cast the patronus because he had already done it. This is not the case in TCC. And having saved two extra magical time turners? I could not suspend my disbelief for that.
On a related note, it seemed that many of the magical laws that had been established in 1-7 were ignored, such as taking a month to brew polyjuice potion. And transforming Harry to look like Voldemort, then having the transformation wear off?

And don't get me started on the character assassinations. Ron was like a caricature of himself, oafish and drunk. And Voldemort having a secret child??? It would have been much more believable to have the enemy be a Death Eater who remained in hiding.
END SPOILERS

To be fair, there were parts that I thought how cool this must look on stage. However, without  the bells and whistles of a stage production to distract from the dialogue and plot, it was impossible to ignore the multitude of major problems.
If you take my advice, don't read this. Preserve the memory of the untarnished seven books.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The hogwarts express trolley witch has claws and polices the train now?! What?! So ridiculous.
  I truly believe if JK Rowling has written this story by herself the result would've kept with the beauty and wonderment of the Harry Potter universe. BUT as she did not, this miserable embarrassment of a story is something that I am chalking up as an insult to the Harry Potter character and dumping from my memory.
  Of course some JK Rowling sheep will love it and cheer for a encore but the reality of it is that the three wonderfully amazing children who saved the world and banded together grew up to be stupid, hateful adults who speak like 12 year olds? I sincerely hope not. Maybe the next play will feature another time turner and make it so this one never happened.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

What I'm saying is, I am one of those Potterheads that would love to read more in this universe, learn more about the Marauders, would even consider attending a HP convention.

All that said, I hated this book. I know, it's a play. But I've read plays, and they are better than this. The writing was like fan fiction--that thought came to me multiple times while reading the book. The characters were terribly one-dimensional; we learned almost nothing about the new characters, and the old ones didn't feel like themselves at all. The story felt a lot like the marathon camping from DH, which wasn't really my favorite part of the series. It felt repetitive and boring. And the big bombshell was so unbelievable, so soap-opera like, so ridiculous that I wondered what ACTUAL fanfic I could read that would help me forget what I read here.

I wish I had never read this. I'm going to pretend I didn't; it's not canon. If only it had been in the Room of Requirement during the Battle of Hogwarts. I never thought I could be disappointed in HP or JKR, but damn...

THIS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER BOOKS. First, it's written as a screen play, so background stories are short and limited. Second, the plot line is terrible. Voldemort having a daughter and not knowing?? Harry and his son having no relationship whatsoever?? Draco having no hard feelings to his ex enemies?? Ughhh. The characters are shallow and altered forms of the beloved ones Rowling wrote; I have a hard time believing Harry would tell his son he wish he wasn't his son sometimes?!? Also, Harry's other children deserve more representation and are given like 1% of words in the entire novel. Why the heck would Ron be running the joke shop?! George should be doing that, unless Fred's death really kept him from doing his job, which I doubt , but otherwise that should be stated! The believable parts are that Hermione is running the ministry, since she's probably the most qualified witch out there to do so. But even then, I have a hard time believing she is content with running the wizard world while her spouse is at home with the kids. Ugh, it made me sad to read it but I obviously had to finish to see if it had any redeemable qualities. The friendship between Scorpius and Albus was nice, but also lacked depth and detail, like everything else in this play.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Among the bad things,
1.  Brewing of polyjuice within hours and not a month.  Somehow polyjuice also now changes the voice.  Still not sure how hair was obtained.
2.  Ron is shown as a dolt and seems to follow everything Hermione says
3.  Harry is a pretty insensitive dad

The good things about the book are that some of the concepts are a little interesting and that Scorpius Malfoy is actually endearing in several parts. That's pretty much it.

The bad things are that a lot of the concepts are convoluted or just make no sense in the grand scheme. The plot itself is a hot mess. A lot of the characters are badly written and even just parts of the story are badly written. I don't know why, but I'm still really stuck on the fact that 'darker, blacker robes' that Scorpius ended up in during one of the timelines.

Most of characters act a little outside their previous norms, which is understandable and adds depth.  They've changed in twenty years. (All fair deviations, with the exception of the Death Eaters naming a holiday Voldemort Day.  It would be the Dark Lord's Day if anything.  Avoiding his name is a massive plot point.)

What's unacceptable is the blatant disregard of the HP universe's rules.  Namely, that one can't change time.  Harry and co. never change time with the time turner--they're fulfilling their predestined roles.  E.g. Harry sees himself cast the Patronus charm in the present without realizing it was himself, and then he returns to the past to cast it.  The timeline is fixed.  In The Cursed Child, going back in time suddenly has the power affect the present adversely in a sort Back to the Future bit of wackiness.

That being said, the children are entertaining and their struggle to cope with their families' legacy is  engaging.  The time travel plot just felt like a lazy way to forced beloved dead characters into the mix.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_97?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=97&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is absolute garbage that should never have carried the Harry Potter name. Stick with Pottermore, Rowling. And Jack Thorne, just stay to your own material. At least The Golden Compass, while I like it okay, is already written bland enough to not tarnish anything too much.

This issue with this screen play is that it totally rips apart the story of Harry Potter and will make you question the entire series. As an avid Harry Potter fan I spent my childhood reading and rereading the stories, delving into the detailed world that is Harry Potter with its imagery and developed characters. None of the characters in here felt right. (SPOILER) Ginny was subdued, Harry was an Arse, Ron sounded like he might belong in St. Mungos, Hermione sounded old, bitter and unpowerful, and Draco was the only original character I actually liked which is against everything in me that is Griffindor.

Wish that I would not have read, JK Rowling should have left the series as the perfection it was and not sold out.

Just pretend it doesn't exist. Or rent it so it won't have the honor of joining your shelf.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016","I'm returning it and pretending I never read it in the first place.

The problem isn't that it's a script instead of a novel. The problem isn't that we aren't seeing the visuals when we read it by itself.

The problem is the story. It didn't make any sense! It didn't add to the other books, it only tried to mess with things that didn't need to be messed with.

HEY SPOILERS ARE COMING. DON'T READ PAST THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT THINGS SPOILED.

Things that really bothered me:

- Time turners. Awful, just awful. We didn't need those back. They were weak in the 3rd book, so I was glad they were destroyed. It's like they focused on the joke people make where ""since they had time turners, why didn't they just get rid of Voldemort as a child"" or other similar stuff, and turned it into a big part of this story. Plus time travel is always super messy. Especially when they had three timelines going on by the end.

- Voldemort having a child. HA. This whole story had me rolling my eyes, but that was just the worst and most ridiculous part for me. He wouldn't want a child and he wouldn't have wanted to sleep with anyone. He didn't care for anyone but himself, that was already made quite clear.

- So many people were missing. Where was George, Teddy, Hugo (Ron and Hermione's son), Neville, Luna, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, plus Lily, Rose, and James are barley in it. I'm sure there are more that are missing.

- None of them felt like the characters that we know and love. Ron is more of an idiot. I don't like him all that much in the other books, but I can tolerate him. What little roles he has in this is dumb. Especially that he was drunk at their wedding? There's no way. Hermione seemed dumbed down and simplified. If she had something as important as the last surviving time turner, she would've hidden it better, not to mention it probably wouldn't be in her office. And Harry. Everything about him seemed wrong. I know that he's going to be different than we last saw him, but this Harry seems like a different person. I hate what he said to Albus. I don't believe he ever would actually say that to his son. Oh and you know who else was different? The woman who pushes the trolley with treats on the Hogwarts Express. That whole scene was ridiculous.

- They brought back Cedric just to drag him through the mud! What was the point? Also, he wouldn't have become a death eater just from the events they made up.

- Why make Harry watch his parents die? That's just cruel!

- Also, it's very jumpy. It's annoying how fast they breeze through the first 3 years for Albus at school. That would've been the most interesting thing to read about in my opinion.

Overall, I hated it. I will continue reading better fanfiction created by teenagers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I haven't been this disappointed in a book probably ever. Harry Potter, like many readers, has been a constant comfort and escape for me ever since I started reading when I was about nine. It was the series that gave me confidence, the urge to read, and a connection with my grandmother who passed away in 2008 almost a year after the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out.

I was excited about the idea of the Cursed Child play because that meant we would have more stories with the characters I grew up with, even if there was a almost no chance I'd ever see the play. My excitement and anticipation skyrocketed when I heard they were going to be publishing the script. I was a bit bummed about the format, hoping that maybe J.K. Rowling would write the story in novel form, and I was bummed when we found out that Rowling wouldn't be writing it. But I was still optimistic. Queen Rowling wouldn't put her stamp of approval on something that she didn't 100% believe was ready for publication.

Unfortunately, as you could probably tell by the rating this script/book did not live up to almost any of my expectations. Because I don't really know where to start, I am just going to list out my pros and cons of the story. THERE WILL BE SPOILERS AFTER THIS.

PROS:
I absolutely loved that Albus Severus Potter was sorted into Slytherin house. Having positive examples of Slytherin students is something I feel like was missing in the original books. We had a few adults like Narcissa Malfoy and Slughorn who both definitely redeemed themselves  but I always wanted a student  that readers who identified Slytherin had to look up to or admire. I wish there was a example of a Hufflepuff, because there's even few known Hufflepuff characters that have their own moments and personalities. I feel like both Slytherin and Hufflepuff get shafted in the original series. Unfortunately Hufflepuff doesn't get much of a mention in this story either but I do think Albus being a Slytherin is a step into the right direction.

I liked what we saw of how Ron grew into being a father, husband, and uncle. He still had his same Ron personality of thinking about food, being over protective, and being down right hilarious but he also did a lot of ""dad-jokes"" and had pretty much been a walking step-by-step instruction on how to embarrass your kids. It was great. I liked how affectionate he was with Hermione, and how he announced that he wanted to re-do his vows with her. She was the same kind of stern but melty Hermione around him. I love them together. I am happy they stayed together. After Rowling's bomb (which I do not, and will not, ever agree with) that she doesn't think they should have been together in the end I was worried she would have them end up divorced or something by the end of the play. Thank God that didn't happen.

This one is a weird PRO. But I liked that Amos Diggory was a complete jerk. It felt very familiar, hating the entitled snark that was Amos. I had this real hatred for him when I read Goblet of Fire for the first time. Of course, I sympathized with him at the end of the book when Cedric dies, but I still did not like him one bit. Now knowing the end of the story I wonder if him going to the Potter's residence was of his own choice, or if Delphi cursed him somehow or even just convinced him. But still, Amos being  a complete jerk at least felt familiar.

I did enjoy Harry's conversations with painting Dumbledore. I don't know too much about how the talking to painting things really work. I always assumed that when a witch or wizard gets painted that version of themselves is what stays immortal so anything the actual person learns or experiences doesn't have any effect on the painting. So because I don't know when Dumbledore was painting I am not sure how much closure Harry really got. But I am happy he got something, because he really let out some intense feelings towards painting Dumbledore. Things he didn't get to say in King's Cross because of the shock of being killed and him still being a boy missing his mentor and friend.

I liked Draco's relationship with his son. He really loves his son and it shows. Lucius Malfoy was never a great father. He was abusive and manipulative and it shows that Draco wants to do better towards Scorpius. I really feel like Draco redeemed himself in this book. He still bickered with the trio, but it was (most of the time) more friendly than angry. You could see a forming of an alliance, or even a friendship.

I also really liked Albus and Scorpius's friendship. I liked that their outcast personalities drew them together and that Albus didn't judge Scorpius about the rumors about him. It reminded me of when Harry didn't judge Ron because of the way his family was perceived by Draco. Albus at times reminded me a lot of a younger Harry. However, they are obviously in love from their dialogue and the way they act around each other. Plus other characters perspectives. I feel like the writers wanted to bait the fans that would have liked seeing a LGBT+ couple in HP but they didn't want to take that last step and make it official. Ridiculous.

When Harry transforms into Voldemort, although it was a awkward scene (more in that in my cons), I like that he completely sucked at acting like an evil Dark Lord. It reminded me of when the trio break into the Ministry of Magic in Deathly Hallows and they suck at pretending to be someone they're not. It had me laughing.

The scene after Harry witnesses his parent's death, when Hagrid walks into the house and finds Lily and James dead. When he talk to Harry and picks him up. More on Hagrid later, but he's one of my top five favorite characters and I am so happy to see that moment with Hagrid and Harry. I know we get a piece of it in Deathly Hallows, and maybe it's because this was a new perspective but I definitely had tears in that moment. However, wasn't Sirius already there with his motorcycle when Hagrid shows up? In HPatCC Hagrid enters an empty house.

CONS:
We jump between small moments for about three years at the Potter's time at King's Cross Station every September 1 we see Albus go from this innocent but nervous kid to a complete jerk who is an ass to Harry. Because of the fact that we don't see why he becomes so angry and why he hates Hogwarts so  much and it makes him seem angry and irrational for no reason. Honestly it's kind of draining an gets a bit annoying at times. If some sort of specific incidents were referenced or played out showing Albus being picked on by his fellow classmates maybe it would make more sense. Scorpius, who has a stupid rumor over his head and has a real reason to hate his classmates seems to love Hogwarts. He loves to learn and he loves being able to be with his best friend.

Talking about the rumor, damn it was dumb. They wanted the reader to know that there was a chance someone would shack up with Voldemort and have a kid and they tried making us believe that the kid was Scorpius. Which didn't work because like Scorpius says, he looks just like his father Draco. Plus, why would going back in time and having Voldemort's son be Draco and Astoria's decision after not being able to have children? Voldemort tortured and royally screwed up the Malfoy family (who, of course kind of did it to themselves - but still) so why would Draco have his wife go and have sex with the man who he probably really hates? It just seemed to make zero sense as a rumor.

The trolley witch, why? Really - why? It made no sense. Why did she need to turn into a spiky  monster thing. Why was that pointless part in there?

I didn't like that Rose was barely a character in the story. I thought she was going to be the girl for their trio, so when it turned out not to be the case I was really bummed. Especially when thinking about the play itself. They made the bold and awesome move to have two women of color play Hermione and Rose and they are barely in the story. I understand Hermione, because the story is about the children more than the parents. But Rose seemed like a cool character. She reminded me so much of Hermione in so many ways but at the same time she had the same judgment (when Albus and Rose meet Scorpius for the first time) sometimes a young Ron carried with him. Why have all the drama and news about having two beautiful (and from what I hear - amazing actresses) women of color be characters that many people for many years thought of as white characters to not use them? I pictured all these little girls and boys who had darker skin going to see the play and seeing Rose as this bad-ass witch and relate. But she wasn't in enough to make enough of an impression which is a real bummer. Now knowing how long they are in the story it feels more like a publicity stunt.

I know that the story mostly focuses on Albus and Scorpius, but I would have liked to see more of the other Potter and Granger-Weasley children. It also would have been nice to see more of Ginny's feisty side and Harry's funny endearing side. Everyone seems to be really awful to Harry in this book, and it made me feel for him. For a moment I honestly thought he was going to die in the end to save his son because of how awful everyone was being to him.

All the time travel seemed pointless because in the end, nothing was changed when it came to timelines. So it seemed like a complete waste of time. I am not against time travel, if it is done right I can really get into it. I loved it in Prisoner of Azkaban. The only time the time travel seemed to really matter was the very last time, and even then I could have lived without it because of how absolutely ridiculous it was. I also don't like that we see Severus Snape. He tells Scorpius to tell Albus that he is proud that Albus has 'Severus' as his middle name but it seemed completely out of place. Maybe because I still think it's absolutely ridiculous that Harry named his kid after a man who tormented him and his friends for years because Harry looked like his dad and because Snape couldn't get with Lily. But that's a little off topic. It just seemed out of Snape's character. Because that version of Snape that feels like he failed Lily on keeping Harry safe doesn't exist, and I don't think it ever would exist. I am not a fan of Snape as a person. He's an amazingly fascinating character but as a person I hate him so much. So for him to have any redemption just made me roll my eyes. It seemed fake and too cheesy for me. Also: because in this time line Ron and Hermione aren't together she is a grumpy old spinster? I don't understand. Hermione is a brave, smart, dependent woman without Ron. I think he writers were trying to parallel her to McGonagall but the problem with that is the writer doesn't know the character well enough so it came off like without Ron, Hermione would never fully be happy with her life. And although I love them together, I think they would both be fine without each other. I just think they're stronger together.

Harry had a bad childhood. He was starved and neglected. I know we don't see Harry as a toddler almost at all with the Dursley's but I assume he was never shown any real love which is something every child needs and deserves to grow up healthy. The fact that Harry went though that and still had such an open heart to Ron, Hermione, the professors at Hogwarts, and the Weasley family is some sort of magic in its own right. Because of this, having Harry tell Albus that he wishes Albus was never his son after Albus says he wishes Harry wasn't his father seemed wrong. Even in the heat of the moment. I know Harry has had a short temper in the past during stressful times. I know he regretted it the moment he said it. But I still don't think it's something Harry would say to any of his kids.

No Neville really pissed me off. Neville killed Nagini! He was the final piece into saving the wizarding world. And all we get is a few references? And no Teddy Lupin! I wanted to know the kind of person he would be. I wanted to see parts of my favorite Marauder shine through his kid. I wanted him to have cool colored hair and a mischievous grin like his mom. No future Hagrid mentioning at all. What the actual crap is that? I may be a bit biased about Hagrid, but it's more than that. If Hagrid saw that Albus was having troubles he would have without a doubt taken Albus under his wing and made sure he was loved. Does that mean he's dead? (Nope I am never ever accepting that. Nope) Because if not then I am a little relieved, but mostly upset he was forgotten about. But sure, let's have a scene with the random Trolley Witch and annoying extra time travel scenes that pretty much lead nowhere. That makes total sense.

How did Scorpius, Delphi, and Albus brew a Polyjuice Potion so quickly? It takes a month to successfully brew a Polyjuice potion. How did they expect to do it at the end of the story while waiting for Voldemort? Hermione you're literally standing right there, you brewed the potion when you were eleven years old. YOU KNOW it takes a month. It's not an option. The group comes to the conclusion it isn't an option because you need a bit of someone to use the potion to transform into another witch or wizard. But no one mentions it also takes a whole month!

How can Albus and Scorpius peak into the house and see Lily and baby Harry when the house is protected by a Fidelius charm? It makes no sense.  Also - right after that scene when they get the idea to write a message (and destroy Harry's last childhood possession. Good job Albus) on Harry's baby blanket, why do we skip the cool and probably hilarious scene of the boys sneaking into the house to steal the blanket from baby Harry? How did they get the blanket without being caught and then have the time to write the message and slip the blanket back into its rightful spot?

The fact that Delphi was Voldemort and Bellatrix's love child is absolutely absurd. Even if Voldemort would have the urge to have sex with anyone (which, I honestly don't think he would. Especially after he lost his pretty boy body/face and turned into a white gross red eyed snake man) why the hell would anyone have sex with a white gross red eyed snake man?! I knew Bellatrix was insane, but really? Also - wouldn't someone notice that Bellatrix was carrying a child? She says she has the baby before the Battle of Hogwarts. So did no one realize that Bellatrix had gotten enormously round during Half Blood Prince? She was standing there the night Dumbledore dies. She was never described as pregnant. Or even when Bellatrix was torturing Hermione in Dealthy Hallows? Nothing makes sense.

On the awkward scene with Harry transforming into Voldemort. Is that a thing? Can you transform witches and wizards into other witches and wizards? Wouldn't everyone do that instead of making Polyjuice Potion and having to wait a whole month? It seemed very convenient.

It seemed fairly easy to detain Delphi, even after she realized Harry wasn't the greatest actor in the world and he wasn't Voldemort.  There were a few quick spells back and forth and the Hermione [as always] jumps in like a BAMF and ties her up with a brachiabindo binding spell. She didn't seem like much of a real threat.

Why exactly did Harry have to stick around and watch his parents die exactly? Hasn't he been through enough crappy situations? It's bad enough he remembers pieces of it as a child, does he have to see the whole thing? It seemed unnecessary.

Harry is scared of pigeons? It's so random. Maybe I'm just nitpicking now because I'm wound up and angry. But it seems so annoyingly outrageous.

Seriously this book reads like the authors scrolled down fanfiction.net, wrote down plot points other people did that they liked and then published the first draft. It reads like a cheesy not well thought out Disney channel show episode.

Not plot point cons:
The fact that it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling showed in the writing. It didn't have the same writing style, which makes sense because everyone has their own style but the problem is I don't think Jack Thorne is that great of a dialogue writer from what we were given. And since scripts are mostly dialogue it wasn't a great experience. The dialogue was stiff and unnatural. No one really talked like how actual people talk. I am hoping that the actors maybe change the words around to make it seem less fake? If not I can't imagine how awkward it is to watch on the stage. Even the way the setting was set up in between scenes, the way the words were strung together read awkwardly. It felt like a really bad fanfiction. I don't read much fanfiction, especially not Harry Potter fanfiction but the ones I have read seemed better than what was given us in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I am just surprised and deeply disappointed that J.K. Rowling let this get published without making sure it all made sense and that the writing was polished. This will not ever be cannon for me. I don't think I will be forgetting the story any time soon, but I am treating it fully as fanfiction.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling just trashed her legacy. She deviated from the core of her characters. You'll find yourself thinking ""She/he would never have said that."" or ""He/she would never have done that!"" It just doesn't track with the characters we knew so well. Fans of the books will be very disappointed in the script. Firstly, it's not actually a novel (duh) and it doesn't read like one (also duh). Many will blame the format for the departure from her past quality and while it clearly didn't do Rowling et. al. any favors, this reads like fan-fiction. Start to finish. The new characters, the changes to old characters, the plot, the concept - all of them scream ""fan-fiction"" and not even good fan-fiction. The key points of the story just don't fit the universe. It's uncomfortable to read this if you're deep into the original stories. You'll struggle to fit the actions of characters into what you know of them. So much of the plot feels like a retread of old material and not just flashbacks but the themes. This didn't add anything new to the Harry Potter universe. At least, nothing that we couldn't have lived without.

There are a few brief moments that feel like the wizarding world we all know and love but sadly, they are few and far between.

Fans of Harry Potter do owe it to themselves to read the story but I strongly recommend that you lock this tale far far away from your memory of the 7 books.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_159?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=159&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I loved the books. This? I'm pissed about.

15 bucks for the kindle version down the drain.

I was able to get into it despite it being still just the literal script. But that stripped the entire world from it. The actual books had the nuance of the day to day life of a schoolkid. The snowball fights. The taste of butterbeer.

I'm sure this gets more as an actual play, because the play lets the actors bring the characters to life. But when reading it, I need the ""stage"" to be the extra words describing the scene. This felt like an 'artistic' minimalist play of one actor up there just delivering the lines and expecting us to appreciate that. I didn't. Maybe that's on me, who knows.

The characters also didn't feel like themselves. There's some lines from Harry I just can't picture him saying, despite him being 40 now. And there's some 'youthful adventurous' scenes, one specifically on the Hogwarts train, that just seems absolutely silly.

I also agree that it feels more like a fanfic. The returning characters seem more written with the surface personalities, not with the nuanced other personality traits you sensed under the surface with a whole book.

The bare bones maybe gives me hope. Maybe if a legitimate book is written around this it wouldn't be bad. And maybe with the actors bringing the lines to life, the play may be great. But this? Not worth the money at all.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is not a official continuation of the story we know (I don't care if Joe tells me to my face that it is), and I wish Joe had not let her name be dragged into it.  The issues are as follows:

-The number of plot holes is staggering. Worse than almost any fanfic I've ever read.
-All the character building in the original books has been promptly scraped.
-The laziest, and most cliche plot device that exists in media.
-The wasted potential! This is what hurt the most. The more basic and reasonable plot points could have build into such an amazing story.

If you want to know what happens I will summarize to the best of my abilities.

So Albus and Scorpius become friends on the train and both end up in Slytherin (good stuff in my opinion) Amos Diggory calls on Harry and asks him to go back in time and save Cedric. Harry says no. Albus overhears and decided he and his new friend should embark on this nonsensical quest for someone they don't know to save the other person they heard of maybe once, with no motivation of their own. In short they mess up time in may ways many times to the point where Voldemort had killed Harry in the 2nd Wizard war and Albus doesn't exist. After this being fixed through silly means it turns out that Voldemort had a daughter with Bellatrix and she had orchestrated this elaborate scheme to bring Voldemort back. She tried to confront Voldemort only to find that it is Harry in disguise and they fight, and she actually gets the upper hand on him ( a trained Auror) before, once again, Harry has to be saved by his friends. Anyways they beat her and imprison her.

I was part of the Harry Potter generation to the fullest, reading and writing theories, attending midnight releases, solving the puzzles on Jo's website, reading the new books in one sitting.  I have enjoyed the supplementary material, hoped to visit the theme park, looked forward to the Fantastic Beasts films.  This play is the one and only aspect of the Harry Potter franchise that has been a major disappointment to me.

First, I want to address the format.  Many complaints are being directed at the script format being difficult to read.  This does not bother me.  This story was intended as a play and I am grateful that the script was made available to the public.  It is meant to be brought to life on the stage rather than in the reader's mind, and there are inherent limitations that come with that.

However, when it came to the story, I was not impressed.  Generally, I felt that it read like fanfiction, and not even the best fanfiction. While I enjoyed the little nostalgic nods placed throughout the story, I found that the characters I love were lost, the plot was lacking and even problematic, and Rowling's well thought-out version of time travel was ruined. I could say a lot more but I want to avoid specifics/spoilers, so suffice it to say that I will *not* be considering this play a part of the Harry Potter canon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The story here, if there is one, is disjoined and choppy with glaring omissions and convenient scene changes which seem to be used not to move the story along, but rather used as a device to get the characters out of an untenable situation.

Though some interesting ideas were portrayed, I do not feel they were well developed and it fails to surprise the way the other books did. The plot is an overly used and worn out version we have seen a dozen times in other stories and Harry deserved better.

As if Rose being depicted as a condescending, egotistical, bulling snob and then being completely written out, Hermione's dependence upon marriage to Ron for her adult success and decency, referring to ""her sins"" stereo-typically sexist harking back to Eve's original sin, Delphi being the evil witch the men have to save the world from, wasn't bad enough, they didn't even redeem the ending to reflect the obvious consequences of the hero's hate being their own self-fulfilling downfall.  It is the hero's blindness (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco) that causes the inevitable war.  They are blinded by hate.  THEY lacked empathy and mercy at the end of this story.  They are turned into the REAL antagonists.  The writers had the opportunity to allow Delphi to see Voldemort, giving him the love he needed to break the curse (which was loneliness and the absence of love) that made him cold in the first place.  Delphi's crime was that she wanted to see her father and make him proud?  What kind of hero/role-model is Harry Potter who cannot empathize with that?  This book has turned the Harry Potter hero's, once decent role-models, capable of recognizing their mistakes and the underlying reasons for bad deeds in others, into stagnate, rigidly judgmental, hypocrites who mirror those they demonize and pat themselves on the back for doing so.  The ending should have reconciled the hero's hatred and allowed them to be dynamic characters.  It is truly nothing more than a great author selling-out and cashing-in on her big success.

Let me start off by saying I love Harry Potter. Like, seriously, I LOVE Harry Potter with a passion. I've read all the books multiple times, frequently watch the movies, and have made the pilgrimage to Universal Orlando. But even I'm not ""blinded by love"" enough to ignore the fact that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was really, truly awful.

I just finished reading it and honestly, it just read like badly thought out fan fiction to me. They completely disregarded the rules of magic regarding time turners, I thought the characterizations of a lot of the characters were completely off (there was nothing Harry wanted more in life than to have a family. Don't tell me he would have been a screw up dad.), and the whole thing about Harry being able to speak parseltongue again made absolutely no sense. He was only able to speak parseltongue because of the horcrux living within him--when the horcrux died, that ability died with it.

And in all honesty, the plot just seemed plain lazy. ""Oh yeah, let's just throw some alternate universes at them and give the Dark Lord a daughter! That'll work! And doesn't contradict ANYTHING in the original series!"" I didn't have high hopes coming into this, but it just seems like they didn't even try to come up with a creative story. I can't tell you how utterly disgusted I am with all of this. I mean, really? Voldemort and Bellatrix having a daughter? That's bad fan fiction at it's finest.

The one saving grace of the script was Scorpius. He was a fun character to read about, and his character had some of the spark that the original books had, but even he's not enough to save the script. At the end of the day, one decent character can't save a terrible plot. I honestly wish they'd never put this out. The series had a good ending, we didn't need this to come along and muck everything up. The fans were happy (for the most part) with how the series originally ended. Who's gonna be happy with Harry being a screw up dad, a cheap Voldemort knock off plot, and contradictions galore? I know I'm not.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The following are my main problems:

SPOILERS AHEAD:

1.  Why JKR allowed anyone but herself to write a story using her characters is a huge mystery to me.  It's obvious from the get-go that she did not write the story because the characters speak and behave NOTHING like themselves.  Moreover, the writing is, at best, mediocre.  Even allowing for the skills and talents of actors and the emotion with which they might imbue the dialogue, I can't imagine it would come out sounding anything but boring.  It simply has no **heart**.

2.  Can anyone really envision Voldemort having sex--like, *ever*?  Really?  I don't think I've ever read a more asexual character, anywhere.  So it was basically impossible for me to suspend disbelief to accept that he had a love child with Bellatrix.  Nope.  Sorry.  Never would have happened (despite that *she* surely would have wished it had).  Thus, since I couldn't accept the premise on which the entire story is based, the whole thing just didn't work for me.  At all.

3.  Twenty-plus years of marraige, and Ron and Hermoine still seem like the worst-matched couple, ever.  I love them both, but living their day-to-day lives under the same roof, raising a family...?  I still can't envision it.

4.  Hermoine--Minister of Magic...?  Makes me sad for her--like she's never learned to loosen up at all, is still trying to control everything around her (and why? What's she so afraid will happen?).  Also, it seems like a terrible waste of magical talent; I mean, why take the ""best student of the year"" and turn her into an adminstrator who, doubtless, spends most of her time in meetings, organizing stuff, and making decisions that other people will execute.  As I said, it makes me sad--and, maybe, a little disgusted.

I wish I could think of at least one thing I liked about the play, but I'm very sorry to say that I can't.  I have to chalk it up to a waste of time and money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

So Many Plot-Holes It's Ridiculous.  PLEASE just wait for it to be in the library!","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2016","WARNING:  SPOILERS!!!!
Pros:
- Albus becomes a Slytherin, and how Harry is perfectly fine with that. It erases the stereotype of  'all good main characters get to be Gryffindors'.

- Scorpious is not the antagonist or a hated character.  It makes me so happy that the son of Draco is friends with Harry's son.  Even though a lot of the school seems to think that he's a son of Voldemort, we get to see who he really is.

- We got to see Severus Snape again.  After we found out that Severus was a good guy, and actually had a soft side, he dies.  We never really get a chance to learn who he really is.  I'm really happy that we got a chance to see him again in this series.  My favorite part of this book was when Scorpios tells Snape about his love for Lily and how Harry named his child after Snape. I liked how he told him how he was proud that he carries his name.

- I also liked how we got to see what would have happened if Voldemort had won. I'm sure we have all wondered at least once what would have happened. I thought it was cool to see that alternate reality.

Cons:
- The relationship between Albus and Harry... All Harry wanted growing up was a father, but he's not a father figure for Albus. Albus wishes Harry was not his father and Harry wishes that Albus was not his son... it was just so out of character and I'm not sure where the anger is coming from.

- The whole Time-Turner plot... there was a reason that Rowling destroyed all of the Time-Turners in the fifth book.  And now there are two Time-Turners?  Oh wait... but noo... One of them is fake.  And our favorite, super-high-IQ, GREATEST WITCH OF THE AGE Hermione Granger decides to hide it in a LIBRARY.  Who would have guessed??  And when Scorpious and Albus go back and try to save Cedric... THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT ROLE HE PLAYED. In the end of the '19 Years Later' They ask why everyone is staring and Ron says, ""Because I'm famous."" This makes me think that they don't really know what happened during and before the battle of Hogwarts.

- How on earth did Ron end up running the joke shop?  What happened to George?  Ron became an Auror.  George was literally my favorite character, and probably the favorite character of a lot of other people, and suddenly the book decides: 'oh.  Well, we don't really need George Weasley for the plot, so we can just pretend he doesn't exist.'  His brother died.  Why would they not carry on the beautiful and tragically sad legacy of Fred and George Weasley?

- Rose is a bit of a bully 'Al. We need to concentrate.  On who we choose to be friends with.'... 'On the contrary, it's exciting.  I'm a Granger-Weasley, you're a Potter--everyone will want to be friends with us, we've got the pick of anyone we want.'...'We rate them all and then we make a decision.'  I get that the authors wanted her to  be a sort of Hermione-like character, but this is a little overboard.

- The rumor about Scorpious being the son of Voldemort.  It didn't really make sense to me because it didn't change the plot. I have no idea why it was mentioned. Just so that he was bullied? I'm not sure it was needed.

- The whole thing with Bellatrix being pregnant with Voldemort's child.  Not once did the book mention anything about her being pregnant or looking pregnant.  Then, she dies.  When did she give birth to Delphi?  Also wasn't she too old?  She must have been around seventy years old.  Tom Riddle's diary was dated to fifty years before Harry was at Hogwarts, and Voldemort and Bellatrix were in the same year.  Before the battle of Hogwarts, Harry was seventeen.  Bellatrix was sixty-seven years old.

- Voldemort could not love because he was conceived by a love potion, and also he was so gone from all of the Horcruxes.  If he wanted an heir, he could have just preserved a part of him in a Horcrux, and then brought himself back to life again.  He already did it once, why not do it again?

- Trolly Lady... what... So Albus and Scorpious climb on top of the Hogwarts Express..., and the old Trolley Lady appears there, pushing her trolley (how on earth did she get the trolley up there?!)  and becomes a monster or something.  Suddenly, she says that James and Sirius tried to escape, and then Fred and George, and now them.  But none of the others escaped.  Fred and George seem to be considerably more intelligent than the main characters, but the main characters escape anyway... I get the Percy Jackson vibe; old ladies turning into monsters.  What's with the exploding pumpkin pasty thing, anyway?  Why would an old lady need a grenade sweet?  Why is she allowed to work on a train that is stuffed with children if she is a senile psychopath?

- The whole Delphi thing.  I read that and all these characters from Percy Jackson started coming to mind...She had an augurey tattoo on her arm, and she was obsessed with a prophecy.  I was suspicious of her from the beginning.  And also... how on earth did she appear in the room?  She's just randomly on the staircase.  Then, when Albus and Scorpious go back in time to bring a random boy back to life, she goes right along and is all like: 'okay, let's do it!'  These main characters are teenage boys, which already means that their common sense level is kind of low.  She decides to go right along and trust them with this endeavor?  It doesn't make any sense.

- Scorpious's mother's death was supposed to be an emotional event, but I didn't care much about the mother, mostly because she had never been mentioned in the book.

- Amos Diggory suddenly becomes lost in the past and is releasing all of this pent up anger about his dead son.  ""They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them. ""  That is a quote from the Fourth book after Harry returned from the Maze.  Amos was a reasonable man, even after his son's death.  It doesn't make sense that nineteen years later he would suddenly become so angry.  It wasn't clear as to whether he was confunded or imperiosed or something, because at the beginning he says Delphi is his niece, but at the end, he says he had no niece.

-  The whole thing about Harry's scar hurting doesn't make any sense.  Harry's scar originally hurt because Voldemort was feeling some sort of strong emotion, or was somewhere near.  It doesn't make sense that he would feel it because VOLDEMORT IS DEAD. It was a hard life but we did it. And then his scar is hurting again and we all get the impression that he is alive. Why is his scar connected to Delphi?  Harry was connected to Voldemort because part of Voldemort's soul went into Harry.  Harry's soul couldn't have been passed down to Delphi, or Harry would have felt his scar hurting long before.

- The thing about Delphi being obsessed with a prophecy... Again... Percy Jackson, and also, how wouldn't harry have heard of this before if it obviously concerned him?  It would have been next to the first prophecy ball (neither shall live while the other survives) because it was all in alphabetical order, and if it was about Harry, it would have been right there.  Also, weren't all the prophecies in that section destroyed?  If so, then why does Delphi know about this?  She was born so many years later.

-  Harry starts getting these strange prophetic dreams.  (Again, like Percy Jackson)  But before it was just seeing out of Voldemort's eyes... feeling the emotions that he was feeling.  And now... What exactly is he dreaming about?

- When Delphi randomly whips out this polyjuice potion, it immediately set off a bunch of alarms in my head.  Who carries around bottles of Polyjuice potion?  It takes a month to make.  A MONTH.  And she randomly has it.  Also, how did she get the hairs of Ron, Harry, and Hermione?  As far as we know, nobody has heard of her before, except for Amos, who might have been confunded, which means that she probably hasn't met any of them, other than Harry.  (She was on the staircase the night that Amos came to visit.)

- When Albus, Scorpious, and Delphi infiltrate the Ministry as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Albus(Ron) blocks the door to Hermione's office, saying that he might have left a Stinkbomb there.  Hermione never questioned Ron about it later.  Why didn't they get caught?

- How did Delphi know all of these spells?  She probably bewitched Amos, and she definitely used spells to subdue Albus and Scorpious but she never went to a magic school or Hogwarts.

- When Albus and Scorpious go back in time for the first time, Hermione is some sort of Snape professor.  How did she become so bitter?  I know that she was in love with Ron, but, knowing Hermione, she would probably rationally set all of her emotions straight and find someone else.

- The second time, they say that Albus went down the sink.  A sink.  How on earth did he disappear down the sink?  Sink drains are pretty small as far as I can remember.

- When Albus and Scorpious go back in time to the night that Harry got his scar, they figure out that they can send a message to Harry through some sort of magical...potion... chemical reaction.  How did they find the time to go into the house, unwrap baby Harry, find whatever dust they needed, write the message, and wrap it back around baby Harry?  How did they do it unnoticed?  And even then, how did Harry not notice the words on the blanket before?  From the other times they went back in time, we know that the two times aren't parallelly existing.  I'm sure that Harry would have noticed strange holes that looked like numbers burned into his precious baby blanket.  And when they found out that they could make a chemical reaction... It wouldn't work because the love potion wasn't on the blanket when Harry was a baby.

- Delphi destroys the time turner.  But she seems to do it with physical force.  'She crushes the Time-Turner.  It explodes in a thousand pieces.'  How could something so valuable be destroyed but someone's hand?  It makes no sense.

- When Harry gets transformed into Voldemort, his disguise starts to wear off.  Firstly, his transformation was not caused by a Polyjuice potion, so it wouldn't wear off like a potion.  Secondly, the only reason that Harry, Ron, and Hermione's disguises disappeared in the seventh book was because of the waterfall.  So why did Harry's disguise disappear?

- At the end, Harry and Albus have this bonding moment and talk about their fears.  Harry says he's afraid of darkness, which, in a way makes sense, since he had major issues with Dark Wizards and whatnot, but PIGEONS?!  Seriously?  If this was supposed to be a joke for younger children, okay, fine, it might be slightly humorous, but in reality... Not once was this mentioned in the previous series, and Harry had to have discovered his fear of pigeons earlier.  For people who are older, the joke was completely unnecessary and made no sense.

-  TEDDY LUPIN?!!  Where are you???  This one really struck me hard.  All of the hardships that Nymphadora Tonks and Lupin went through, and they don't mention anything about their legacy?  They finally admit their feelings for each other.  They get married.  A child is born.  They die to defeat the Dark Wizard.  They die for the protection of their son.  When Lupin sees Harry while he has the resurrection stone, he says ""I am sorry too... Sorry I will never know him [Teddy]... but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand.""  Well, from what the book tells us, Teddy never did know why his parents died.  Teddy didn't exist.

Overall, this book seems to ba a fanfiction book that has J.K. Rowling's name on it. Maybe she was in it for the money? I have been reading Harry Potter for forever and I am absolutely obsessed with the series. But this book isn't the complex, well thought-out book we are used to seeing.  There are so many little plot holes that might have been smoothed out if Rowling actually wrote the book, or even if it was in book form.  I did enjoy some parts of the book, and I must admit I was super excited when I saw its cover in Barnes and Nobles, but I was sadly disappointed.  I hope that the play form is different, and maybe it can be enjoyed by more people.  The book is a new style, for sure, but the Harry Potter series just aren't supposed to be written in play form.  The book ended up being a little flat.  If J.K. Rowling wanted to tie up the Harry Potter series with something that was memorable in a good way, this wasn't the best way to do it.  I still don't consider this book as part of a series, and I'm praying with all my heart that Rowling does something with her talent and creates some sort of sequel that doesn't have so many plot holes.  I'm just glad that the original series is something timeless.

Just a note:  This book isn't worth buying if you haven't bought it already.  If you want to read it, I would recommend waiting for it to come out in a library.  I spent twenty-two dollars on the book, and now I wish I had just waited.

I get that there are new characters and I am asked to get to know and love them from a bare-bones script whereas I spent years learning and loving the original characters.  What I DON'T get is why almost every one is so damn unlikable. Albus is as annoying as Harry circa Order of the Phoenix with his angst. Ron--on paper--is a caricature of his former self: his corniness is highlighted in a less than enduring way, his mediocrity more glaring than ever.  Hermione seems to be an ineffective leader and hardly believable as the head of the magical world. Harry is just--awful, just awful. Draco suddenly became overly emotional and unlike the haughty, cold British boy I loved before. Scorpius is the saving grace and pretty much the only likeable person.

And then there are the glaring plot holes...why is Cedric Diggory only one awful event away from becoming one of the worst people ever? His honor, valor, chivalry, and fairness are what his character was about--so one bad day turns him into a demon for all time? No. Unconvincing. Why--WHY--if the Malfoys had real Time-Turners, wouldn't they have gone back and achieved their plans before? Or if they acquired them after Voldemort's fall, they still could have gone back in time and made Draco a hero--which is befitting of their prideful ways and would have been pretty interesting. The love-child with Bellatrix and Voldemort is just wrong.  Of course we knew Bellatrix was panting after him, but Voldemort seemed to be apart from lust of any kind for a woman. It is just awkward and disgusting. It also seems like Bellatrix would have piped up about such a thing prior to the war, or even any of the Malfoys. It also seems that the baby would have been made into another Horcrux if she was so top secret.

Finally, perhaps the most annoying thing of all to me, is the just plain weirdness of some things. There seems to be a lot more SPOKEN emotion in the play.  In all 7 of the original books, none of the characters say ""I love you"" or anything. Their love is implied and demonstrated in their actions and this somehow makes it more realistic than mushy words, however in this play they are all about the mushy sentiments and it is just out of character for them. And there is this one scene with Albus--who is 14--disguised as Ron with the aid of polyjuice potion is trying to distract Hermione from going inside of her office and is practically making out with her and actually says he wants to have another baby with her. Ew.

I would see the play if I am ever in London, or if it travels to the US, but only to see if it redeems itself somehow in some measure. It will never be right or perfect and I wish I had a time-turner so I can unread this crap and go back to platform 9 3/4 to see a bright-eyed 11 year old Albus off on the train and leave the saga there.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The characters are ridiculous and the writing is oh-so-bad. People were actually hysterical when I read parts out loud to them - ""her spikes particularly spiky"" ? No... really? Regardless of the content... it is some of the worst writing... ever. I've seen middle school students write better. Now, onto content: At least fanfiction understands and respects the original content. This piece breaks tons of pre-established rules set down by the HP series. Polyjuice can be whipped up in an instant? Azkaban lets people out on parole I suppose? The trolley witch is the terminator? Ron is some strange man we've never met before. Harry is the worst father on the planet. Ginny - oh, poor sweet Ginny. She could have been a great athlete but instead she is an utterly depressed housewife-type whose only solace is found in Draco. Yes, apparently Ginny and Draco are best buds because they are constantly having little asides of their own - and really who can blame Ginny with Harry constantly throwing his life story into her face. As for Albus and Scorp, they are obviously in love, complete with strange scenes of doe-eyed longing on moving staircases. I'm fine with that. In fact, I applaud it. I wish the writers had. Instead they turn around and shove down your throat ""NOPE! See, they like these girls who will inevitably rip out their hearts!"" (quite literally in one respect). Bellatrix was pregnant and no one knew... despite having the baby at Malfoy Manor... where... you know, everyone was? Draco didn't know despite living there? Bella, who was obsessed with Voldemort, didn't take out an ad in the Daily Prophet announcing her unbridled joy at such an honor? Please. And these are all just a small sampling of the insane things you will read inside. I'm so disappointed that Rowling put her name on this and as such has helped it enter canon. All trust lost. The rest of this is all just greedy money-making.  Don't be sucked in.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I loved the books and read them at least 5 times each (probably more). I wanted to like this book but it was really hard for me to finish because it was so bad. I used to read the original Harry Potter books nonstop until I finished them. I read the last book for 10 hours straight and that was around 900 pages. It's two weeks after I got this book and I can't even get myself to finish the last 50 pages of this book. It's obviously not written by JK Rowling and the whole story is ridiculous. The rules that JK Rowling set up for going back in time in the Prisoner of Azkaban somehow don't apply in this book. Ron and Harry don't even appear to be the same characters. Ron somehow turned really funny and Harry is a bad dad that doesn't understand his kid. The Harry that I know from the original books would have got to know his kid and his kid wouldn't resent him for no reason. Also, there's NO WAY that Voldemort would have had a kid. He couldn't love and I cant imagine him liking anyone touching him. This book feels like fantasy when the other books felt real. I hope that JKR contributed very little to this because of how poorly it is written. If she contributed even 5% of this storyline, I am very disappointed in how this story of Harry's life and his children's life are going. If JKR wanted to create a play, she should have done a story about the Marauders at Hogwarts or during the first war against Voldemort. She could have even done a story about the Harry's kids at Hogwarts facing other evils but to create a child of Voldemort feels fake and like the story just needed a villain and used almost the same one as all the other books. I am very disappointed. I wish this book had never come out at this point because it puts a damper on the original books. I'm going to live in denial and pretend that this didn't come out and this isn't the future for the Wizarding World. As far as I am concerned, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows concluded the story and Harry's scar never hurt again. All was well and should have stayed well.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Maybe the script doesn't do justice to the presentation of the play on stage, but the story itself was truly awful. It seemed like a poor man's badly developed fanfiction mashup of Back to the Future and Harry Potter, with characters whose personalities were warped and distorted to fit the childish, fast-paced plot. The internally inconsistent logic (Scorpius and Albus are smart enough to give their father a message in the future...but not smart enough to realize the sheer stupidity of changing a significant historic event?) combined with an almost comedic, eye-roll-inducing villain made it clear that this play is written for kids and pre-teens who probably never even read the original books. Releasing a book with ""Harry Potter and the..."" in the title, with JK Rowling's name on the cover gave me certain expectations, none of which were met.

I'm not sure how this play will be presented given the special effects requirements, but maybe those will at least distract from the fact that the plot is nonsensical and definitely not the Harry Potter fans know and love.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My biggest gripe with his book, among many, is I find it incredibly hard to believe that Voldemort would have a child. With the way he treated his followers he could care less about them it said that in the original books. The thought that he would have sex with one of his followers and accidentally have a child with them is too much dumb to absorb.

The original potter 3 and other original characters, are dim-witted and do not reflect the well written characters of JK Rowling.

I hope it is better as a play, because as a book it’s awful. It makes me sad it is apart of the potter-verse and JK Rowling gave her blessing to this junk.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

To put into perspective how much this book ...","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2017","I clearly remember the I discovered Harry Potter. I don’t remember my age, but I do recall the place. My Dad took us to Barnes & Noble in Little Rock, AR. I couldn’t find a book I wanted to read. Seeing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone on a cardboard display, Dad pointed to it. That night, I discovered never-ending magic.

Or so I thought. Let’s be frank, shall we? I pride myself on my ability to remain unbiased when writing a review about a book. Sometimes I’m friends with the author, sometimes I’m asked to cover it, sometimes I choose to. No matter what manner brings this book to me, I’m honest. I will remain the same with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. That said, this book sucks.

To put into perspective how much this book sucks, let me put it this way: I dropped it. The only other book I haven’t finished is Outlander. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on work by Rowling, but it is not a Harry Potter book. Not in the sense that those of us who grew up with it see it, anyways. When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I felt as much excitement as the next fan. After attempting to read it, I chose to leave the series where it ended in Deathly Hollows.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not so much a continuation of the series as it is a fan-fiction. And while there is good fan-fiction out there, this is not an example of it. This book (or screenplay) is a desperate attempt to continue a completed series. Not only does it fail to breathe life back into the friends of our childhood, but it does so with a timeline restrained by rules of the theater.

Even worse, the friendship that blossoms between Albus and Scorpio seems too farfetched. It’s as if the screenwriters sought yet another retelling of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. A retelling that doesn’t do the pair justice, from what others that forced themselves to finish the book have told me. The only thing I find worse than romance in a story is a romance that falls short of its potential.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's Trash.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","Some said a play script isn't supposed to be read on paper, and that the play is fantastic. But the script is also HP canon now, with all these flat characters, cliche dialogue and a contradictory plot. Maybe he actors can cover the issues and make the play enjoyable, but the canon is spoiled anyway.

---- Spoilers below ----

The familiar characters are humiliated.
Harry, who fought Voldemort face-to-face at 16, the Master of Death, an Auror, is now an insecure man who needs to occasionally hold his baby blanket (that's not a metaphor), loses self-control, never fights alone and is afraid of darkness and pigeons. I'd understand PTSD - actually, it'd be pretty interesting - but he's defined as ""an average person struggling to be a parent"", and it's just insulting.
Hermione, the brightest witch of the century and the Minister of Magic, hides a dangerous artifact behind 3 simple riddles. Even using her mom's maiden name would have been a better security measure.
Ron, who tried to pursue his own ambitions despite being in shadow of his brothers and friends, has not only not reached his potential, he is now a shadow of Fred. All his character development is just thrown away.
Almost nothing is left of Ginny's fierce spirit, of Dumbledore's quirks and wisdom, of Snape's ice cold attitude, of Sedric's unshakable goodness. And if you thought Voldemort and Bellatrix were creepy - believe me, it gets worse.

The plot makes no sense.
Time travel is inconsistent. The authors time model is ""whatever lets us fit our fanfics in the canon"". The plot holes are everywhere, and I believe the authors didn't even understand how time works. Seriously, the heroes exclaim ""there's no time"" while holding a timeturner. Harry's scar hurts because Voldemort is about to be brought back - okay, but he's about to be brought back 40 years ago, why would the scar hurt *40 years later in another timeline*?
The villain' plan is so oblique it's surreal; the only explanation why she haven't chosen a reasonable plan is ""it was prophesied to be that way"".

The writing is horrible. Just, bad-fanfic-level horrible.

And all this hot mess is now canon, retroactively spoiling the previous books.
Also, the trolley witch. I can't even.

The story is OK, but it unfolds way too quickly and leaves several questions unanswered. Yeah, I know, it's a play. Even so, many of the characters are not very credible and do not look much like the ones in the (proper) books, even taking into account that time has passed. Ron Weasley is a particularly bad case, a pathetic mixture of Mad Hatter and Mr Bean. It was never my favorite character but here they turned him into the village idiot.

I wasn't expecting much of this book. But I never thought it would be this bad.
The story is ridiculous. There are plot holes on almost every page. The storyline just doesn't seem plausible with the original seven Harry Potter books in mind. It all feels rushed and not well thought through. It isn't fun, it isn't clever, it is not memorable.
The new characters have very little motivation. Everyone has one character identification. Nothing more. They are one-dimensional, they are not likeable. One of them (who is supposed to be liked) is a straight out horrible and shallow person. How are we supposed to like them?
There are a lot of (new and old) characters. I mean in a play we don't get to read what they feel; we just get the dialog. And that works (we have all at least once read a play), but only if we get a lot of the lead characters and only a bit of the supporting ones. Here we get a little bit of everyone and so it is a miracle, that the characters even have one clear trait. They obviously count on the actors to do the job, but as a reader it just doesn't deliver.
Even the ""old"", known characters feel flat. And here we know the characters from amazing books. They just would have needed the right direction. If Harry had just once acted like the original Harry, we would have thought of all his other character traits, even if they are not mentioned. That is how it works if you have a well-established character. But the original trio is astoundingly dull and boring. They don't resemble the source material at all. If they weren't named Harry, Ron and Hermione i wouldn't have recognised them. Ron for example has now the character traits of Fred and George. He is constantly trying out the joke shop gadgets and he is playing the fool. That doesn't feel like Ron at all. We know how these characters should act and when they don't it feels off. Consequently, the whole play feels off.
When I first bought the book I thought J.K. Rowling had actually written this book in cooperation with other authors. But now I feel like she thought of a story, described it in three sentences and other authors made this play out of it.
I understand that it was never intended that we readers would get the whole experience and I knew that when I bought the book. I could forgive the flat characters and the rushed storyline, because it is a play. But I cannot ignore the plot holes and the way they portrayed all the original characters. It feels like bad fanfiction. Someone had an idea for a good story, but neither time to fully think the plot through, nor experience in portraying characters or getting the right pacing.
Conclusion:
I don’t recommend this book to anyone. If you read the original seven books, you will be deeply disappointed. You will get a poorly told story, without getting the chance to care for any of the characters. Don’t destroy your memory of Harry Potter. Stay with what you know. I will try to forget.
And to anyone unfamiliar to the HP universe: you will not be able to follow the story; it relies too much on the source material. So I would suggest to read the Harry Potter books actually written by J.K. Rowling and then never to come back!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_99?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=99&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was very much aware that it's the play script and that didn't bother me. I looked forward to imagining what the stage looked like, the actors gestures, etc. So the format was not a problem for me. What I simply cannot understand, is how ANY self-proclaiming die-hard HP can could possibly like this story. It's a lame fan fiction at BEST! At the very, very best. Why'd you let them do it, Jo, why??? The script is painful to read. Just plain corny and predictable most of the time. The characters are unrecognizable. Seven years of character development flushed down the tube. You mean to tell me that Harry Potter, who was driven to use an unforgivable curse on Amycus Carrow because the latter dared to spit on McGonagall, that this same Harry Potter would speak to her in such a disrespectful way? This woman who was one of the only two mother figures to Harry?? No way! Not especially when his son is in danger. Not to the woman who stood with him on the eve of the Battle of Hogwarts. It seems every single character had turned into a watered down version of themselves when they grew up. We change as we age, true. But our hope is that we do not lose the essence of who we are. It is a terrible tragedy when that happens. And it's exactly what we're present with in this cursed play. Don't even get me started on what they did to Ron. I could write a whole dissertation on that travesty. So many times, I wanted to stop reading this garbage but I was bound by my no-book-left-unread rule. So I ploughed ahead and finished it.

Personally I have lost alot of repect for you as a writer for allowing this travesty to be released as book 9... I waited 19 years for a book that was supposed to be the book to end all books, literally. I have been a follower and lover of the wizarding world of Harry Potter since Day 1... My old paperback  copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone has been read so many times its held together by tape... all 8 of my books are in some form of shabbiness due to the overwhelming amount of times each were lovingly read. I memorized almost every line, able to repeat the books almost from heart. Well yes 90% of my books on my shelves look like this. Harry Potter was and will always be my favorite series. Then this sad excuse for a story dare I say piece of crap shoved between two decieving covers, disguised as a book I was supposed to love just as much landed on my doorstep. I thought JK Rowhling respected her readers more then this. How could she have been so LAZY as too take a s***ty play written by someone else, slap her cover on, and sell it to her adoring and mislead fan base.

It reads like fan fiction by an author that is not that familiar with the Harry Potter series. If this is the way sequels will go, I am not buying any more in this series.

Most of the script reads like fanfiction and is basically a rehash of the original books. There is very little that is original or creative. While the concept  of the plot was briefly interesting, issues were quickly resolved without making use of anything new within the Harry Potter universe. The writing is not complex or layered, possibly because of the screenplay format.  It is also ridiculous and childish writing to have most the main characters married, still in contact with another, and their offspring named after former favorite characters.

Firstly i am a huge HP fan! Grew up with the novels and they made me who i am today! This was, at the very least, a disappointment!  I didn't mind the script form at all, what i did mind is the terrible, awful and ridiculous plot! I had read spoilers online (never done that before for HP) and was completely ""discombobulated"" by them. I was certain it was an elaborate hoax by JK and the keep the secrets campaign to throw off fans! I began reading being absolutely sure the real thing would be different! What an utter disappointment it was! Of all the possibilities a vast magical world provides for an original story, they went with the time travel theme. Urgh. I will not go into details for it will take forever to write, and honestly.  i.  just. cant. anymore. This story is as unoriginal as they come. Relying heavily on already tested material, creating plot hole after plot hole, destroying beloved characters, this is a travesty. And it is killing me. The plot is so farfetched and sloppy, so many mistakes! I did  not even nitpick, if i had i dont think i would have finished it at all. I was looking forward to this more than  words can convey. I spent years of my life invested in this world, these characters, and this was a slap in the face. If i wanted fanfiction i would have read it for free. It would probably be better.

I just don't understand how Rowling could have made such a story like this. She has amazing books, not just from the Harry Potter World. This book is as if a 15 year old girl who was obsessed with the epilogue wrote it all. It's purely fanfiction at the worst level, and I know, I've read some. The characters that we have loved, cried, and laughed at since we first picked up the first book are so different from when they were 17-year-old kids.
I'm very disappointed how it all came out. I really wish someone would obliviate it all from my mind. It doesn't deserve all the hype that it's been getting.

It is a case of someone writing their own fan-fiction, and they were somehow lucky enough to get it published with J.K. Rowling's name attached. While there are some good ideas in the play, they are childishly under-developed. The stage directions try way too hard, the references are overly involved with every detail of the original series, and the characters are clearly derived from the authors'  personal fantasies and wishes, and not from the great character sketches Rowling provided throughout the series.

I read the books multiple times a year, watch the movies frequently and have read a lot of additional articles from pottermore. I had to wait a few days to get this book because of cash flow issues but Now that I have read it I fully regret ever reading this.

while I was looking forward to this and I knew it would be a script from a play not an in depth novel that I am used to; even with expectations being lowered a little to accommodate this being a play, nothing could prepare me for this travesty of a story.

Firstly: time travel is a weak plot line at best. After waiting years for a new story from Jo we get ""what would have happened if Cedric hadn't died"" this was such a let down.

Secondly: Cedric being embarrassed during the triwizard tournament would have been enough to cause someone who we remembered as brave, and selfless, to become a death eater? What type of garbage is that? How dare they drag his name through the mud and tarnish his memory like this.

Thirdly: Voldemort has a child? This is such a plot line cop out and even while reading it this doesn't make sense. Voldemort was conceived under a love potion, he doesn't know or understand love. Even with Bellatrix falling head over heels for him, in what universe do these two  get together and make a baby? And wouldn't Hermione have noticed that Bellatrix was pregnant when she used polyjuice potion to become her so they could enter her vault in Deathly Hallows?

And then Scorpious and Albus constantly referring to eachother as their best friend got to be annoying. And I am still wondering what qualities either of these boys possess that had them sorted into slytherin.

There were parts I did enjoy but they were few and far between. This is without a doubt garbage and I hope that Jo did not write this and that a corrected version of this will appear on pottermore or in print at a later date. My only hope is that I can return to reading the original 7 books and seeing the original 7 movies without this mashup of terrible plot lines tarnishing my love for Harry Potter.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_161?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=161&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm really sad to say it felt hollow. The reader gets a small look into the characters with little development. Ron is portrayed as a complete goof with no charm. In fact the whole original cast seems to have completely changed with Ginny the only one who turned out even remotely respectable.
The hard part is this is a script. This was written to be depicted by actors and actresses and therefore is lacking detail and strong character development.

It's awful.  Thorne should have left it how it was.  The whole story contradicts the last line of Harry Potter and the deathly hallows, when it says his scar hadn't hurt for the past 19 years.  I hate this so much, that's all I'm going to actually say.
 But there are some thought provoking ideas in it.....
 Ha, who am I kidding? I'm beating around the bush, simply because I can't remember what actually happened.  I read it when it first came out, threw it out the window (where it is still today, lying in the garden, where all vegetation refuses to grow since it is so bad), and haven't read it since.
To be honest, I nearly gave up on Harry Potter after that.  You know what supposedly happens.  Voldemort, or his spawn isn't truly defeated; how can you read each and every one of Harry's victories without having harry Potter and the cursed child whispering in the back of your mind?

This might be the worst thing I've ever read. None of the characters felt like themselves. And I must say that the whole time travel thing was a big mistake. I've always thought that The Prisoner of Azkaban handled the time travel aspect rather well and the fact that the ""changes"" made in the past were actually visible in the present. That being said, if it were possible for someone to go back in time to save Cedric...he wouldn't have died in the first place! This book made me hate time travel plots even more. It is a weak premise to base a book on.
I can't believe JKR allowed this trash to have her name associated with it. If she wanted this story told she should have written it herself in a well thought out book format that didn't have gigantic plot holes and stay true to characters.

The main characters seemed like different people, too--and not in an ""Oh, well, it IS 19+ years later"" sort of way, but like they were entirely different personalities who happened to have the same names.

In fact, Rowling shouldn't put her name on it at all.  The characters have strangely different personalities, especially Ginny, Ron and Harry. The only person that's still more-or-less true is Hermione. The story is based on a magical world, but there's nothing magical about the story. The story is not different from any other time-travel stories in any significant way. I don't know about anyone else, but I could  totally predict what happens next when reading it. The first half of the book was so boring that I almost decided to throw it away. (Had I known how Rowling didn't have much to do with the book I would have) The story is conventional and full of the cheesy hollywood value about love and family, which is fine except when it's executed in such a bad way.

I guess the part I'm really surprised by is that Rowling felt author Jack Thorne had ""entered her world"" (see her dedication in the book). Despite a lack of character development and details you might get from a novel the first part was mildly amusing and I think had decent potential--mind you, not the potential of the HP series but the potential to not drive me batty. However, in the second part the book completely fell apart and the ""plot twist"" was not only predictable but extremely unconvincing. My least favorite thing about this book is the way some of our most beloved (and hated) characters were portrayed--McGonagall, Dumbledore, Hermonie, Ron, Harry, Snape, and even Umbridge. I know character development is hard when you're writing a script and not a novel, but these characters hardly resembled the ones of the HP series and did much to deflate my imagination. It felt like Jack Thorne was more concerned with cramming as many of them between the book cover for the nostalgic factor...but there was no nostalgia. Even the new characters were really lacking--Albus, Scorpio, and Delphini. At the end of it all it read like a cheap piece of fan fiction.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's not written as well as the first 7 books. The first 7 books go into great depth of each character and let you really get to know them.  This seems to be just written for high action entertainment instead of plot likers.  Besides the plot holes it seems to contradict things from the book series.  It was an easy read that I finished in 24 hours.  There were very clear differences between the books that were writtten by JK and this joint effort. This book lacks her wit and humor and just repeats things from her books.  I've read and loved the 7 Harry Books she wrote MANY times. So it was very tedious to reread quotes from them over and over and over again.  This play is like one of those tv shows where they just show you the clips from old episodes with very little new material. And I'm guessing this play makes the assumption that you've read her updates to the story on Pottermore?  There were some real holes in continuity from where the last book left off and where this one picked up.  We miss out on a lot of the beloved characters.  There is no Dursely humor. There is no Hagrid, no house elves, only the mention of a ghost other than Moaning Myrtle who gets a few lines,
  ------ spoiler alert--------------

In book 7, Voldemort killed the horcrux residing in Harry. That got rid of Harry's scar and his ability to speak Parsiltongue.  Both his scar and Parsiltongue are back in this book.

His scar hurt in the books because he had Voldemort's soul fragment, Horcrux, in his body. That's gone now yet his scar hurts because of Voldemort's daughter being around?  Since he no longer is connected to Voldemort, he has no connection to his daughter.

  I'll never pre-order a book from Amazon again. I tried to call them to see when it would be delivered during the release date. I couldn't get even a yes or no answer from 3 different people I tried to ask about it. Then on the release date when it wasn't delivered to my kindle I called to find out why not, and they had cancelled my order. WHAT?! I called to see when it would be delivered and they cancelled it?!  What a nightmarish company Amazon Kindle has become to deal with.  Their operators clearly don't speak English.  They can only recite what's on their scripts, So if you ask them a question that's not on their script they just keep reciting things that don't have anything to do with what you are asking about, such as what time in my own time zone will this be downloaded to my kindle?  Can I do anything to download it as soon as it's midnight? - no answer to either question, then after all they put me through, to cancel my order?  And that's on top of them poorly pronouncing English words so that they are barely recognizable. They talk in a loud background so you can barely make out what they are saying. And the one operator breathed heavily into the phone the entire time and after giving him a bad review he called me back to do that more to me. Ugh.

It reads like bad fan fiction -  all the magic of the original series is gone.  Harry, Ron, Hermione and many of the original characters appear, but are sad, flat versions of themselves.  Albus Potter, as the protagonist, is completely unsympathetic and his motives, which drive the plot, never seem justified.  The storyline is not compelling, just depressing.  And there are serious flaws in the plot which render it all ridiculous....SPOILER ALERT: Bellatrix Lestrange secretly gives birth to Voldemort's child just before the Battle of Hogwarts?!? For that to be true, she would have been obviously pregnant in several scenes in Book 7.  How would no one have noticed that?!?!?  Also, Polyjuice potion cannot be brewed in a day. And how, if the Potters' house is protected by the Fidelius charm, did they find the Potters and steal the blanket???

Rowling’s stamp of approval, let alone the eighth installment of the Harry Potter series.  I grew up alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and I practically breathed the wizarding world as a child.  I was horribly disappointed on my eleventh birthday when my long-awaited Hogwarts letter got lost in the mail (it. is. still. coming!  I 100% blame Errol).  I dressed up as Harry Potter, wig and all, for four consecutive Halloweens, despite everyone I encountered automatically assuming I was a boy as a result.  I desperately wanted to fall in love again with the magic that Rowling wove in previous installments, but in the back of my mind I knew it was a little too good to be true.

The one aspect that I tremendously enjoyed were the insights provided on the various characters as they aged and moved on with their lives following the seventh book and the Battle of Hogwarts.  I also appreciated the glimpses into the lives of a wide array of minor characters that were only briefly mentioned in preceding books (although I’m still waiting for Peeves to make an appearance).  Above and beyond that, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child quickly train-wrecked with essentially no other redeeming qualities.

Most noticeably, the play read like poorly-written fanfiction, which it was, in fact, considering that J.K. Rowling played no part in the actual writing of the script.  The writing in no way, shape, or form could remotely compare to Rowling’s, a fact that was painfully obvious and further highlighted by blatant differences in styling, phrasing, etc.  The dialogue routinely seemed awkward, out of place, and forced.  While I tackled the book with full knowledge that this a script for a play that is intended to be watched rather than read, I doubt the verbal delivery of these lines would be any less off-putting.

The characters routinely acted and spoke out of character, differing greatly from the individuals Rowling had carefully crafted over the years.  They lacked a certain depth, and they were no longer motivated by the same factors nor upheld the same values.  Therefore, the characters I thought I knew were given entirely new (and highly unwelcome) personalities, traits, and beliefs by Thorne.  Yes, the play is set nineteen years after the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so I expected there to be some alterations to the manners in which the characters spoke and behaved, but nothing this drastic.  The characters were so utterly unrecognizable that, had Thorne changed their names, I would never have identified them as belonging to the Harry Potter franchise.

Thorne turned the characters into simple-minded, buffoons, each with a singular focus or selfish aspiration.  Ron, for example, was a complete joke throughout the play, serving purely as comic relief.  While I adored his character in Rowling’s books, he came across as an immature idiot in the play who never transcended adolescence.  Similarly, Draco appeared to have lost his edge – his comments were no longer biting and acrid, and he didn’t appear to foster the same hatred for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  He actually appeared to tolerate them.  People can’t alter their mindsets and ideals that severely.  My guess is one too many bludgers to the head.

The entire cast of characters were exceedingly flat and static with seemingly no affection or concern for their contemporaries.  When Harry volunteered to insert himself into a dangerous situation, his peers were more than willing to step aside with not so much as a “good luck” or “see you later,”  let alone genuine concern.  What happened to the unbreakable bond between the trio?  Why are they interacting like mere acquaintances as opposed to old friends?

The plot, although supposedly Rowling-approved, was riddled with plot holes and a multitude of suspicion-raising coincidences.  Most prominently, the focus had evidently shifted from the previous struggle between good versus evil and emphasis on magic and the wizarding world to a more mature tone that identified the challenges associated with partaking in a family dynamic as well as holding positions of power.  While this wasn’t necessarily a poor decision in and of itself, it wasn’t well-executed.  To compound matters further, the incorporated scenes felt rather fake and atypical – they didn’t capture the beloved, everyday moments portrayed in the remainder of the series: Quidditch practices, meals in the Great Hall, shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley, stirring up trouble in Hosmeade, completing homework in the Common Room, etc.  What happened to the Hogwarts scenes and memories that I came to cherish over the years?  As a result, it didn’t feel like part of the same franchise, let alone the next installment of the series.

What little plot was present was merely a ripoff of the original novels – Thorne simply rehashed the past to avoid introducing any creativity, calling into play the same villain, the same settings, and the same tired themes.  They were new and exciting the first time around, but not the second or third.  The play, overall, lacked originality and creativity, even for a fanfiction.

And lastly, it’s a play for Christ’s sake.  It has an entirely different persona and feel to it than the rest of the series, causing it to stand out and attract attention.  The book as a whole seems like more of a cringeworthy afterthought, and I would have been perfectly content having left off with the epilogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

I’m still in shock.  I so badly wanted to relive the magic that I recall from childhood of cracking open a new Harry Potter book for the first time and completely immersing myself in the story.  I’m still in denial that Rowling endorsed this project from its initial stages, let alone that she has officially designated it as the eighth book in the Harry Potter series.  I don’t think I’ll ever come to accept that fact.

Rowling.  In fact, I saw more Rowling in ""The Casual Vacancy"" than I did in this script.  I suppose some of that could be *because* it was a script, but even then, it's, what, a two-part play in something like 4 hours?  C'mon!  This story, such as it was, could've been told loads quicker than that, and would've been far less deadly.  In any case, though I'm not necessarily a die-hard Potter fan, I didn't find this believable - too many characters speaking what was, to me, waay OUT of character - and I'm sorry it's being considered Potter canon.

This should be read as fan fiction. This book is an insult to the characters of Harry Potter, particularly in the cases of Snape, Draco, and Ron. They are written as if constantly being impersonated through someone else's use of Polyjuice Potion. Harry Potter is a big part of my life, I was very hesitant to read this book because I was worried it would taint the magnificence of the series. It did, it's awful. It makes no sense. It was as if the writers hadn't read the series at all. It's full of plot holes. It makes me angry knowing that it exists.When it was just a play, it could be considered a spin off. But to claim to be the 8th book of the series is a huge mistake.

Biggest piece of idiot excrement I've ever had the misfortune to come across.

I have been a longtime Harry Potter fan. I read the books several times a year when I get the chance, and I collect memorabilia. It was a crucial part of my childhood and, as such, I was excited and hopeful for this latest edition. Although I went into this book knowing that it was A) not written by JK Rowling and B) not in its traditional format, but a play, I had high expectations that it would be as magical and titillating as the series has always been for me given that Rowling endorsed it herself and has given it high praise.

How wrong I was. The characters have been assassinated. Plot holes rob this story of any cohesion. Blatant inaccuracies exist within its pages that force us to deviate so far from what we know to be true in the original novels - basic ideas such as how magic works, how potions work, how time works. Ideas that have been dissected and discussed by fans across the world and confirmed by JK Rowling herself only to be thrown to the side in this sorry excuse for a continuation of Harry Potter.

On principle, I refuse to include spoilers in this post. If you would like to read this book, be my guest. In fact, I encourage it so that you, too, can understand where the negative reviews are coming from. I have been a longtime supporter and defender of Rowling and continued endeavors to keep the Harry Potter world alive and I will not write off the series, or her, with the reveal of this catastrophe. However, I cannot support this play. I cannot support this playscript. I cannot, in any way, support the idea that this content is considered canon in the Harry Potter universe, as not only is it a contrived and immature plot, but also the bulk of the book and its ideas go against everything that we already know to be true and confirmed by Rowling herself.

I will support future Potter projects that Rowling has written herself, however, this may be the last time that I pick up anything that was written by another and endorsed by her. This is not something that I would ever enjoy picking up and reading again, nor is it something that I want to see on the stage. I am sure the very talented and accomplished actors who will be performing it are stunning in their performance, but the story is so poorly written that I am not sure their talent can save the show alone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I've read each of the books 1-7 about 10 times each. I was utterly obsessed with the books in middle and high school and still very much enjoy them as an adult. This story, however, is equivalent to poorly written fanciful fan fiction with little direction. I was a theatre major in college and have read literally hundreds of play scripts, so that was not the issue for me. It simply did not seem like Rowling wrote this. The plot and exposition were uncomplicated, slow, and simply bad. The characters seemed very different from their former selves (even taking into account that, yes, of course 37 year old Harry, Ron, and Hermione will be different and more mature than their 17 year old selves). And the language was not the same magic we know and love from the books. Again, I know all too well that novels and plays are different artistic mediums, yet still, this story falls very flat. I definitely do NOT recommend this read and will be doing my best to delete its contents from my memory.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The existing characters in adulthood were portrayed completely wrong - I mean I know they grew up but their personalities wouldn't have changed so drastically! Some of it was just plain insulting to the characters memory (I mean come on...Cedric a Death Eater?!) And the new characters that were introduced did not have enough character development. There were giant holes throughout the plot line. I mean at certain points in the book I actually found myself turning back pages thinking I had accidentally skipped a section because it totally jumped without transition! If I hadn't thrown away my receipt I would actually consider returning the book. I do not consider it to be part of the Harry Potter library.

But this I felt does a disservice to J K Rowland's Potter books and characters.  The actions of primary three seem out of character.  Harry apparently couldn't find time to help Albis with his schooling at Hogwarts, his self confidence or even flying  a broom. It always seemed from the books that he enjoyed teaching and could wind up as a defense of the dark arts instructor but apparently not with his son.  Plus the ministry has learned nothing in 20+  years and still has no way to detect polyjuice imposters which you'd think would be a priority.  Harry is still being accused of killing Cedric and many others neglecting the fact that it was Voldermort, not Harry.  The bulling continues. Gone is the heart, the friendship and the wry humor of the original books.  The whole story just doesn't wash for me.  I didn't mind the play format but did mind the story and the out of character characters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Barger","The First Book I Ever Threw Away","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2016","I just wanted to add my opinion to the masses - please do not read this book. I've never been so disappointed by a book in my entire life. In fact, it's the only book I've ever thrown away.

I am a huge HP fan. It literally changed my life, and I've invested thousands of hours and dollars into the franchise. I keep my first copy of the first book in a fireproof safe, alongside pictures of my grandfather and my most cherished sentimental belongings.

But I couldn't even finish this book. I got about 75% of the way through before throwing it across the room in frustration. I eventually skimmed through the last few pages but it was harder and less pleasant than reading a Calculus book. I was so angry that I threw the book away. I've never done that before, even to my Twilight books. Twilight is a work of art compared to this.

This book ruined my views of the Harry Potter series. I intended on re-reading them all after I finished it, but now I can't even look at them without getting a sick feeling in my stomach. I know this sounds melodramatic and extreme, but it's the honest truth... It's like someone spit on my childhood.

Please do not read this book. If anything, read the plot summary online and leave it at that.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This, however, is a chaotic mess, a mash-up of other story arcs, and a monumental disappointment.

While the script format could have been clever, the plot is lame and the dialogue is forced and silly.  The characters we had come to know through the ""real"" Harry Potter books are watered-down, shallow, thin, and barely recognizable.

I kept reading waiting for redeeming value, but sadly, there is none to be found in this horribly written bit of overly sentimental schlock.

If only Rowling herself would bring her creative powers to her Harry Potter series to keep it going, this sort of callow offering would not have been marketed.

It's that bad.

The play format isn't obnoxious; it's easy to read. That's the only thing going for this book; you'll get through it quickly, provided you don't damage it too badly throwing it across the room in disgust every time you encounter another badly-written passage.

 Everything other reviewers are saying about this being a fanfiction is true. The characters are underdeveloped; after everything we saw in the first books, there was a lot they could have drawn on for who these characters are. They also don't seem to be very British anymore, which is odd. The interaction between characters is wooden and in places just ridiculous. The plot... I won't give spoilers, but let's just say that there's so much deus ex machina that it's downright disturbing. Rather than inventing a new plot, they contrived a way to retread the old plots, which feels cheap and lazy.

The teenagers don't act like teenagers. Too many of the conversations are exposition tools, and in stilted language that kids don't use. It's as if they didn't actually know any teenagers when they wrote this. The adults, however, DO sound like teenagers. They simultaneously kept the teenage mannerisms of the main HP characters, without keeping their inherent deeper personalities.

I don't believe in bad books. But... this is a bad book. Even on its own, it would be a brutal read; as part of the HP universe, it's a bitter disappointment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Like many of the reviewers on here, I have grown up with Harry Potter. These books have been a huge part of my life ever since I received the Sorcerer’s Stone and Chamber of Secrets for Christmas seventeen years ago, when I was in second grade. These books got me into loving to read, they brought me closer to my family, who read the books to me when I was young, they inspired my love for fandoms and geek culture in general, they got me through difficult times, and they shaped the person that I am today.
I was not expecting too much from this book/play. I figured that I would go in with low expectations so that the story would hopefully rise above them and I wouldn’t be disappointed. Oh boy, that technique did not work. I knew that the story was written along with two other authors, however I was not aware of just how much of this story was not written by JK Rowling. The advertising for this book was very deceptive in this way. The vast majority of this story can not have been written by JK Rowling. As many reviewers have said, the first thing that I thought of when I had gotten seventy-five pages into the book and finally started to realize that it wasn’t just getting off to a rocky start and improving as it went along, was that it read like bad fanfiction. I had a feeling that things would only get worse from there, so I skipped ahead to spoil the ending for myself, something that I usually never do. But man, am I glad that I did. I saved myself even more frustration. I will not be finishing this book. It is a disgrace to the fantastic seven books that Jo gave to the world. I am honestly shocked that she approved this story for publishing. I am willing to bet that there are fan fiction stories out there that are a hundred times better than this book and are way more worthy of publishing. The writers who wrote this story clearly did not understand or care to understand much of anything from the original stories. It pains me to know that this book is technically considered canon, but for my own sake, I refuse to call it canon. I thought that the mediocre and often downright boring movies were the worst it could get for Harry Potter, but clearly they were not. These wonderful stories deserve so much better. I am so disappointed with Jo. And I truly hope that this is the last time that these amazing characters and stories are pulled back out just to be paraded around in ways that are insulting to the fans and to the original stories and all that they represent.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is very poor fan fiction.  The play format isn't my favorite but on such well established characters, no need to over elaborate.  We know what these characters are.  Who they are.  Their personalities, fears, hopes, dreams. And now let me tell you that they're so completely out of character that they are barely recognizable.  It also takes liberties with the original story lines.  Those of you who have read the books and seen the movies more times that you can count know when something is wrong on this book.

I guess the good news is that the actual play is a big hit.  As for this book, I'm very disappointed JKR signed off on this tripe.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

  Spoilers

for instance the fiddelus charm was still working the night the potters died so harry should not have seen his parents from outside the house and it takes a month to make the polyjuice potion and its super hard to make as said in hogwarts power politics and pesky poletergists so dephi would not be like ""hey i happen to have some polyjuice potion in my pocket"" plus you need the hair from the person you are transforming into so i don't  know how the heck did they get the hair from Harry ,Ron and Hermione. and how does Dephi know so much spells even though she did not go th Hogwarts let alone know how to fly. Plus the name voldermort is allowed to be said and harry says his scar has not hurt for 22 years? this story is 19 years later not 22! Harry is said to be 40 but he is actually 37!! Harry, Ron ,Hermione  , Ginny and Draco ar like shells of their former selfs and harry never uses expelermus anymore. Belletrix Lestrange is not pregnent while tourchering Hermione Bus Jack thorne decides ""hey lets just make her pregnant!"" plus Voldermort and Belatrix Lestrange shacked up in the malfroys?!?! Albus acts like a spoilt kid and scorpius ends up the main character. JK Rowling destroys the time turners for a reason in the fifth book. plus it was clearly stated in hogwarts a uncomplete and unreliable guide that kingsly shacklebolt was voted for minister for magic not Hermione ! plus this prophecy was clearly last minute and if Dephi wanted lord Voldermort to rule she could have stoped voldermort killing Harry but it was plan B not A but saving Cedric as he could have just helped Harry in his 5th year?????? and thanks for ruining Cedric for us. luckly they did not add Sirius, Lupin or James. this 'book' is just rubbish wrote by jack****Thorne not Rowling if you realy want it just borrow it from the library.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_93?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=93&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Brumfield III","Disrespectful to the source material and poorly written as well","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2016","I get that art is inherently subjective, but I'm truly at a loss to understand how anyone felt this work was thoughtful or respectful.

It directly contradicts canon. It gets characterization all wrong. The main plot points really fly in the face of the series. It primarily centers on the weakest plot element from the original books. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was akin to Mission Impossible 2 over-playing the face mask gag from the original Mission Impossible movie.

This is a rare work that is not only terrible itself, it undermines what came before it.

I literally had to step away from this several times and then force myself to come back. It was really hard to get through the first half of this because of how terrible the writing is. This criticism is often dismissed by the defenders saying people are just not used to reading plays, but I'm an actor who loves reading plays. But the stage directions aren't so much stage directions as they are needless melodrama. There is a scene with a missing family member so the stage direction reads ""There is a lot of tension in the room!"" You don't need to spell out the obvious. You only need to description the non-verbal action with stage directions.

The second half isn't quite as cringe-worthy from a writing perspective, though the plot and characterization is pretty poor all throughout.

I imagine this might be an entertaining play to watch because of the effects necessarily for all the magic, but this was a truly terrible read.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_93?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=93&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter is a story I grew up with, I was eight years old when I read this Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This was the book that introduced me to the wonder and the magic that is the Harry Potter universe. I was nearing 15 when the last book was released. This was, as I believed, to the last installment of the Harry Potter series. After all the trails and tribulations I as so many others have, felt the intensity of the ending and itch for more. When I found out about this play I was so excited by the notion of another installment!
Reading through this story reminded me of a really poor fan story. I was disappointed beyond belief. The characters JK had spent years developing became very static, there was no development on the solid foundation that was left. The characters seemed to almost regress back into a state that was very reminiscent of their very first year at Hogwarts. The entire plot had so many holes it reminded me of Swiss cheese. All in all I strongly believe they could have expanded on this idea much further and made it a decent story versus a pathetic attempt at a sequel that so many fans are thoroughly disappointment in.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If you insist on reading it, treat it like a fan fiction because it truly does not jive at all with the world that JK Rowling created.

I was disappointed by the changes to the characters, by the lack of plot development and story holes, and the unrealistic ideas presented. I felt there were so many things that never would have occurred had these characters been in line with their original personalities (set forth in the other seven books). Part of the magic of the HP novels was that they were consistent. The characterization was real and the main trio were reliable and kind; things they most certainly are not in this most recent story. SPOILERS: Harry deserves the award for Worst Father of the Year, Hermione is a ministry maid and apparently absent at home, Ron lacks all of his charm and quirks, Ginny is as flat as she was in the movies, and Snape is perhaps the most disappointing of all! Every word from his mouth is in stark contrast to the character we knew and hated (and loved).

I am sure the play is entertaining and the production set is great but this story is the greatest letdown the Harry Potter world has faced yet. Sometimes no story is better than any story, and that is certainly true in this case. I desperately wish I could un-read this story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_167?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=167&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's sad that's she has allowed her name to be plastered on the front of this book, because the writing style doesn't even come close to her own.  It makes me wonder if she'd read the script, or only saw the production.
The best was to summarize this explanation, is to compare it to ""Wicked"".  We're all familiar with The Wizard of Oz, but no one ever thought what had happened there before Dorothy arrived.  That's why the 'book' (not script) was popular (pun intended), & eventually written as a screenplay.
This script is being touted as ""Book 8"".  Sadly, that's not what it is at all.  JK ruined the characters by allowing someone else to ""puppeteer"" her characters which she slowly allowed to grow and thrive.  It's proof that a ""Book 9"" won't be written, because she'll have to clean up what was essentially a ghost writer did to her characters.
The only way she'd be able to revive HP, would be to write a prequel. And that d need to be a direct prequel to The Harry Potter series.  NOT Fantastic Beasts, which only links to Potter's world because he reads the book at Hogwarts.
Book 8 has essentially ended Harry Potter for good.
It's fantastic to be able to imagine the characters coming back to life in our heads, but sadly, I think this may have been ""money motivated"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Where JK had previously concluded the original story with care, by revisiting these same characters the author has managed to ruin that original ending and muck up the HP universe by raising so many questions that the story doesn't bother answering.

Fanfic drowning in nostalgia/sentimentality","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","Well, I guess adults will appreciate Harry & friends' parenting woes, but this will just depress kids who've loved the books--so be kind and warn them that this is a boring book about parenting (or something like that). Most of everything's already been said, but I'll just comment that I understand now why JKR refused to keep churning out more books like so many other commercially successful authors do to squeeze every ounce out of popularity from their early books possible. And she did well to quit after 7.

I won't completely criticize her though for taking part in this play as I think it probably started as a creative idea. But I do wonder how she signed off on the script as the author went way too far with the nostalgic fanfic aspect. I mean, half of it is like 'oh, let's remind ourselves of all the cool highlights from the HP years! But not in a cool way!' I liked the two kid protagonists, particularly Draco's kid, but they weren't awesome enough to make the whole story worthwhile. And I'll just say that the dialog is tragic--way too much sentimental cheese rather than the wit we expected--and way too many let-me-explain-my-emotions-to-the-therapist soliloquies that are totally fine and great for first drafts but so not okay for a narrative with any movement. Not sure how this was pulled off on stage in that sense.

And finally, every single author should be petrified of time travel while writing about time travel. I'm not a hardcore scifi fan who demands the sanctity of logical physics in a fantasy, but you gotta think things through. And usually your first plot idea is going to break down big time. HP & the Cursed Child is not an exception. So much worse when you have magical solutions at your beck and call that can completely ruin your time travel plot! JKR worked pretty hard to keep things tight plotwise in her books, whereas this story amazingly suffers from almost eyerollingly magical magic.

So glad I borrowed this from the library rather than plunk down good money for it.

As a long time fan who has read and retread this series countless times I am very disappointed. Time travel as a plot device needs to be done right to work and it simply doesn't in this. At no point was I overly concerned about the fate of the characters nor was I sympathetic with main character albus potter. Maybe the script format makes it difficult to connect with characters and understand their motivations but I found the whole parent son relationship problem forced down the readers throats and eye roll worthy.  Spoilers ahead to save trouble of reading.  What good moments are Hidden in mediocrity

Albus potter is indeed sorted into slytherin and becomes best friends with Scorpius malfoy. Albus is black sheep of family with no great magic talent and isn't good at anything. Hermonie is minister of magic, Harry is head of magical law enforcement and Ron helps run The joke shop. Harry finds a custom time turner during a raid and is approached by Amos diggory to use it to save Cedric and he refuses. Albus overhears and decides to steal the time turner and drags Scorpius with him. The time line is almost destroyed blah blah blah ending with battling evil descendant of a death eater who wants to prevent dark lords fall during the night of Harry's parents death in godrics hallow.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_160?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=160&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am unsure what I can write that has not already been written, but I will try to contribute.  I should start by saying that I am an incredibly devoted fan who has cosplayed Harry Potter and who avidly anticipated this new installment of the Harry Potter world. Like many others, I question how much Rowling contributed to this and I agree that it is like a horrible fanfiction.  A Very Potter Music, a parody, is more canon to the fans of Harry Potter than this debacle.

A few reasons that this dismays me go as follows (Please, excuse the spoilers):
1. JK Rowling has admitted her folly with time turners.  Yet, they were the main plot device in this book.  It was almost used to explain why one could not have used them to go back in time to stop Voldemort.
2. The characters were disastrous.
  a. Harry Potter, who has completely mistreated by his aunt, uncle, and cousin would never have treated his son so shamefully.
  b. Ron was used as a comic relief and a joke.
  c. Hermione wasn't Harry's best friend; Ron was. However, Harry treated her as such.
  d. There are more, but I don't have time.
3. Bellatrix was never pregnant which makes the whole plot moot.

Anyway, if you must ruin your Harry Potter experience, please rent it from the library.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I wanted to immerse myself in 320 pages of old friends and new friends and love it.  Instead, I put the book down as I finished it and just thought ""eh.""

1) The plot -- weak beyond weak.  'Going back in time causes changes in the present' is one of the oldest 'what ifs' in history, and authors have used it beautifully to explore possibilities (see Amazon's original series Man in the High Castle for a great example!) Unfortunately, this book used the ""what if"" as a cheesy excuse to stick scenes from past books in almost word for word.  Not only that, but the ""effects"" of the ""changes"" were weak and not substantiated by the cannon of Harry Potter.
2) The characters -- see the above...if you're a Harry Potter superfan you know these characters like your own best friends - but even if all you've done is read the books, you still have clear expectations of characters.  Rowling's series is YA literature, and despite the classes that have tried to read depth into them, the characters are unarguably clear.  Having those characters change dramatically in a story with no catalyst besides ""getting older"" or ""thinking"" is a huge plot weakness. (I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but Harry not being Harry, Hermione and Ron almost completely negligible - characters of themselves, Draco?? )
3) The writing....this is the death knell in my eyes.  It doesn't ring with JK Rowling's language.  Reading this is basically like reading a cliff notes version of a weak fan fiction piece.  The language, the voice, the diction -- all of it basic and weak.  Don't try to tell me it's because it's a play.....I read plays fairly frequently, and depth and beauty of language is even more important on stage -- see Tennessee Williams, or even Miranda's recent Hamilton. This just feels rushed and forced.  I'm sure great actors could make it feel better - but as a pure script it fails.
Overall, my final review is that this feels like a very weak attempt to keep the Harry Potter money train moving forward.  I hate to say anything against Rowling, but this is clearly NOT her work...and why she would put her name on it is beyond me unless she just wants the money.  My suggestion -- check it out from the library, don't waste your money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_189?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=189&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Really","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2016","Allow me to begin by saying that I adore the original Harry Potter series. It's entertaining, poignant, and unforgettable. J.K. Rowling has conjured up a whole new world that rivals Narnia or Middle Earth.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is just not in the same literary ballpark. I mean, if books were baseball, the original seven and their companion stories would be in the World Series, while the Cursed Child would get beat out by the lowliest T-ball team. It sucked. Really, really sucked. Why, you ask?

Well, for starters, the characters do not resemble those created by Rowling. I don't want to be too specific, but these people are barely recognizable compared to their previous incarnations. Either they are behaving like they had a personality swap or they are basically reduced to caricatures. (Poor Ron- I was embarrassed for him!)

The plot is full of holes. The dialogue is stilted. I have devoured every other HP book, but this one I had to force myself to finish- it was that boring!

I truly don't see why she put her name on this product. I have read fanfiction that was far more interesting and better written.

If you are a true HP fan like myself, I am sure you will feel compelled to read this anyway. My suggestion is that you borrow a copy from a friend or local library, so that the ""authors"" don't get any more money for this ridiculous play.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_119?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=119&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was so devastatingly disappointed with this ""book"" that I tried to go back and read the old harry potter, but it wasn't the same.

There's no way on earth J.K Rowling contributed in any way here... at all.

I grew up with the Harry Potter books and reading this was like losing a lifelong friend. I was honestly in horrified disbelief reading this. If, like myself, you regularly reread the Harry Potter books in a nostalgic and comfortably familiar way, this book will shatter you. I anticipated being disappointed because I read a brief synopsis of the plot before purchasing but it was ten times worse. At first I thought the online description was a joke. Surely it couldn't be that bad. But it was. It really was that bad. I would venture to say the Wikipedia summary is as good as or better than the play. I resigned myself to reading it because Harry Potter is one of the few series which have an enduring place on my bookshelf and in my heart and I wanted to support it's legacy. I read this book in horrified disbelief on a 24 hour hell of airplanes and layovers. This was worse than the security check and delayed flight.

 The play was written with the endorsement of Harry Potter author JK Rowling and apparently some collaborative efforts but it reads as a poorly imagined and terribly executed fan fiction. It draws from other fictional works like Star Wars in its contrived plot and deviates from established truths and details from the Harry Potter books.

Without revealing too much, some of the low points and deviations include the replacement of Ron's personality for Fred and George's. Ron also gets their jokeshop because apparently the authors combined all the Weasleys into Ron and Ginny. I would have preferred they just not be mentioned rather than suddenly change Ron into a laugh a minute practical joker. In this poorly imagined Harry Potter universe, the characters are reduced to one dimensional versions of the original series. Another example would be time turners. Though we have encountered them before until they were all smashed in the Harry Potter books, they are brought back with new rules that only make sense if you completely forget the past Harry Potter books. And so on. I would classify it as a tragic comedy because it's unbelievable how terribly this was done. It's almost like they decided to take random plot elements and events in the original series and mash them together in the most horrible way possible. It's like a cross between MadLibs, the worst possible fan fiction, and a choose your adventure story.

I read this book the day it was released but have only now gotten around to posting a review because I needed to recover. It was truly that bad. Since reading The Cursed Child i have reread the real Harry Potter books and read several true literary works and enjoyable, engaging novels. If you have never read Harry Potter books you may enjoy this play. If you are a Harry Potter fan you've probably read this and were left disappointed like me. If you haven't read it and are weighing the pros and cons, it is a waste of time and a huge disappointment. I personally would not use a time turner to go back and unread it because at least now I know it really is this awful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I grew up with these stories. I pre ordered books 4-7 on Amazon as a child, flew to Florida just for HP World, listen to the audio books on repeat, all of it. But this.... this screenplay... is an abomination of all things HP. This play wouldn't have worked without JKs approval, but her approval is a discrace and just a way to ensure it makes money. The characters are so wrong, the things they say, the things they do, the actual characters would never ever in a million years say or do. It makes Harry look like a terrible dad, Ron an idiot, Hermione unethical. Don't even get me started on the concept of Voldemort procreating. I wish I wouldn't have read this.

I hated giving this book only one star. I'm a huge, huge fan of JK Rowling's work. I've been reading the Potter books once a year since they came out. I've read her other works, as well. I adore them all. This just does not hold a candle to the rest.  I had not realized at first this would be in screen play format, which is really annoying and difficult to read-my fault for not paying attention to that. I had to force myself to get through it.The plot is weak and has holes, too many questions left unanswered, the story was rushed, and the characters actions were out of character (primarily Harry.)  It just seemed as if the attention to detail and rich storytelling that we are accustomed to with Rowling were missing.  This one  missed the mark.

Weak, horrible father Harry Potter? Seriously. Yeah he had a crap childhood but there’s no way someone with as much love inside him as Harry would have treated his child that way. Stupid Ron? Ron might have been oblivious in many ways but he was far from stupid, oh and giving a kid a love potion after he accidentally took one in school? WTH. Hermianie, oh just so much wrong with her character. Basically her entire personality depends on Ron? If they aren’t together she becomes someone else completely?

Let me start off by saying I am a Potterhead to the core.  I re-read the entire series at least once a year and sometimes twice.  When I first found out this book was coming out I knew it would go one of two ways.... It was either going to be amazing or absolutely horrible.  This was the latter.  If I could give it half a star, I would.  I went into this read with no expectations, but was still left with disappointment.

Firstly, this books reads like fanfiction and not even the good kind.  The original characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) were so unlike themselves it was hard to picture them as the same characters I loved in the series.  Ron is now basically the not funny dad always trying to play jokes, Hermione seems cold and distant, and Harry...well, he's just not Harry.  The story line is also just complete garbage.  Without spoiling the book, THERE IS NO WAY THIS PLOT MAKES ANY SENSE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED!!!

I really really did","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","I want to start this by saying that I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I grew up with Harry, I went to midnight premiers of the books and movies. I was so excited for this play. I wanted to like it. I really really did. If you are a fan I would say read it and form your own opinion. Here is what I thought:

-  Where was George?
-  Where was Teddy? Because he was in the station in th epilogue.
-  Where was Hugo? You know the other child Ron and Hermione have.
-  Lily and James Potter… MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it?
-  Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN’T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?!
-  Let’s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play.
-  Harry’s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting.
o  In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying “I’m famous”. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad’s legacy. Huh.
o  Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let’s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry’s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend.
-  Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend? Awesome.
-  The rumors of Voldemort having a child and that not being stopped by the ministry? Stupid. The ministry would have stopped panic about an heir being possible. Also Voldemort was conceived without love. He never cared about having an heir because he wanted to be in power. An heir would have been competition for him.
-  More on that point. Bellatrix pregnant. She would have loved to mother the Dark Lords child; there would have been no greater honor. But. This does not work with the original time line. Bella is never pregnant, she fights at the battle. And then the gang goes to Malfoy manor there is no baby in sight. And if. IF. Voldemort would have wanted an heir; wouldn’t he have made it a horcrux and offered it more protection?
-  Sexual tension between Scorpious and Albus. Yet Albus has a crush on Delphi and Scorpious on Lily. I feel as though either they should have been opened about their romantic feels towards each other or this should have not been included.
-  The flashbacks/dreams Harry has. When Dudley is mentioned (yay!) and you find out petunia is dead. I know she was horrible but I do think Harry would have deep feelings about his mother’s sister passing. I liked the blanket part.
-  Bellatrix husband somehow got out of Azkaban and raised Delphi. How did he escape Azkaban? Because there is no way he got pardoned. So how did he escape? And after escaping how was there no alarm over him escaping. Sirius Black escapes and the freaking muggle minister is alerted! Then there is a massive breakout and it is all over the daily prophet. But hey, this guy who tortured the Longbottoms into insanity he escapes and it’s cool. Yeah, sounds legit.
-  The new prophecy. First of all: how did it happen with no one knowing about it except Delphi. Who made it? It’s sounding more and more as if this witch convinced herself that she is the heir of the dark lord.
-  Cedric. Cedric a character who was noble and good and died oh so tragically. This character who was loyal and kind and helped Harry turns DARK SIDE?!?! BECAUSE HE LOSES THE CUP. WHAT?!?! CEDRIC A DEAD EATER HAHAHAHA NOPE NOT FUNNY. Thank you for turning a good character and completely changing him for the worse. Thank goodness you did not include Sirius Black in your play.
-  On that same characters changing note. The trolley lady…. Hm. I will just leave it at that.
-  Polyjuice potion. That s*** takes a month to make. I read the chamber of secrets. Many times. It takes an effing month. And you need a piece of the person you are changing into. But wait not, here I got some polyjuice potion here in my back pocket and I just happen to carry my dad and his best friends hairs at all times. So let’s change into them and break into the ministry.
-  Btw that potion is not necessary because you can transfigure a HUMAN. Seven books and that never came out. Must be very dark magic.
-  On the dark magic note. Harry duels Delphi (a eighteen year old) and she is stronger? Um. Do we not recall Harry being a teenager and he beat Voldemort. His wand is the s***. So yeah how does this even make sense?

As that said purist, I really have nothing but the highest expectation for anything to do with continuing Harry's story. And really, quality should have been their top priority, but it doesn't seem somehow that it was.

I cannot begin to describe the disappointment that met me upon finishing this book. This doesn't feel like Harry Potter. And I never could have dreamed that they would write a story so full of holes and discrepancies. The characters have been completely rewritten (I would like to apologize to Ron, who's character was completely defaced and humiliated), and the storytelling is unbelievably weak and full of holes. I cannot fathom how J.K. Rowling came to approve this story. It is a complete derailment of the seven book series.

Even if I knew how bad it was going to be before I read it, I couldn't have stopped myself, because I needed to know. It's important to be informed. But this is not Harry Potter. It doesn't gleam any essence of Harry's world, there is no spark to it, and what is even more appalling is the way they tried to rewrite actual parts of the original series. This book was beyond disappointing. My back is forever turned from it, in homage to the story that deserves nothing but honoring.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_170?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=170&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS

1. If anybody has a question about the parentage of young Scorpius, a DNA test should set all concerns to rest. Surely Draco could afford such a test and provide samples from himself and his wife's family for comparison purposes. Rowling is married to a physician and would be expected to think of this instantly.

2.  Hermione Granger was called the brightest witch of her age. So her ministry door can be opened with ""Alohomora""? And behind that door she hides an illegal Time-Turner in a book in her library? Giving idiotic riddles as clues to which book it might be in? Right.

3. Hufflepuffs value hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play. Cedric Diggory was the prototype Hufflepuff, but all it took to set him on the path to killing Neville Longbottom (one of the meekest characters in the series) was two humiliating events in the Triwizard Tournament. And the number of Hufflepuffs we have previously seen in the ranks of the Death Eaters is...ZERO. Okay, then.

4. Somehow Bellatrix Lestrange was able to conceive a baby by Voldemort (How? I can't visualize Voldemort wanting anybody to touch him), carry the baby to term under the watchful eyes of a group of powerful Slytherin witches and wizards who would have been resistant to a Confundus Charm, and deliver that baby unnoticed before the Battle of Hogwarts. Not only that, when Hermione used some recently-acquired hair to add to a Polyjuice Potion in order to break into Gringott's bank as Bellatrix, Hermione never noticed that she was pregnant.

5. When Albus and Scorpius briefly stole Baby Harry's blanket while they were in Godric's Hollow, they had to break a Fidelius Charm that even Voldemort couldn't overcome without the cooperation of the Secret Keeper. The Fidelius Charm was used at least three times in the series. Surely Rowling remembers how it works. EDITED TO ADD: On page 255, we see James and Lily leave their house with Harry in a pushchair. Then what was the point of the Fidelius Charm on their cottage??? All Voldemort had to do was make himself invisible and wait for them to take a family walk. Three quick Avada Kedavras and it would all be over. No interaction with the repellent Peter Pettigrew was even necessary.

Book 8 reads as though Tiffany and Thorne did their research from the movies, only reading the first seven books to copy dialog. They didn't know the background of the characters, and settled for caricatures instead. They didn't understand how the magic worked, and used it incorrectly. Rehearsal Edition Script or not, a plot that contains so many obvious errors makes it hard to enjoy the story. Rowling should have ended canon with the Deathly Hallows.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I now know after wasting my time reading this that they were, unfortunately, quite wrong. This is a disaster. It's a sad excuse from J.K. Rowling to enter another story into the Harry Potter universe in such a disgraceful form. She had mentioned in an interview that she didn't want to write another novel. I'm furious that she mutilated the Harry Potter universe nineteen years after - especially starting the dialogue in this script with major discrepancies from the original text in HP DH - allowing others to aid in this sad excuse of a script. Using terms such as ""Thank Dumbledore,"" or bringing back horrible characters in weird ways, it's clear that the writer has either lost touch on this subject or no longer finds it worthy of her time. Couldn't she have perhaps reread her own material to realize in her writing that any angry feelings Harry might have had towards Dumbledore subsided when they spoke at ""Kings Cross""? There's just so much in here that is disappointing and feels to me that she doesn't even remember her own words or how they might evoke certain responses from her audience. It's bad enough that when the original books were turned to films, certain important aspects were altered or removed, but now she's done it all herself with this script... She could have done so much with certain aspects of this plot, and yet, she remained arrogant in her abilities, or simply rushed to spew this out. I can't say more without revealing larger aspects of the plot, so I will just urge you all who are in love with the original seven books to not taint your world of Harry Potter by buying this horrendous script.

P.S.: Ron is not an idiot for crying out loud! He was able to speak Parseltongue just by mimicking Harry in the Battle of Hogwarts! Your pathetic attempts at reviving a lighter mood derived from the easy swag of Fred and George Weasley have only made this script even more ridiculous.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm such a fan of the novels that, at times, I can't watch the films because they are nothing like the books. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this script, and hoped that it would continue the story in a way that left me longing for more. I was severely disappointed.
You'll read it in the other reviews, I'm sure, but the plot holes and characterization of this story were just horrendous. There is no other word for it. You might find yourself, as I did, occasionally swept along in the story, but that doesn't make it a good story. It certainly doesn't excuse the poor writing which is filled to the brim with trope after trope, cliche after cliche, corny phrase after corny phrase. That JK Rowling would lend her support to a script of such poor quality is inconceivable. Perhaps she was confunded?

By page 42 I was ready to be done, by page 242 I was laughing hysterically. This script is pure tripe. I don't have a problem reading it in script form. I would rather read it in a script than be distracted from its flaws by flashing lights and (what I'm sure is) great acting.

Don't pay to read this book.

The storyline wasn't awful, but the carrying out of it was. The characters were underdeveloped and I never found myself attached to them, as in the original series.  You never become invested - you don't really care if the boys achieve their goal.

So I understand that they are not meant to read like a novel. Obviously, they are best experienced on stage.

That said, I have loved dozens of plays that I haven't been able to see. I was hoping this was going to be one of those, too.

It wasn't. From the start, it felt choppy and disconnected. The characters we know and love said and did things entirely out of character, especially Harry. Ginny hardly had a role at all, and all the fierceness has apparently faded.

The plot was subpar. I have literally read the same plot in fanfiction, and I'm pretty sure they were better quality. It felt so contrived. I was hoping for a new villain, a new obstacle. Instead, the writers used time-turners to dredge up the same villain we spent seven books fighting and destroying.

And let's talk about those time-turners. (SPOILERS)

How convenient that an extra special time turner just happened to be created, and that Malfoy just happened to have one too. So. Contrived.

But the thing that bothered me the most? Hermione.

Hermione is married to Ron, and at the start of the play is Minister of Magic. She's brilliant and powerful, as expected, although I admit I was disappointed that she was in politics after all.

So the kids go back in time, and screw some stuff up, and Hermione and Ron's futures get messed up and they don't end up together.

Fine. I never liked them together.

But wait. What happens if Hermione doesn't marry Ron? She is a brilliant witch, an independent and fierce woman, so she is still wildly successful, right?

NOPE. She ends up as a Snape-like teacher, cruel to her students, bitter and angry about life, with no prospects.

WHAT. THE. HELL.

That is NOT Hermione, and the writing of one of the best female characters in fantasy did not feel like Rowling at all.

In short, save your money. This story was the worst.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

New Harry Potter book? What new Harry Potter book? I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

My gripe isn't ""oh Harry would never do that...Hermione would never say that...Well, that's not how I imagined their lives to turn out..."" No. Although there was plenty of that. Example:

""Hermione: It's become quite popular {place to visit} as a weekend break.
Draco: I can see why - look at the thatched roofs. And is that a farmer's market?""

I have news for you. Draco would never talk about the quaintness of a thatched roof or go gaga over a farmer's market. Literally the most absurd thing I've ever read.

No, the improbable dialogue wasn't what turned me off. It was that this new story lacked innovation. Lacked magic. Lacked Hagrid. Cliché in both characters and plot development. Albus Potter was a thoughtless misguided Harry. Scorpio Malfoy was a totally-not-endearing Ron. This was just bad. I mean, read it because it's the new Harry Potter. But that's it.

Rowling was able to channel bits of the original series with at least one character - Ginny still has the personality of a wet cardboard box.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

There are so many things - big and small - that do not add up with the other books at all. The characters are barely even passable as themselves and even the terms are misspoken. ""Minister for Magic""??? It's been Minister of Magic for seven books and now it changes? Even just small things like that irk me so much because it really is as though this is a poor fan fiction that Rowling felt some need to attach her name to?

The problem is that characters are shallow and unrecognisable. All of them, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Snape, even Malfoy in the end. Furthermore, the plot is simply bad, and very lazy. Instead of exploring something new, they just went back and used some old ideas, and at the same time ignored a lot of rules that had been established in the seven books. Finally the writing was not good either. I don't understand why Rowling approved of this. It really seems like the only goal was to make more money of it, and thus declare it as part of the cannon.

I'm finding it difficult to find the words.

Obligatory remarks: I have loved Harry Potter for 20 years. I'm reading the books to my daughter, I have read the 7 books more times than I can count, I have led my students in countless discussions and debates about the books over the last 15 years. I also read more Harry Potter fan fiction than is normal or healthy. I've read every possible scenario of what happens to these characters after the canon books.

I was so excited about the Cursed Child that I could barely sleep this week. I knew it was a script, I knew Jo didn't write it. But I was excited. Now, I'm bummed.

******I WILL NOW BE SUPER SPOILERY:

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

Things I liked:

-Albus is a Slytherin! Yay!! This was my one wish for this book, along with hoping Scorpius wasn't the antagonist.
-Scorpius. I'm a huge fan of all things Malfoy. Seriously, Draco Malfoy is my favorite character. I'm pleased with how Scorpius was written in the play. The rumor that he is Voldy's son? Brilliant.
-There were times when I could really see the original Ron and Ginny in their characters here. Not often, but occasionally.
-Who wouldn't like to see Snape again?
-I'm glad to see that Harry is struggling with his experiences. Let's face it, with all he's been through, he would definitely have PTSD. The epilogue in Deathly Hallows always struck me as a little too ""shiny happy.""

The disappointments:

-Time moves too quickly, and we get almost superficial glimpses of why both Albus and Scorpius are struggling in school. I would have much preferred for the story to focus more on their experiences at Hogwarts. With Rose as the antagonist with a Malfoy prejudice? That would have been great. Truly great. And unexpected.

-Slytherin. On a deep, gut level, I've needed Albus to be a Slytherin. I've always been troubled by the portrayal of Slytherin House in both the books and the movies. They are the Evil House. Why, WHY would Hogwarts condone the sorting of a quarter of the school into Death Eater training grounds? If Salazar Slytherin was so evil and essentially a racist, why does Hogwarts still have a Slytherin House? And what is the message to the students who are sorted into Slytherin? ""You're evil, kid. Enjoy being a Death Eater!""

Wasn't the takeaway in Books 1-7 that we shouldn't judge Slytherins unfairly? Draco actually saved Harry by not ""recognizing"" him at the Manor. Narcissa saved Harry by being brave enough to lie to Voldemort. Snape is by far the bravest, most extraordinary character in the series. And let's not forget Regulus Black, who knowingly sacrificed his life at a young age in order to destroy ONE Horcux and give others a chance to finish the job. Slytherin more than redeemed itself in the series. And the epilogue reinforces this when Harry tells Albus that it's okay to be in Slytherin. I knew in 2007 that Albus HAD to be a Slytherin. Surely the House system has changed by the time he goes to school? Surely Hogwarts is sorting students on their qualities and recognizing that all four Houses are valid and none are evil? Surely Hogwarts would rather abandon the House system than continue to train dark wizards in Slytherin?

Yes, in The Cursed Child, my dream came true and Albus was sorted into Slytherin. And he became best of friends with Scorpius, just like I had hoped. But there is no redemption for Slytherin to be found. The Slytherin kids continue to be jackasses, even to ""their own."" They bully Albus and Scorpius. We are never for a second shown that Albus possesses Slytherin qualities, nor are we shown that many people can possess the Slytherin traits (cunning, shrewdness, leadership skills) and still be a good person. This play just reinforces the same old Slytherin prejudices. There was an opportunity to redeem Slytherin, and it was lost. Spectacularly.

-Everyone else has said it and I will say it, too: Time-Turners. No. Just...no. There was plenty of material possible without having to revisit the ""greatest hits"" dates of the original series. How convenient that the play ends on October 31, 1981. It's Back to the Future. And not in a good way. I actually groaned when I saw the date. And again, not in a good way. Not to mention that Time-Turners have always been self-fulfilling; they are a closed loop, if you will. We've never seen them change anything. Going back in time always happened. Essentially, when you go back in time, you're only doing what you've ALREADY done. In Azkaban, Harry and Hermione always were there- they didn't change anything. They didn't change time. They just repeated what they had already done. We also have never seen anyone ""go back"" with a Time-Turner. They just catch up with the present.

Are you telling me that there are no other stories to tell? There are- fanfic is full of better ideas that don't involve traveling through time (and don't get me started on the fact that a canon Time-Turner can't travel that far back.) I was hoping this would be a Hogwarts fic, maybe interspersed with Harry dealing with his issues. Maybe even Snape wasn't dead. In canon, we never see a body after the fact, not a grave, or a funeral. A search for Snape would have made my heart so happy. But maybe I read too much fanfic. There are logical ways to make that happen, too. Draught of Living Death, always carrying Nagini's antivenin with him, etc. Or, barring that, what if Snape's portrait was included instead? Albus befriending the portrait at Hogwarts? Portrait Snape as Albus's mentor and advisor? Sign me up.

-Cedric. Where do I start with Cedric? I'll start here: how convoluted is it to imagine that Cedric living would have resulted in Harry's death and Voldy's success? There is no chance that this is where Delphi would have started, prophecy or no. No chance. If I had the ability to travel through time, and I wanted Voldemort to win, I would not start with Cedric Diggory. I would have started with convincing V not to attempt to kill Harry. (I know she gets there eventually, but it's a Plan B.) I would have traveled to another time and killed Harry. Or prevented the destruction of a Horcrux. Or talked V into changing a Horcrux into something less obvious. Or talked him out of taking Nagini to the final battle. Or corrupted Harry into joining V instead. The possibilities are endless. But saving Cedric is not on that list. It's not. It can't be defended. It's a HUGE coincidence that saving Cedric would cause him to become a Death Eater. And logically, Delphi would have not known this or even considered the possibility. The ""prophecy"" was a ridiculous, clearly last-minute addition in order to lend some credibility to going back to the Triwizard Tournament. But we know Cedric. There's not a chance that he would become a Death Eater. He's the most loyal, fair-minded character in the entire series. It's not even slightly believable.

-There's a second Time-Turner? What?? It's like the second launch device in Contact. I know I'm mentioning too much fanfic, but seriously, there are better amateur stories. And better HP time travel stories out there. JK destroyed all the Time-Turners for a reason during Order of the Phoenix. So they wouldn't ex machina the entire story. Are there really no other ideas?? Here's one: Harry being the Master of Death creates some interesting possibilities. I know he destroys the Elder Wand, but maybe he still is the Master of Death as the last owner of the Hallows? Wouldn't that be a better story? Harry discovering he can't die? Or maybe gifted with special powers from Death?

-We come to the worst of all. Voldemort has a child. Voldemort. Has. A. Child. It's hard to write that, because that's ridiculous. It's dumber than what most 12-year-old fanfic authors would come up with. It's rehashing the same old tired storylines, a problem that plagues most sequels. ""But this time, Voldy's a hot chick!"" Not to mention, the logistics of her birth are impossible to believe. This means that Bellatrix was heavily pregnant at Easter, when she tortured Hermione at the Manor. Also, who would have returned to the Manor after the final battle to find a baby? Well, logically, the Malfoys would have. So Draco should know, at the very least. If we insist on this storyline of V's baby, I would have preferred (by a LOT) that Scorpius really was Voldemort's kid. We all knew from the beginning that he wasn't, because we all just knew the story wouldn't have gone that way. What an awesome shock it might be to have Draco produce the second Time-Turner and explain that the rumors are true! And how does Scorpius deal with that? How would his friendship with Albus have progressed? How would Harry feel about his son in any kind of relationship with Voldy's kid? See? It's a more intriguing story than what we were given.

-Lack of complexity. Books 1-7 were brilliantly constructed, with hints of what was to come almost from the beginning. The Cursed Child is not complex. There is no challenge. I love reading to my 7-year-old and exploring those complexities in the first 7 books. It's work for her, but ultimately worth it. TCC is formulaic and lacking the depth and cleverness of the originals. Hermione puts simple riddles on her bookshelf to hide the Time-Turner? Really? That's only one example!

-I know that this next point is the ultimate fanfic reader hang-up. Let's face it: everyone's gay in fanfic. But I believe I know why, or at least why I enjoy it. Fanfic is the best chance to see how little changes might affect a well-known story and well-known characters. What if Harry were sorted into Slytherin? What if Voldemort didn't bring Nagini to the final battle? What if Lily died but James didn't? What if Sirius didn't go after Peter in '81 and had the chance to raise Harry? These sorts of hypothetical situations are the cornerstone of good fanfic. And they are why fanfic exists, to be honest- to see the ripples in the pond that little changes can make. I think this is why everyone is gay in fanfic. It brings up some interesting ideas: If Harry had a crush on Draco, how would that have affected Sixth Year? Or if Harry had been in a relationship with Cedric, how would that have changed the Triwizard Tournament? Would he have personally tried to save Cedric after the fact? Love and relationships are the big, pivotal plot points in most stories on the planet. Changing relationships up helps us see different possibilities in a well-worn story. It's a fun exercise!

I say the above because I want you all to be aware that I am not some fanfic-crazy woman who wants all the characters to be gay. I just like the mental exercise of imagining how little changes affect the entire story. When I heard that the Cursed Child would be about Albus, and then I saw the pictures of Scorpius, I pretty instantly hoped first that they would be friends, and then I wondered how them being more than friends could affect the characters (Harry and Draco can handle being civil, but could they be in-laws?) And I almost got my wish. Scorpius seemed to have deeper feelings. It is expressly written that he has issues with Albus flirting with Delphi. That he was jealous. I know Dumbledore is gay. But come on- they can't be afraid to insinuate that at least a few people in the wizarding world are gay. Statistically, many of them should be. At least leave it ambiguous, like with Dumbledore. Instead, they have to include at the very end that Scorpius likes Rose. Rose, the least interesting character in the whole damn play. And that's saying something.

Final Thoughts:
I suspect that the play itself is spectacular. The acting, the costumes, the sets, the special effects, all of them are most likely breathtaking and divert from the plot issues. But reading just the script exposes all the issues. We have no opportunity to be distracted by the spectacle. That's why I think releasing this was a huge mistake.

I'm worried that this has tainted the first books for me. I don't want to read Goblet of Fire and picture Albus and Scorpius (and Scorpius 2) there during all three tasks. Ultimately, this story adds nothing, only subtracts. There must be literally thousands of stories in the wizarding world to tell. I'm so disappointed that JK signed off on a story that included Time-Turners, events from Books 1-7, and Voldemort 2. It's poorly-constructed fanfic that we now are forced to accept as canon.

I wish this all hadn't happened. I was enjoying picturing what the whole gang was doing now. Now that I know, I wish I didn't know. I'm going to go back to better stories. I'm going to eat my feelings and pretend it didn't end like this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Where I expected an open window to Harry's adult world, I saw a rash, selfish, and cowardly shell of the Harry we loved so dearly. Hermione is still a know-it-all, but she is no longer clever, nor kind, nor motherly. Ron is still the side kick, but he's stupid, lazy, and a drunkard. What happened here?

I'll answer that: homie wrote some serious garbage.

Let me clarify: I studied Theatre for four years and have read countless plays. The script format did not hinder my ability to understand or visualize the story in its complexity. And that's just it: there was almost no complexity.

The characters did not speak eloquently or meaningfully; they all spoke like 30 year olds texting their friends in 2016. The plot was more of a stream of the author's consciousness, and was not well-founded. Twists and turns and surprises (which don't add up) pollute every other page, and it muddies the message-- they seem more like ""fun"" ideas the author had than intentional constructions. A single, central theme would be hard to pinpoint. The story was bad, the characters were bad, and the ending was bad. Even if this weren't Harry Potter, it would have been bad.

TL;DR: This was just a poorly written fanfic that got published.

SPOILERS:

The story really was hard to believe. Albus Potter, son of two excellent Quidditch players and gifted wizards, can't even UP a broom? Scorpius Malfoy, son of a former Death Eater, was the cheeriest, purest, blood-traitorest character in the story? And I find it very hard to believe that Cedric Diggory would have turned Death Eater simply from humiliation. In fact, I would find it hard to believe of him in any circumstance. This book is a disgrace to his fictional memory.

What's up with the terrible relationship between Harry and Albus? Sure, nobody likes to be in friends' or family's shadows, but how did they make it 16 years as enemies? Harry would have to REALLY not care about his son for it to get that far. And we all know Harry isn't like that. One of the dearest desires of Harry's heart is to have a family.

As far as the Bellatrix + Moldy Voldy goes... uh. I get it, okay? She clearly had some weird sexual thing going on for him. But she was actively fighting throughout the entire 7th book, and her pregnancy was conveniently never mentioned. What's more is that Hermione became her via Polyjuice Potion, and I don't think that's really a thing for pregnant moms. Sorry, but this simply didn't happen. There's no way.

And can we cool it with the all-of-history-has-been-changed thing? You can only change all of history, like, once and back again. Any more than that should be against the rules. While we're on that, let's also agree that Time Turners can only take you back X hours depending on the number of turns you give them, and that jamming on them doesn't take you back mysteriously to the exact 25 years prior that you want.

I know I'm not the only one who thought some guy thought to himself ""What if.... <insert crazy fanfic idea here>... happened?"" and wrote it as a character's line. And then did it again. And then did it again. And then did it again enough times to have scrapped together an entire, [crappy] play, and then got JK Rowling to sign off on it (confunded, no doubt), and then got it performed and published.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I had already paid for the book before I realized it was a screenplay with other writers. I cannot imagine why Rowling put her name on this. I'm one of those people who have been at all the midnight releases of the books. I am just flabbergasted with this book. Clearly my expectations were too much. I expected much more development and background of the characters. Even Albus and Scorpious- the main characters- aren't given proper treatment. Perhaps this is an acceptable play... I don't know. It's terrible in book form. I want to completely forgot I ever read it.
SPOILERS

Am I really supposed to believe Voldermort shacked up with Bellatrix at the Malfoy's and produced a love child????

Why do Albus and Scorpious have to constantly verify that they are indeed best friends?

The time-turners? Really?

Dumbledore is an emotional, bubbling fool?

Harry is just a shell of a man who can't make any of his own decisions and needs to be bossed around by Ginny??

It would have been a complete waste of money.  The best I can say about it is that it's an easy read, and I only ended up wasting about 2 hours of my life.

The basic outline of the story had potential, but it was not fleshed out well, and the personality of the returning characters was entirely different.  Harry neglects his family, Hermione is dumb, Ginny is now a wishy-washy Mrs. Weasley, Ron's constantly cracking jokes, and Draco is coming really close to being nice (I found him to be the most believable)
And then we get to the new characters... Who have exactly zero character development.  They are entirely one dimensional.  Albus has something to prove, Scorpius is kind, they're friends just with eachother, and that's about all that can be said about them. It was obvious who the ""real"" villian was, there were gaping plot holes near the end (apparently the authors forgot  how a fidelius charm is supposed to work).

This play was a bitter disappointment. I knew it was a play, and I have no problem with that format. But there was little to nothing enjoyable about this reading experience. I honestly wish I had never read it. The characters are poorly written. The characters we know and love- Harry, Hermoine, Ron- are poor imposters of themselves. Ron is portrayed more or less like a bumbling idiot. Hermoine is conceited and shallow. Harry is a mere shadow of the man he should be. I don’t care if Harry Potter didn’t know his dad- I can’t imagine him so self-absorbed that he can’t figure out how to parent, and that is how he is portrayed in this book. And it’s not just the characters we loved... it’s the characters we loved to hate. Spoiler alert: Draco Malfoy confesses he never saw himself as a powerful ministry person... he just wanted to be a professional quidditch player and be happy. Barf!! Snape, when confronted with those who know he was really good all along, takes up the torch and plays the hero. Yeah.... no. The whole idea that Voldemort had a child... and by Bellatrix Lestrange?!?... is laughable. We’re supposed to believe that while he was plotting to get rid of Harry Potter once and for all, Voldemort took time out to impregnate Bellatrix, and she had the baby in the Malfoy mansion before the battle of Hogwarts? It’s honestly insulting to anyone who actually read the real books. I honestly cannot think of anything I liked about this story. The characters were poorly fleshed out, the dialogue was cheesy, the story was weak. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I sincerely wish I had never read this book- let alone purchased it.

I started reading them back in 1998 and the books and movies absolutely defined my teenage years. When this came out I was disappointed that it was a screenplay instead of a book, but I was willing to look past that. I was also willing to look past the fact that there were multiple authors, because at least JK Rowling was one of them.

So, like most Potter fans I was thirsty for more Potter, and bought this book the day it came out to start reading it. I noticed immediately that this is not Harry Potter. This feels like a half baked fanfic written by someone who watched the first two movies and then stopped caring about Harry Potter until they were asked to write this ten years later. Nothing makes sense. They even start with a scene that was ALREADY written and managed to mess it up. They change things all over the place, and it's honestly just a story that never needed to be told. There are so many tales in the Potter universe that would be amazing to read about and watch.

This is a prime example of ""Be careful what you wish for"" and ""Sometimes more is not better"".

If you haven't purchased this, do yourself a favor and just re-read the original series and be happy with that. JK Rowling is done with Potter for now.

Step away from the computer-don't do it! Don't you do it! Now I wish I had a Time Turner. I told myself-I swore to myself that I would not buy this play. I reasoned, argued and rationalized why I shouldn't get sucked in to this obvious Ponzi scheme of literature. But did I listen? NO! In a moment of weakness, I caved. I'm not proud of myself, but so it goes. Now that I had this $15.00 folly on my Kindle, I had to read it. I repeat UGH! It is so wrong on soooooooo many levels, but at the end of the day, it's just not a good story. All I know is that unless you want to see Harry being cut off of sugar for a month by Ginny and Draco Malfoy as a sad sack, stay away! You will not unearth one gratifying thing about the future Potters-if anything, you will find them insipid. All of the wonderfulness that made these characters beloved has been eradicated or ignored. The only thing that could have made it worse is if it were a musical. Oh, and lyrics were included-yeah that would be worse than a stint in Azkaban. Further, I am greatly disappointed that Rowling approved this piece of (insert noun of choice here). Her writing is so meticulous and thoughtful, and this was drivel. I hate to say it, but I feel like she owes everyone who spent money on this a new, real book, because this one is bloody awful.

No, not because it was a play. But because it destroyed the integrity of characters that were so artfully crafted. It was terrible.
SPOLIERS (lets be honest the whole book is a spoiler... of the original series):
- my biggest issue is that Voldemort would NEVER have signed off on an heir. He had no intention of ever dying, and believed himself to be above it. He would have cast Avada Kedavra on any death eater that suggested and heir. GTFOH.
- Cedric Diggory was the best kind of person and they turned him into a death eater?! Are you kidding me?! Disgusting.
- destroyed the integrity of the original 3: Harry Ron and Hermione... completely went against who they were. I can’t even.

It is part of the canon of a major literary franchise I’ve been following for the last 20 years, and I did read it, but I have a pretty strict anti-book-bashing rule. As I know from experience, authors work very hard on their books, and negative reviews crush souls. But, in the name of fairness and transparency, these playwrights aren’t really authors, and they’re never going to read this review, so…

I was very disappointed in this script. I’m about as upset that this was allowed to happen as I am about the Fantastic Beasts movie franchise – which is the George Lucas-ification of my beloved childhood series before my very eyes – but that’s another topic for another time. “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a stageplay about an adult Harry Potter and his Slytherin son, Albus Severus. Having had a crummy childhood himself, with few decent father figures, Harry struggles with how to be a good dad to a son he doesn’t quite understand. Young Albus can’t stand living in his famous father’s shadow, and takes refuge in a somewhat forbidden friendship with Scorpius Malfoy, the son of his father’s school-hood enemy, Draco.

*HERE THERE BE SPOILERS*
I’m not complaining about the above premise. What was cheap and silly was that the entire plot was Albus and Scorpius using a Time-Turner to go back in time – to the Triwizard Tournament, to the night Voldemort tried to kill Harry as a baby – essentially, to events we’ve already seen in the books. Nothing fresh, nothing new. Nothing even remotely creative. Just taking us to past events we already know all about and, in the process, retroactively ruining the series. They also show some alternative outcomes, such as if Snape had survived and Voldemort had won the Battle at Hogwarts. It was worse than fan fiction, purely speculative, with zero storytelling effort or originality. As a writer, I can’t decide whether this kind of laziness on such a grand scale saddens or outrages me. Some of us have invested our entire adolescences into this franchise (*awkwardly raises hand*). And this is the thanks we get?!

The writing was bad. The dialogue was bad. The plot was bad. The entire experience was overall so awful, I kept reading only because I was curious to see if it was possible that the ending could hit below rock-bottom, and truly disappoint me any more than I was already disappointed. The idea that Cedric Diggory – whose death was such a significant turning point in the series because he was so good, decent and innocent – would’ve turned into an evil Death Eater had he lived, is appalling and goes against the spirit of the original story. In the words of Lucius Malfoy: It’s a disgrace to the name of wizard.

If you are, or ever were, a fan of the Harry Potter series, I’d advise you to stay far away from this “book”. Certainly don’t waste your money. Read it in one sitting at your library or bookstore if you absolutely must, but it’s truly not worth the time or the damage it will do to your feelings toward the series and its author’s (lack of) integrity.

POST SCRIPT: If you want to read a fan fiction script about Albus Potter that’s actually good, I’d recommend “Albus Potter and the Founders’ Fountain” by Evilolive. You can listen to the performance by The Leaky Cauldron Acting Troupe on the archives of PotterCast podcast, episodes 177, 182, 187, 193, 202 and 203. *I have no affiliation with the writer(s) or podcast; I was simply a listener of the pod way back in the day and enjoyed that story far more than I enjoyed “Cursed Child”.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Don't waste your time or money.","Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2016","I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  Huge.  I've read every book of the series several times.  This is NOT #8 in the series. I wish I could say that it was a visit with old friends, but it wasn't. I think JK Rowling lost her mind when she endorsed this drivel.  I stopped reading it at 7% because I hated it, but then I went back to it.  I should have left it.

It was bad fan fiction.  I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.  It was disjointed and written terribly, and that had nothing to do with the fact that it was written as a play.  The grammar was awful.  Nothing was explained.  This was the stupidest thing I've ever read, and I have read Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey, and lots of fan fiction.

Hermoine was not believable as the Minister OF Magic (they kept calling it the Minister FOR Magic). Harry was an awful father, just annoying, and a very weak character. Ginny was not the spit fire she is supposed to be. Ron was an oaf and not one bit funny. Albus was an ass. The only characters I liked were Draco and Scorpious. Draco was how I wanted him to be when he grew up.

The discourse between Harry and Dumbledore is ridiculous and stupid.  Dumbledore crying in his portrait?  Give me a break.

As for that pregnancy, there is no way that Draco would not have known about it, and I didn't get the impression that he was lying. But then, since nothing else was explained, maybe he was lying.

In this ""book,"" polyjuice potion can be made instantly instead of over a course of one month, and third years are taught about the patronus charm.  Those two are just two examples of how this deviated from the original series.

This entire thing was rubbish.

The author of this hasn't read the books and either doesn't know how to write, or hasn't had a relationship with a human being before. They took HUGE chunks of the original books and just shoved it into the script. It isn't even a nod, it's just using it as filler. The story was one dimensional. The characters were lifeless. The characters only resemblance to their original form is their name. It makes the reader feel stupid. I don't need to be spoon fed information. I just saw someone use a time turner. I don't need Harry Potter to say 'I think he just traveled through time.' And there are a number of things that happened that just left me wondering who looked at this and said, 'Perfect! Let's publish this!'

Spoilers:

In this alternate reality where this all takes place...

Polyjuice potion takes a day to create.

The candy lady on the Hogwarts Express has claws and prevents kids from leaving the train.

Fred and George both must have died because we hear of every other single character except them, and Ron owns the joke shop now.

Without Ron as a husband, Hermoine would be an unsufferable lonely wench.

Bellatrix Lestrange must have hidden her pregnancy well.

And Hermione hides things with lame riddles and  has become dumb with age.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Like many other reviewers, I am a true fan, and have loved all things Potter. The basic premise of this story was intriguing, but the writing, particularly the dialogue, is just so poor. Yes, I know it's a play, and based in the stage direction, I would imagine the effects are stunning in the theater, but the Potter canon has always been about the characters. The trite dialogue simply leaves them flat. Worse: there is no true humor in this story, other than using Ron as some sort of slapstick comic relief. (I don't remember Ron being as clumsy or unintelligent as this character is drawn.)  Many of the plot devices are recycled from other media, as well. The whole story with the underground movement came straight from the last Shrek movie, although it does explain some of the casting choices. The most incongruous of these devices is the idea that Delphi is the love child of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Unless Voldemort raped Bellatrix as some kind of punishment, the idea of his being intimate with anyone directly contradicts his whole purpose. He would also be super careful NOT to have progeny, as he would not want to be attached to anything. Voldemort is a creature that expects to live forever as the most powerful being: he does not want attachments or competition. When reading this, I could see the dramatic visual appeal, but. in the end, I could not get past how the dialogue seemed to be lifted straight from a badly written made for tv Disney movie. These characters are British, yet their slang is too American. There is simply too little Rowling here.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Gilmore","I've also seen all the movies repeatedly and accepted the disappointment over them not mirroring the books enough","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2017","First of all this is my hubby's account. I've read and reread the books and was really looking forward to this book. I was willing to accept that it was a play and was really excited to get it. I've also seen all the movies repeatedly and accepted the disappointment over them not mirroring the books enough, but I lived with it and enjoyed them.

I preordered this book and like others excitedly waited for it's release. Then it gets here and I read it.

I'm not going to fully break down all of the disappointments in it, but say I whole hardly agree with most of the things that folks had to say about it.

The story itself didn't have that HP feel to it. It just felt rushed. The main plot idea of the story goes against the original ideas and character understanding or our understanding of the characters. I know people can change as the grow up, but some of it was just too much.

Now, the plot itself if they'd done it differently, but the person they used was impossible based on the original stories.

Macaulay","Is ANY Harry Potter Better Than NO Harry Potter? Probably Not. (CONTAINS SPOILERS!)","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","I'm not going to write a long review. Others have already done an excellent job of pointing out the horrific mess that's been made of our beloved Wizarding World.

* * * * * S P O I L E R S  B E L O W * * * * *

Like many other reviewers, I have loved JK's creation for many years. Some have said I'm obsessed. However, this script's plot and its holes are astoundingly poorly conceived. Here are a few of the most egregious.

1. That's not how time turners work.
2. Voldemort had sex with Bellatrix? Come on.
3. Cedric becomes a Death Eater after a single humiliation? Seriously?
4. Why tease a possible romantic relationship between Albus and Scorpius if it's not followed through?
5. Hermione's carnivorous bookcase and riddles were beyond ridiculous.
6. The characters do not speak or act like the ones that were written by JK, and pretty faithfully realized in the films.
7. Who raised Delphi, and how would Scorpius
not know about her?

There's more, but I'll stop there. I will regard this script not as canon, but as poorly written fan fiction that takes place in an alternate wizarding universe where the Hogwarts Express trolley witch is actually a Terminator.  If JK ever decides to rewrite this herself, I would, of course, read it. But, I'll never read an HP book by another author, expecting the continuity, characterization, and cleverness that were in books 1-7.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_169?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=169&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This was NOT written by JK Rowling and anyone who believes so is a genuine bloody idiot.

Second. I was unable to read further than the third chapter of the ""book"", it was so appallingly awful.

Third. I wanted this. I wanted this just as badly as every other Harry Potter fan. I pre-ordered it, reread all the books before it came it, rewatched all the movies, and spent months fantasizing and speculating what the Cursed Child would be about.

Third. This is biggest blindside and letdown I've ever gotten from a book before. You'd think that being the ""8th book"" the first chapter at the train station would be exactly that of the 19 years later epilogue in the Deathly Hallows, yes? No. Completely different. Apparently Teddy Lupin, Victoire Weasley, and Hugo Weasley no longer exist. Rose has a severe attitude problem, James is a ghost, Albus is put in Slytherin when he had been dying to be in Gryffindor??, and Hermione is a ""Granger-Weasley""... sorry. Just in those first few chapters was enough to make me cry and return the book the very next day without finishing it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

At times, Albus and Scorpius act and sound years older than their parents.  Shabby attempts to insert humor fell flat while frantic action scenes reminded me of those I have seen in poorly directed Chinese Kung- Fu movies.

Even more disturbing is that all the critics' accolades remind me of the old ""Emperor's New Clothes"" Tale.  Everyone praising something absurd for fear of being criticized by the people around them.  Have we really become so desperate for another chapter in Harry's life that we'll settle for whatever is thrown at us?

For me,  this is a prime example of greedy moguls in the movie industry (because of course a movie is going to be in the  works eventually,...  with the probable addition of a talking pet sidekick... a la Donkey or Jiminy cricket)  twisting old beloved traditional fairytales into scenes of dancing,  singing mice and teapots that talk, while bullying their target market into agreeing with so-called experts who are actually secretly  profiting in some way from promoting the offered dribble.

That Rowling put her seal of approval on this  play shocks me. For me,  Harry's adventure ends firmly on platform 9 3/4 as he sends Albus off to Hogwarts.

My dad read me the books and I fully intend on reading the books to my children. Not this one, though. It breaks my heart. It is so bad, I would give it negative stars if I could.

Let me start by saying that I hated the epilogue at the end of book 7. JK should have never written it; the names that she gave to Harry's children are cheesy and lame, pairing up the couples like she did left so little to the imagination. She should have just let it end.

That's where this comes in; the Cursed Child shows that JK doesn't seem to care about her fans, more like the amount of money her franchise is making. There was little to no character development throughout the play - even with the characters we know and love! The plot is terribly constructed with SO many holes in it. Poorly edited, as well. Spelling and grammatical errors abound. I understand that this play is probably very quite captivating on stage with special effects and superb acting, however this DOES NOT translate well into print. I can't stress that enough. Any action is not developed well enough; I had a hard time following large parts that weren't dialogue.

~~~~~SPOILERS BELOW~~~~~

The biggest problems I had:
- Throughout the script, parts of dialogue are lifted from the books. This happens so often that it is redundant. Unoriginal.
- Dumbledore and Harry's conversation seemed so surface, emotions so forced. Dumbledore crying, really? Harry talking about Daddy issues? No. Dumbledore's appearance was unnecessary and annoying.
- Everything so conveniently falls into the hands of Albus and Scorpius. Need gillyweed? No problem! Polyjuice potion? Can be concocted in a minute, when in Chamber of Secrets it is clear that it takes a month to brew. Bathilda Bagshots house with the doors unlocked? Perfect. Draco Malfoy just *happening* to have an extra timeturner? PLEASE. Give me a break.
- Voldemorts daughter. It doesn't work! Everyone would have known if Bellatrix was pregnant, that's not something she could have just hidden. Ridiculous.

There's so much more but I don't want to go on because, just like reading this book, it's a complete waste of my time. I hate JK Rowling for endorsing this pathetic piece of fanfiction. Oh yeah - she didn't write the book, which is misleading for readers seeing that her name is so huge on the cover. Don't buy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Scorpius and Albus constantly whinging about whether it's OK to hug, Hermione and Ron pulling apart so no one sees them kissing (they're MARRIED!), Harry vacillating between asking advice and ignoring it ... oh, the drama, the anxiety, the hand-wringing! It's as if they not only haven't grown or developed since we last saw them, but have regressed. It isn't due to being presented in ""play"" form; I can read a play and envision the emotions and descriptions that are left out. It's due to the terrible character ""development"" (of which there is very little) and the way in which beloved characters (Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, etc.), who were developed lovingly and extensively over 7 previous books, suddenly act like whiny babies, or broadly comedic fools, or over-sensitive children instead of adults. Professor McGonagall, one of my favorite characters in the ""real"" books, loses her sternness, her sense of fairness, her common sense, and comes off as vacillating and foolish. Dumbledore seems to be suffering from old age dementia, with his bumbling ""advice"" and teariness. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and fully expected to love and cherish this book. Instead I HATED it. I refuse to even add it to my Harry Potter bookshelf, but instead donated it to my local library. What a stunning disappointment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I do not consider it part of the series.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

They failed. This is not an original story about the adventures of the next generation of wizards/witches, but a poorly developed story built around a mashup of the highlights from the original series. I actually had to walk away from the book on several occasions because I became so annoyed with their poor depiction of original characters. There were also several parts/twists of the story that I felt were not believable because they did not coincide with the details/explanations we know from the original series, i.e. Delphi's parents, Harry's lack of knowledge about Dumbledore's feelings, etc. I love the Harry Potter series, but regret ruining it with this story.

- The Actors are great
- The Play execution is excellent
- The dialogues are well done
- The characterizations are decent
- The story is very emotional
- And the plot is AWFUL!

But since this is only a script, it can no longer hide behind great actors and producers. The plot itself can be best called 'Back to the Future 2 On Steroid"" or ""Time-Turner Extravaganza"". So many plot elements contradict the original 7 Books it's not even funny anymore. If you absolutely want to read it though, wait until your library has a copy or browse it at your local bookstores.

There are some bright spots, such as Scorpius' character, Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione relationships, but they can't save the overall train wreck plot.

These books came out as I was growing up. I aged with the Trio. I stood in line for midnight book releases. I WANTED to like this. I really did! But....I don't. I really did not enjoy it. With it's script format, it was a quick read in a single afternoon. That wasn't an issue for me as I'm familiar with script format. It was the story itself that got to me. It felt like it took all the happiness of the original books and epilogue, pulled it out of you, threw it in the mud, stomped on it, and shoved the mess back in where your fond memories were. It is not fun. It is depressing. It feels more like crappy fanfiction rather than a JK Rowling story. The fact that she is not the sole writer is very clear here. I really wonder how much she contributed herself beyond checking it over and putting her name on it. There were cannon errors and characters acted out of their norm (even given the fact they are now adults). Honestly, if I could Obliviate this from my memory and end with book 7, I'd be happy. It changes your reflection on the original books.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

That's the best word I can come up with.  The story was contrived and a tad absurd.  The dialogue was weak.  The characters were changed.  Moaning Myrtle...that was the hardest to swallow.  Really!?!?  Malfoy, Ron and Dumbledore where also unrecognizable.  I wonder if these guys even read the books?  It seemed like they intentionally made the adult characters lame so the 2 young protagonist would stand out more.  If that was the case they failed miserably.

This is an insult to not only Potter fans but what J.K. Rowling created as a series. Reading this there is no trace of her style at all. It's clear that 2 men with a few of her notes and ideas about future installments wrote this piece of dungbomb. I knew this would be in a script format but upon reading it, it steals from ones ability to imagine what's going on around the characters. Without giving away too many spoilers it's a bad sign when the writing feels lazy and predictable once we get the main plot kicked off. It doesn't speak well for your antagonist if their whole plan revolves around the restoration/resurrection of the previous one. Just makes them come off as weak villain. Characters we grew to know and love should still maintain some of those elements but evolved to fit the fact that they've got careers and families of their own. THAT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND HERE. Many of the characters we grew to love the previous 7 books come off as missing a piece or two of themselves. We're not given much time to get to know any new characters other than Albus Potter. Everyone else is pretty much show and tell with no actual development to speak of. Harry Potter books when you break it down are mysteries wrapped in fantasy. All 7 previous books had a mystery or two for the trio to solve along the way. Cursed Child thinks it's this but it's just a badly disguised time travel book lazily wrapped in fantasy. So many missteps in this book that there are dancers with two left feet doing a better job of hitting their steps. This story's premise of Albus wanting to get out of the shadow cast by his father Harry had all kinds of potential. Sadly it just wastes and squanders it to no end that it's painful. I find myself hoping for a comic book level or ret-con on this or to learn it takes place in some strange alternate pocket universe. This is an insult to the canon of the wizarding world we have come to know and love since the 90s.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In fact, this book never should have existed, I think that part of the reason the book was so bad was that they were scrambling for a villain. The Deathly Hallows ended with the words ""All was well."" If they really wanted to give us more content, they should've wrote a Marauder's prequel, and by they I mean J.K.

I've also read a lot of fanfiction for this series. This will be important.

Potterverse Trivia: Did you know that the Italians have been fairly open about their magical population since the Renaissance? Because some of the greatest political dynasties across the Iberian peninsula were made up of both “Amagia” (Muggles) and Wizards, the existence of a magically-endowed sect of the population was something of an open secret, all the way through the 1800s. These same dynasties were responsible for starting the Patria Dei Academia for young Wizards and Witches in the late 15th century, with one house for each of the families who participated: Medici, Borgia, Sforza, and Gonzaga. The Patria Dei Academia was one of the first of its kind, and served as a model for Wizarding Schools worldwide; it still operates to this day.

 I just made that up! Did you see how easy it was? With all the potential behind Harry Potter’s universe, it should not be hard to write a good Harry Potter story, especially not for the original author. Yet a good Harry Potter story, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not.

 Some background is in order. As an official continuation of the Harry Potter series, Cursed Child was hyped into the stratosphere by fans. Sure, it was a play and not a novel, and sure, the casting choices caused controversy, but none of those factors could deflate fans’ enthusiasm for J.K. Rowling’s next chapter in the series. Except, as it turned out, it wasn’t Rowling’s work at all, instead being penned by one Jack Thorne. Thorne’s previous credits include Skins, a soap-operatic look at the lives of dysfunctional West End teenagers, and other works you probably haven’t heard of. Bear that in mind when you read the play, because the cover tries to convince you that J.K. Rowling actually wrote it.

  With that out of the way, where do we even begin? The story focuses on Harry Potter’s angsty prune of a son, Albus Severus Potter, who suffers from middle child syndrome like Mary Mallon suffered from typhoid fever. He’s angsty about the prospect of being sorted into Slytherin, which – of course – he is. This alienates him from his childhood friend Rose Granger-Weasley, a brat devoid of any redeeming features whose appearance in-story is mercifully brief. However, it does give him a new friend in Draco Malfoy’s adorkable son Scorpius, who provides most of the story’s mounting homoerotic subtext. In the meantime, old characters are scooped out into unlikeable and soulless shells of their former selves, drama is forced down the audience’s throats, and nobody has a pleasant time. Speaking of time, there is time travel involved.

 So, in case you couldn’t tell, this is Rowling writing her own fanfiction. The “dream team” – really the Unforgivable Curses – of Rowling, Thorne, and director John Tiffany liberally ape ideas that Potter fans have appropriated ever since the last book’s release. Albus and Harry have a strained relationship because of Harry’s reputation? Check. Albus ends up sorted into Slytherin and becomes a whinging angst melon? Check. Albus befriends Scorpius and sets the hearts of shippers aflutter? Check. Ron and his family are cast unfairly as unsympathetic twits? Check. A silver-haired Manic Pixie Dream Witch who steals the heart of our young protagonist? Check. Time travel to fix Harry’s mistakes (well, one mistake)? Check, then go back and check again! On their own, most of these are not bad things, and fans have been using them for years. When jammed haphazardly into a single story just so they’re all in there, like the world’s worst game of Tetris, they amount to an annoying pile of blocks.

 Bad ideas are one way to kill a story, but the Terrible Trio ensured a dirt nap with their ridiculous execution. Most lines in the play suffer from unnecessary verbiage, more in need of pruning than the Forbidden Forest. You could shave at least a third of the book just by removing unneeded words. Worse than what they include, though, is what they omit. Albus’s first three years of Hogwarts are glossed over in graceless montage, as if to indicate the playwright had an idea of things that could happen, but gave up and got plastered on Butterbeer. When the time travel plot kicks off, it focuses on saving a tertiary character, Cedric Diggory, by eliminating him from the Triwizard Tournament. This is as opposed to, say, giving Dumbledore a list of all the Horcruxes and preventing the entire second Wizarding War. The best way to describe their goal is “tangential”, and even that is putting it gently.

 In fact, the whole logic of Cursed Child is questionable at best, and at worst slips down the proverbial stairs and hits its head on every step. A key plot point early in the piece involves rumors surrounding poor Scorpius’s parentage. What are these rumors, you ask? Well, the prevailing word is that Draco was infertile, so he sent his wife back in time via Time-Turner to be impregnated by You-Know-Who, resulting in Scorpius. To reiterate: Scorpius is Voldermort’s son because of time travel. The entire Wizarding World takes this rumor at face value.

 …Erm, Mr. Thorne, do you think you could have given Scorpius a dramatic backstory without making literally every other Witch and Wizard look like a tinfoil-hatted dunce?!

 “No can do, I’m too busy trying to drink my weight in Butterbeer!”

 There are other plot twists in the book, nearly all of them as insipid and poorly thought-out, but I won’t spoil them for those of you not put off by this review.

 The play does have its good points, ironically related to its Slytherin cast. Snape appears in an alternate universe caused by time-shenanigans (Spoiler Alert!), and I’m happy to report that he is as dynamic, emotionally complex, and courageous as ever. He might have been the only character the team actually put thought into. Draco also goes through a character arc which makes him sympathetic without losing too much of his dignity, and his son is the best part of most of the play. Also, the unholy trinity use the Trolley Witch, an incidental character at best, in an interesting way that basically makes her the Potterverse equivalent of Silent Hill 2’s Pyramid Head. Her scene is one of the best, and most imaginative, in the whole trainwreck of a script.

 Overall, it’s ambiguous as to who the titular Cursed Child is, but the book is a curse unto itself. Not only does it disappoint the expectations of loyal fans, it derails existing canon and fails to capture the magic that made the series special. There are only so many things that can be done with the core cast and their slice of the Wizarding World, but this monstrous book of monotony should not have been one of them. With Fantastic Beasts just on the horizon, and Rowling actually writing its script, your money would be better saved on tickets for that.

The way this book trampled over the original series was in a way horrifying. Taking something I truly love and manipulating it to create a dumb story about even dumber kids. It becomes very hard to believe that Harry would have a child so dumb.

Many people told me to read this as if it was a fan fiction to help improve my opinion of it, but it didn't work. I find it hard to believe a true fan would create a story that would so manipulate the original material.

I am fine with that, what isn't fine is the fact that the whole thing makes no sense. SPOILERS AHEAD. Alowing for the fact that we are to believe that Voldemort had a child with Bellatrix and that she woud have very recently given birth to said child before the Battle of Hogwarts. As well as the notion that there is a new time turner that will propel you back to your own time. Looking past those issues the time travel question and solution at Godric's Hollow makes no sense what so ever. In order for the boys to get a hold of the blanket they would have to make sure events transpire correctly therefore solving the problem.
With the introduction of a new prophesy I had assumed the writter was going to make Volemorets daughter misenterpret her role. She could have been the unknown child and lead her father to his downfall. Instead it is forgotten and suppossedly unfullfilled meaning all prophesies are avoidable and Harry, even after chosen by Voldemort, didn't have to face him. Thus making alot of talk between Dumbledore and Harry pointless.
Lastly, I just want to say that Draco was the only decent and semi-compitent adult in the entire thing. Harry hadn't grown since year 7, Ginny became pointless just like Ron, and Hermione was only good for holding meetings and being really bad at her job. Draco suffered, lost his wife, trying to rebuild his family name after his father, and constently begged Harry to say something about terrible rumors going around about his son.

Rowling at the bottom.

I know I did.

You get this tome home, it undulates wickedly in your hands. A new story! A new format? Whatever, Rowling has never written anything we didn't like. No matter the waling sound drifting from the pages...

So you start into it and immediately your favourite characters are there. Only it isn't them. None of their mannerisms are left intact. Magic doesn't work like it should. Every single character, be it man or woman, adult or child, minister or muggle, talks like the same depressed adult trying to put on a brave face just to meet his deadline.

You slam the cover shut, your eyes streaming with tears. How? How could she do this?

Then you see it. She didn't write it.

Oh no. You've bought fanfiction. You've PAID for FANFICTION. Badly written to boot!

But I'd forgive it all - ALL OF IT - if I got the slightest inkling that Thorne was actually a fan. Or had read the books.
Any of them!
Instead, the whole book seems to be written from the point of view of someone who spent an evening watching the Goblet of Fire movie and spent the rest of the evening in the Harry Potter wiki. If this is true, I would invite Mr Thorne to read the following entries more closely:

[...]
[...]
[...]

Now, yes, there are a few folks here dismissing the problems because the series was meant for children. Which is insane. The cultural footprint of the series ought to back me up, though, honestly, I think C.S. Lewis beat me to anything I could say with this little gem:
""...When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.""

Anywho, if you're still with me, I find it only polite to inform you that the spoilers are gonna start here and I'm gonna just start listing the parts that made me angry.

That's it, stop reading here if you still are going to read it and want nothing spoilt (though, admittedly, spoiling something already rancid isn't all that terrible, is it?)

Very well. I thank you in advance for your patience.

Right, so the character development that happened in the actual novels is gone. It's not here anymore. So Hermione is dull-witted and useless. Ron has become an alcoholic and for some reason a surly Fred-replacement. Harry doesn't seem to have any memory of coming to terms with Dumbledore's past, of his decision to save Draco and the mutual respect that developed, or of his childhood circumstances. I mean, maybe our hero underwent a massive stroke and refused treatment at St Mungo's. Also, Voldemort - who I'll remind everyone is basically a Lich - had sex (and I'm gonna just clarify that he is not ""alive"" per se, but essentially ""undead"") with Bellatrix (with Rodolfus' approval no less) in order to generate the book's personal antagonist. What is the purpose? A wizard chooses undeath just so that he doesn't need children! That's the whole point! He's immortal now!

When they start changing time, it gets worse. The author seems to have a thing for the Butterfly Effect and had things like Ron marrying Padma and Cedric Diggory becoming a Death Eater. Finally, our ponderous playwright engineers a scene in which Harry watches his parents get murdered! I might have been engaged - and thus disgusted - but this bloke forgot to explain how any of our erstwhile Time Lords manage to see straight through the Fidelius Charm that I guess just got ret-conned straight out of cannon by this mangy pile of ink and paper.

I suppose the problem, when you just get down to it, is that this reads like Doctor Who fanfiction and not Harry Potter. Indeed, you could name the characters literally anything else and the story would not change a bit. This feels like a personal story, one the author wanted to get out but could not get it published because, frankly, the dialogue is disjointed and sounds like a single adult arguing with the demon's inside his head. I began reading the lines in my head with a comically flat delivery. As if none of the people involved would even make eye contact with one another, which at least boosted the entertainment value of the book marginally.

Again, thank you for reading. Hopefully, I have saved you a bit of money. If not, I hope you enjoyed the venting just as I enjoyed reading some of the other reviews. Some of them are really quite clever and thought out. You should read those instead of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

A friend of mine posted a pic of her brand new Harry Potter and The cursed Child Book on Facebook.  Apparently her amazing hubby spent the entire day looking for.  I jokingly said to Nathan, ""Why can't you be like her hubby and get me my Harry Potter book too?""  He told me that he would get me the book that day.  I snorted at this response because you usually have to pre-order a Harry Potter Book.  ""There is no way you will be able to find the book babe.""  I said.  ""Do you wanna bet?"" He responded with far to much confidence for my liking.  ""Cool, what do you want?"" I replied... ""A hand job for a month.""  We shook on it and I smiled inside certain that I would win this one.  Not realizing that if he came home empty handed I would not really score.

Husband returned home with said elusive book and I was stunned.  I won't be going into our betting arrangement but Rowling owes me, not my hubby as the title suggests, a months worth of sexual favours.  I finished this book last night and afterwards wished I had never been born.  The only thing semi decent was its cover... They yellow made me feel happy and warm inside... The book was ridiculously awful, plot holes bigger than a whore's vagina, and characters that dulled the life right out of me... I will be wishing upon the next shooting star I see for a time tuner.

It was such a chore reading this script--I kept waiting for the characters to transform into their usual intelligent, caring, scrappy selves, but instead, they were all bland charicatures. Every line Ron had made me cringe.  He came off as some drunken, idiotic waste of space. To be honest, most lines in this book made me cringe. The plot was so thin, and every time there was a problem it was solved 2 pages later. There was no suspense whatsoever.

I found myself at the end of the book wondering what in the world I had just read because it was so boring I barely remember what had transpired. There was one single page that evoked emotion for me. ONE PAGE!

King","Shameful... such a letdown!","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2016","SPOILER FREE
There were so many bad decisions that went into making this it's hard to believe the person who wrote the finely crafted interlocking world of the original books was involved in any way.
First, why on earth would you issue the final episode in the form of a play? People keep saying ""well it's probably better on stage"". Well, the fan base is an ardent worldwide group of novel readers. Choosing to only show the true version of the story to ONE room of people in one place at a time was a just a poor choice. Everyone else gets cold and frankly ridiculous sounding stage directions instead of pages of rich description from one of the greatest writers of the century.

Second, and much more importantly, this story line is so bad it's actually gut-wrenching. As a huge long time potter it was so hard and painful to read. I don't usually like being critical or snobbish about movies or books. I try to enjoy them for what they are and not dissect them 100 different ways. That being said this script was so full of plot holes and inconsistencies it's actually hard to believe JK ever read it. Books can and will be written about the problems with this story line. It is completely incompatible with the world the original 1~7 books established. I would provide examples but don't have it in me to open the book again. The motives and actions of many of the characters make absolutely no sense at all. The decisions of both the protagonists and the main villain are so absurd and illogical that the only explanation is plot convenience to take the audience to revisit an old story.
It's so frustrating to see an almost perfect series, something which will live on as a classic; tarnished by what is essentially a polished turd.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Seriously. Usually there's plenty by which to make a decision to purchase or not.

This sample is less than a page long.

There's more space devoted to the copyright material.

Come on, Amazon, fix this. Unless this is all you're allowed to preview? In which case this is someone else's bad decision.

Until that happens: everyone go to Goodreads. There's a review there that has more play text than this.

Sadly, it's not impressive. The review is largely positive, but what lines you see are, well, stilted would be a kind way to put it. Lots of telling, not showing. Also, very cliché. And already some serious conflicts with the existing books, which I can't say enough good things about.

At any rate, I'm dubious. I may buy a used copy from someone just to see, but I won't be buying it here, thanks to the bad joke of a sample. And I rarely have any complaints about Amazon.

Hopefully I'll be pleasantly surprised by the actual script, but.... Well, at present, I can see why people have complained. I have no issue with it being in play format and was frankly intrigued to see how it read, how it translated into the different storytelling form. But a play should still be readable, and what I saw quoted in several Goodreads reviews was just trying.

Fanfic can be excellent and sometimes even better than what inspired it. But what I've seen so far is not promising.

That being said, there are a couple things I expect from a Rowling endorsed work that presumably will be  treated as canon. I expect the work to play by the rules set down in the original series and I expect character actions to make sense considering their personalities and motivations in the original series. Unfortunately, this was not the case for the cursed child.

This play had major conflicts with mechanics established in the original series. Aside from that, after extensive mapping and diagramming of the events, I determined that at least 3 major events could not have ocurred solely based on the information provided in this play. I am aware that the main series contains occasional inconsistencies, however, the plot holes in this play are used to drive the main story. At some point  you need a  story that is plausible within the  boundaries of the fantasy world. The  Cursed child's plot is fundamentally impossible even while ignoring conflicts with the original series.

In addition to story plausibility, many characters acted contradictory to their personality in the  original series. I understand that people change as time goes by, but there are several cases in which a character who has not changed completely undermines his original series self. The amazing character arcs that Rowling created are competely thrown out the window.

Overall, this felt like a story written by someone who did not bother to maintain consistency with the previous novels or even within this story itself.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_165?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=165&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

So, what. Much of the great literature is written in play-form. This is NOT great, however. Not even good! I was hesitant to buy this, based on the early Amazon reviews, but Michiko Kakutani, of The New York Times, gave it a great review. I can only say: Thanks, Michiko, for wasting my time and money! This is SO far from the quality of the Harry Potter series, it's really appalling that Rowling gave it her blessing. The plot is amateurish. There is a real lack of understanding of the way children think, act, or speak. Frankly, NONE of the characters were recognizable. And worse: it is POORLY WRITTEN, folks! Poor grammar! Yeah, apparently you can be a successful script writer without being able to write proper English! Wow! This is a shock and a disappointment.

The entire plot is just a big cliche of another typical butterfly effect scenario, and a very simplified one at that.

Your books have inspired me, a 13 year old girl to write books of my own. Gosh, I was so in love with your world and its magic, I begged for my mom and dad to let me cut a harry potter scar of my own. They refused, and said I would have to wait until I was 18. I still remember all those nights I cryed myself to sleep because my mom and dad wouldnt let me watch or read them. I remember despairing, and thinking they would never LET me read them all or watch them. I dreamed of harry potter, i had wonderful magical dreams. I used to say that I was Lily Potter, I was Harry Potters daughter. I was so desparate that when no one was there I looked up spoilers of the movies and books. Then pretend that I watched the movies with him... i remember being made fun of, my brother and sister made fun of me and made me so mad and sad. ""You dont even LOOK like him!""
""Your being delusional!"" ""Your a lyer.""
I told them, ""I put a spell on myself to make me look like a brown haired girl, but really i am Lily... with red hair and brown eyes."" I remember staying up super late to do pretend homework, pages and pages of it, till my hand almost fell off. Me and my freind used to pass letters back and forth, pretending to do lessons at hogwarts, detention, quidditch, yule ball. I used to cry when I read parts of Harry Potter when people made fun of him... i knew how he felt! I wrote down every single speel and memerized it. I was so excited when I heard that there was a 8th book coming out, I counted down the days, Months, years... and when I finally got the sample the day it came out... i wanted to cry. What have you done to my Freinds and companions! Where is that exciting magical action packed book that i love so much! Where is the jokes, where is GEORGE!!! What happend to smart clever HERMIONE!!! What happend to Brave and kind HARRY!!! GINNY! RON!!! LILY!!!!!! DUMBLEDORE!!! Jk Rowling, please dont tell me you actually approved of this and LIKED it???? Please! What has happend! I look up to you so much... you are what keeps me going when I despair of writing my book. But now... I want to cry.
Please, everyone says this is your last book! Dont let it be! Write another that is actually the ""8TH BOOK!!!"" Please. please. please. You broke so many hearts the day you let them publish that. I will never understand, and I know you might not take me seriously because Im only 13, but please consider.

It felt like the characters we know so intimately, and love so dearly, were ABSOLUTE strangers...This book is a disgrace to their legacy! Harry was totally unrecognizable, and one dimensional, for the majority, nay, the ENTIRETY, of the story. Hermoine lost all the cleverness and grace that makes her so lovable/heroic. And Ron was essentially comic relief, with no depth whatsoever. Couldn't feel further from the Trio that we've come to know, love, and call our best friends. Not only was their dialogue and interaction so bizarre, but the other characters as well; including the highly anticipated kids of our heroes. I legitimately tried to stretch my imagination to see the scenes in my mind and heart, and there were certainly a few (and I mean VERY few) tender moments with a small glimmer of familiarity to JK's wizarding world, but the horrific plot and dialogue quickly turned tenderness into disappointment. I'm seriously so saddened that JKR put her stamp of approval on this, normally she can do no wrong in my eyes, but this book was such a disappointment. There's more wizarding world familiarity in a 60 second trailer for Fantastic Beasts, than there was in this entire book!

I am still currently for probably the thousandth time rereading the books I grew up loving. Harry Potter and the cursed child is abismal. Harry, Ron, hermione, Draco, everyone is completely lost in this, they are just names used at this point. The story was sloppy and very rushed, moving years in only a few pages. I understand that as we grow older we change but this had very little left of anyone. At best I can describe it as a very poorly written fan fiction. Everything about what I at least loved about Harry Potter was completely removed. I understand this was a script for the play but I don't think it remotely was written by jk. If it was I would expect details from previous books to be correct and not severely muddled like the movies were. I am very dissapointed, and am not considering this a Harry Potter book, it was abismal. If there is anything I wish I could tell jk, it's this: we loved Harry yes but his story ended, we want more yes, but we fell in love with the world, and that is what we want more of. Tell us a story that has nothing to do with him or his family.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But before I get into it, I want to make a few things clear. 1. I knew it was a script and not a novel; that is not what I have an issue with. 2. I am a massive Harry Potter fan and I absolutely love the books and movies. 3. I'm sure this is a very entertaining play to watch, but it does not belong in the Harry Potter franchise/universe.
Okay. The biggest problem with Cursed Child is that it wasn't written by Rowling. She can pretend that she had something to do with it, but she didn't, or if she did, she must really no longer care at all what happens to her precious wizarding world. This story had so many major plot holes that would never fly in a HP novel. Part of what makes Harry Potter so special is the amount of details that JK put into it. Nothing in the HP books was an accident, and even today almost 10 years later fans continue to notice amazing details that no other author would take the time to put into a ""children's"" story. Cursed Child reads like fan fiction, and there is nothing wrong with fanfiction, but it pisses me off to no end that Rowling is calling this an official sequel to her otherwise perfect series. This writer was lazy and decided to recycle a cliche story-line while ruining our beloved characters in the process. What is the point?We did not need this story. It gives no new insight to the wizarding world (unlike any of the short stories that were actually written by Rowling, those are great) and it does not tell us anything that we didn't already know about Harry. Spoiler alert (but not really): Harry works at the Ministry of Magic! His relationship with his son isn't perfect! But after useless conflict that only rehashes the past, everyone lives happily ever after! The magic of Rowling's books is not present here, and there are at least 3 major plot holes that ruin the entire integrity of the story. I don't want to actually spoil anything, because I do believe that you should read it for yourself, but this book is a disgrace. What makes me the most angry is that this piece of sh*t was given to us, and then Rowling says ""that's it for Harry! Cursed Child is the end of his story!"" when it should have never been part of his story in the first place. I could go on and on, but basically, this book sucks and it is ridiculous that it is considered canon. Jk Rowling was my queen, I thought that she could do no wrong, but after reading Cursed Child I have been seriously rethinking things.....","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The characters don’t even talk or behave as they did in Rowling’s books. It’s an insult to the intelligence of fans who have spent years reading and rereading the HP series. A couple of dudes who knew nothing about HP wrote this and screwed it up royally. I get the vibe that these two guys didn’t even bother to read the HP series...for example, if they did, they’d understand how the Fidelius Charm would work at the Potter’s home and how because James and Lily were hiding Harry, they weren’t able to leave the house (Lily mentions this in a letter the find she once wrote to Sirius in DH). Yet, here...the two dudes have James and Lily out pushing Harry in a pram. Major contradiction to the original story.

I feel like J.K. Rowling decided to have a contest where she had fans write the last story, and then would pick the best one as the winner while editing and changing it for inconsistencies.

Oh boy, where do I begin... First of all, this is not a book. This should be obvious to most, but in their zeal, some people have overlooked the fact that this is a play. A play not even written by JK Rowling.
As far as plays go, it is uninteresting and bland. Not terrible, but it's middle-school-pageant level stuff.
As far as Harry Potter stories go, it is a soul crushing disappointment.
Harry Potter stories are, at their core, mystery books in a fantasy magical setting. This play has no mystery to it. Sure, it has a twist or two, but no major overarching mystery that the characters and audience need to solve. The narrative plays out like a bad piece of fan fiction. There are some interesting parts at the beginning that do a decent job of getting you hooked, but after that, it's just plain awful stuff. One of the central pieces of canon from The Prisoner of Azkaban is completely ignored: The time turner. In Rowling's book series, a time turner is a device that allows you to rewind time by a few hours and live things back forward to the present. However, it does not allow you to change time. Before rewinding time, you are able to observe in own timeline anything that you do after rewinding time. Once you rewind time, you are destined to live that out exactly as it already happened. However, in this book, time turners are used to go back decades, and somehow only allow you to stay in the past a few minutes. They do this over and over again, Butterfly Effect style.
This turns Harry Potter and the Cursed Child into a time travel book. And The Butterfly Effect did it much better.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling has become the George Lucas of literature...","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2016","“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is an abomination.  Most people I have spoken with said they despised the script form used to tell the story; but that is not the problem.  The true problem lies in the mediocre attention to detail, poor writing style, predictable storyline, and general disregard for previous novels.  The story reads like a fan-fiction written by a thirteen-year-old.  Cannon from previous novels and J.K. Rowling’s website are thrown out the window to advance the storyline.  The new characters are easily forgettable and even the original characters (i.e. Harry, Ron, and Hermione) are utterly boring.  The story generally follows of a theme of “I love you and, therefore, I must protect you even though protecting you is the cause of the problem.”  The concepts of time travel, anomalies, and the Butterfly Effect are abused to the point it is painful to turn the page.  Some try defending the book by pointing out there are two other people who helped write this book and to that I say “irrelevant!”  By including her name on the cover, J.K. Rowling accepts full responsibility for this highly-disappointing novel.  The inferior quality of this book leads me to believe that J.K. Rowling only returned to the Harry Potter universe when she realized she had only one series to her name worth reading.  After reading “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, it is clear she has no regard for her previous works, her fans, and the literary world.  J.K. Rowling has become the George Lucas of literature, choosing to throw her passion for storytelling away for the sake of a few quick bucks.  I have already dispensed of my copy of this book and will never read a future piece of writing by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, or Jack Thorne from this moment on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Overall, it read like mediocre fan fic.
The relationship development was clumsy. In trying to show a close relationship between friends, the author made it seem like Albus and Scorpious would end up together but then it came to nothing. The author clearly had no experience writing relationships or young characters. Also, Harry is a complete jerk throughout (probably because he can't come to terms with his son being gay). His charter as a whole is completely tarnished.
Finally, there are a lot of characters I'd rather see in this than voldermort's secret love child. None of the other Weasly kids appear, no Teddy, no Victorie. And Ron has reverted back to the maturity of a 14 year old. Poor Hermione!

It started off okay. There's the whole teenage angst and not wanting to be compared to someone from your family (your siblings, or should I say DAD in this case). But then it fell apart when Harry Potter, the boy we grew up with, apparently does not grow up in the bildungsroman that is supposed to be the Harry Potter series.

And apparently, being in an adult means you can't be a competent wizard. Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemart with an Expelliarmus spell - AN EXPELLIARMUS SPELL- who was just so incredibly talented in the dark arts and magic, could not even defeat the titular character 'the cursed child' by himself.

If the need was felt to contribute anything more to this series, by the author or otherwise, it should have been to properly end Harry's journey. What did Harry, Ron and Hermione do after Hogwarts? Other than to get married and have children. Did Harry become a professor? Where is Hagrid? There were so many loose ends that really should have been tied up. I wanted more from The Deathly Hallows than to know the victor of Harry's battle with Voldemort. (I am still very disappointed with the ending.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

An unbelievable disappointment. I wish there was a spell that could make me forget this drek.

The Dementors aka John Tiffany and Jack Thorne have sucked the soul out of Harry Potter. Clearly they've already gotten to JK to allow this.

Story was weak. Writing was worse. Plot...infantile. What a horrible attempt to cash in. Not even a tiny bit original. JK Rowling should be embarrassed. How she could allow this to be published...and with her name on it.

This 'play' could (might) have been written by a 5th grader, a slow 5th grader. I wonder if JK Was merely drunk while watching 'Back to the future' one day and thought 'gee, I could make another $250,000,000 or so with that.

The reviews do not do the story justice.

""Really? Another Harry Potter? Um, is Rowling desperate to recapture fame? Has she already spent up her vast fortune and in need of a cash injection? .... Oh, I gotta take a peek anyway""
This was the flow of internal dialogue I had in my head as I approached the shelf and nervously picked up a copy. My cynical mind wrestled with my hopeful heart. Maybe, just maybe, this will be a fun read.

I leafed through the first section and grew increasingly dismayed and profoundly irritated with myself for having wasted 20 minutes reading it in the store. When I left and arrived home, I had three benefits from reading that first part:

1) I'm glad I didn't purchase it. What a waste of money that would have been.
2) While it sucks to be right, at least I didn't waste more of my life reading it in the feint hope it might improve
3) By the time I got home and set about venting my frustration to my husband, I realized my brain had already purged 2/3 of what I read.

At school in England I had to read stories in “Play” format so I do not have a problem with that type of reading. My problem with this book is that the characters are NOT AT ALL who they are, or should I say were!
At the end of the last book we see that Harry SEEMS to have a good relationship with Albus, as far as one can tell from a book ending. Now they dislike each other.
Draco saved Harry and Harry saved Draco. Though there was no conversation at the end of the last book one would think they had a mutual peace. Not so in the new book.
The story is not as well developed as the 8 book series.
Harry and Ron are Not Aurors???
Hermione is Minister???
A Time Turner would be kept in the Ministers office and those children would be able to figure out how to get it and work out how to use it???
3 turns goes back a few hours for the type Hermione had. I’m sure there is more than one type, but please.
I will finish the book but I don’t recommend it to anyone for the cost. It’s rather a big disappointment to end the story this way when Rowling could have done the encyclopedia of characters and made a lot of people really happy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_115?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=115&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I cannot tell you how big a part of my life the Harry Potter series has been. To say I adore it isn't enough. So The Cursed Child is killing me. It's so bad.

I tried so hard to tell myself that it's a play, it has to be a little different, they can't have every little detail and every single character. And I could get over missing details and characters. What I can't get over is the out right absurdity and silliness. I know it sounds like a crazy thing to say about a series about magic, but it's true. In the original series Rowling could write about unicorns and flying broom sticks and magical ways of being immortal, and she did it in a way that made you feel it was possible, made you feel like you could really be a part of that world. This book doesn't have that. Instead it has me shaking my head and getting irritated at how little it follows the concrete facts Rowling worked so hard to establish. It always amazed me how she wrote a series over several years and everything tied in so well together; this book just doesn't have that.

The first part I found ridiculous was the trolley witch. Suddenly she's this hundreds of years old being whose food turns into bombs and can turn her hands into spikes but apparently has no means of stopping two boys who are supposed to be bad at magic (they can't do spells well until they practice them, like twice, and suddenly they can. They also never get in trouble for doing magic outside of school) from jumping off the train.
Then there's the 'engorgio' charm. It sounds like a small detail but it really bugs me. They use it to engorge someone's head and he floats away. In the original series engorgio was used to make things bigger, not fill them with helium. As I said, it was something so normal in the original series, and it just gets completely skewed in this, and it's an example of this kind of thing happening multiple times.
Another thing I can't stand is the time turner. A man wants Harry to go back before Voldemort's return to power and save his son's life. This so greatly diminishes everything that was established in earlier books about time turners and even about Harry's relationship with this man.

There are so many other examples of things that just don't fit into the Harry Potter world, but the worst thing about reading this is that these characters just aren't the same. These aren't the characters we fell in love with. Ron's just a moron, I can't get a grasp on who Harry is at all, and with Draco it's like they can't make up their minds about if he's supposed to be nice or a jerk. You would expect Rose, with a laid back father, loving mother, and close nit family to be a good person, but she's nothing but a little snob. Honestly with the huge Weasley family and all the others Harry's surrounded himself with, you just expect them all to be close nit and loving, but that's just no the case and it's so sad.

The deeper into this book I get, the more it feels like a fanfiction written by a juvenile, and the more I feel like it has to be a joke. It's sad for those of us who have stuck loyally by this series to see Rowling willingly put her name on something that so clearly undermines the series she worked hard to create. This is not the Harry Potter we know and love.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_102?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=102&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I felt she sold out on the Dumbledore's gay thing, after she said she would explain the veil and voices thing And Didn't, after she she had more to write in THBP and TDH but didn't coz she said ""her fans didn't want to read a long book again"", that she was going deeper in the Harry,Lily,Green eyes,Voldemort thing and didnt, and even when she was shaming us because we were upset that the play Hermione was black. Fine fine fine. But to me this script play book -whatever- is unforgivable. She tells us Voldemort is incapable of love, she tells us he didn't need anyone, she tells us he didn't care for being touched so we're to believe that he and Bellatrix -in the middle of a war against Harry- are just going to stop everything to have sex? He might have trusted her as much as he could but to physically connect with her,come on.  And for them to have a child to go back and try to change time so her father could win-whatever.  This was a cheap attempt to smear us-her beloved readers- with bringing back cherished characters from the dead for a last hurrah.  This fan fiction should have never been allowed to besmirch any of us or our characters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

You start the story exactly where you'd expect things, except for Harry's son Albus being a moody sourpuss (young Snape type) character.  The first Act was okay, then when the major plot twist happens at the beginning of Act 2, everything you knew and loved about the original books hits the proverbial fan.  I had to put the book down because it was so difficult to endure.
This book by no means is a long read.  One with middle school reading abilities could read it through in a matter of a long evening (it is a play after all).  However, the metaphorical stabs to the heart made me take days in between sessions.  Like a masochist, I went back for more.  Only to experience the assault to memory of a beloved character/story over and over.
This is not a lot different then if you had a magic wand (pun intended) to wave and fix the last season of Game of Thrones...except in complete reverse.  You had a perfect story, neatly tied up in a pretty bow, and you burned it like an anarchist just to watch it burn.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Long story short, if you are a fan of the books, do yourself a favor and skip this script because it reads like a poorly written fanfic. Here are the following reasons why:

1. A lot of the characters act and say things completely out of character - like the script was written by someone who only watched the movies and did not read the books. You will experience your favorite characters saying and doing things that they would never say or do in the original books. This script was clearly not written by Rowling and written by writers who have no in-depth understanding of the nuances of each character.
2. The major plot line is something that isn't even possible in the original Harry Potter books. Prepare to have a major theme from one of the books reversed in the script. The plot line is also a cliche and overused trope in television shows.
3. This script has no major consequence on the original plot. So you aren't missing out on anything by not reading this.

Conclusion to the spoiler-free section: There's a reason why most HP fans are calling this a poorly written fanfic. That's because in bad fan fiction, the writers don't usually get the characters correctly and use overused and un-creative plot devices you see in movies and TV shows. This is exactly how I would describe this script.

***SPOILERS SECTION***
To go more in-depth in my points above (with spoilers), let's look at #1-3 again.

1. The original characters are back including Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their spouses. But Harry has temper tantrums that he never exhibited in the books. Hermione is done correctly while Ron is reduced to slapstick humor. Draco seems a bit out of character as well. Snape makes a brief cameo and does the weirdest things you wouldn't expect Snape to do. Like he actually calls Ron by his first name and gets a bit sappy. You would expect Snape to keep calling Ron ""Weasley.""
2. The major plot line is about going back in time and establishing alternate universes. First of all, THAT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE IN THE BOOKS. In the third book, we learned that whatever happens, already happened and cannot be changed. Time cannot be changed in the Harry Potter universe. You can go back in time but that has already happened and the consequences have already happened. In the third book, Buckbeak was already saved before Harry and Hermione went back in time. Second, going back in time and changing the timeline is an overused trope in television and movies. It is un-creative and lazy because everything just goes back to the way it was at the end. And nothing new was added. This leads to #3.
3. Like the overused trope in television shows, the alternate ""bad"" timeline is always fixed in the end and everything goes back to the way it was. This is exactly what happens in The Cursed Child. So you aren't really missing out by skipping this ""eighth"" installment. Nothing new is added. The conflict occurs in the past but everything is fixed in the end so it doesn't affect the present. In fact, by skipping this script, you will spare yourself the facepalms and anger that might come up from the terribly written plot and character development.

Conclusion for the spoilers section: Harry's kid goes back in time and messes things up. Oh no, Voldemort is now in power. Now they have to go back and correct it. They do. Everything goes back to normal. Yay. That's it. Plus you can't even recognize the characters sometimes because they do and say things they would have never done in the original books. This script does nothing to add to the Harry Potter universe and is worth skipping to spare yourself of the poor writing and constant contradictions to the original HP universe.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Bird","Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs: Not true Potterverse and NOT AT ALL true JKR writing","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2016","Reads badly like a story in a monthly magazine written for subscribers. I feel they disrespected the Potter fans worldwide and am returning this book pronto.
Found glaring plotholes(IMO) and like another reviewer said, the characters do not stay true to their own values from the original series.
Really bad fanfic! Not at all worth the hype and the fact that there is a ""Definitive script"" also being released later at some point shows that the publishers and whoever else is making even a single penny off this book have published it for the money.
Should not say this is the ""Eighth story, 19 years later"" and tarnish the memories and expectations of the readers. Especially when JKR keeps blowing her trumpet saying that her Potter writing is done fully and finally, but still keeps churning content regularly!
Personally, I would like to say to JKR that she should have waited to publish this work and ironed out all the discrepancies and issues first instead of what seems to be a very rushed and improperly vetted publication.
Not even worth 10$ and they are selling it for 18$ on Amazon to make that fast buck before everyone catches onto the absolute rubbish that this book is.
I don't mind it being a play OR a script but even as either it seems terrible with magical beings making muggle references in dialogue amongst other terrible nuisances this book creates.
JKR, it's OK to not put out more HP stuff, we can live with what's already out there but please don't ruin it for everyone by giving your blessing to such ditchwater writing. Sorry John Tiffany and Jack Throne, maybe your own creative characters would have had more justice done than for you both to have used the names of the favourites of millions worldwide and disappointing them such.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Pity the living, and, above all pity those who read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","Spoilers!!

Huge Harry Potter fan-- 16 years of reading!! So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned.  What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it.  The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm  didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first.  Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.

If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it.  And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books.  This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.

Also, what they did to calm, measured, quirky, wise Dumbledore, making him a weepy, rude mess, who spoke in cliches, issuing a completely unnecessary ""apology"" to why Harry was at the Dursleys, when Dumbledore had already apologized profusely for that in HP5 AND severely told off the Dursleys in HP6 for their abusive behavior! It was just phony emotional porn!

  And Ron's a proper idiot who got drunk during his wedding?! He would have never disrespected Hermione like that. Hermione was neither clever, nor charming; she didn't come up with hardly any solutions. And what a weak, floppy mess Harry was during the fight scene?! His 16 year old self could have fought better. It's like they sucked the soul out of the books, like a dementor wrote it!! This is not even pointing out the horrible plot holes! No, I refuse this book is real. It's a bloody mess!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's the story, the story is absolutely vapid, and were it not for its title it would have been discarded among the throng of shameful attempts at engaging storytelling. The plot is centered around time travel, quite possibly the most cringeworthy storyline cliché imaginable and completely passes over the essence of the series in the first place. Throughout the first few acts the reader is constantly being jerked around in a half-assed attempt to catch them up to speed, and the sparse snapshots of life that we are shown do little to rival the sentiment of merely watching an episode of Full House. I'm thoroughly convinced that anybody who rushes to the defense of this book is so intransigently entrenched in fandom that they couldn't work past the guilt of having grown up with Harry Potter to even consider slandering this abomination to an incredible series. I can't help but think that this shoehorned hardback is opportunism at its finest.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I loved the original Harry Potter books, and I even thought The Casual Vacancy and the Galbraith books were pretty good.

Unfortunately, this reads like bad fanfiction. My favorite characters appeared in name only, with none of the depth, charm or interesting dynamics that made the original Potter books so compelling.

Perhaps the lack of character development could have been saved by an interesting plot, but the Cursed Child lacks that as well. The storyline is driven by how growing up in the shadow of his father, Harry Potter, makes Albus Potter a dark and tortured soul. Although Albus' siblings seem perfectly well adjusted (basically mini-Fred and mini-Ginny), Albus suffers from ANGST, causing him to pull incredibly stupid stunts that advance the plot in the absence of any logic or reason.

Clever, creative world building could have possibly saved this illogical story with flat, annoying characters. And yet the writers fail to add any dimensions to the HP Universe, instead using old set pieces (that I used to know and love) in ways that make no sense while simultaneously sucking all the whimsy and wonder out of Magical Britain.

Disappointing. Embarrassing for J.K. Rowling!","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2016","I'll start by saying that I'm in the camp of people who knew this was a script of the play, not an actual book. That having been said, this ""play"" is absolutely horrible. My main thought while reading this was ""Did Rowling even READ this drivel before she signed off on it?"" There are several inconsistencies with the original story and characters, and don't even get me started on the odd phrases that the original characters would have never used, such as Ludo Bagman. ""Krazy Krum??"" ""Delicious Diggory??"" The Ludo Bagman we know was jovial and slightly immoral, but never that ridiculous. Ludo isn't the only problem; none of the characters were true to themselves, and they were even unrecognizable in some ways.There are parts that are mildly entertaining, but nearly enough to redeem itself. On the whole, I simply cannot believe that J.K. Rowling allowed her name to be associated with what basically amounts to glorified fanfiction - and not even particularly good fanfiction, either.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If Harry Potter and the Cursed Child had been marketed as a work of fan fiction inspired by the series, I would probably be generous enough to give it a second star. I, like most reviewers here, love all things Harry, after all. Or thought I did. No, what is truly unforgivable about Cursed Child is the fact that it is marketed as official canon.

SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERS

Now on to what passes for a plot. The main plot device revolves around time-turners- something that is difficult to pull off well in the first place. JK's original conception of a closed time loop, which helped to make Prisinor of Askaban such a great, tight story, is completely absent here. Instead, Albus and Scorpius go back in time and change the present as a result. Not only does this leave gaping plot holes as far as the eye can see, but it seems like nothing but a poor ploy to bring back dead characters in alternate universes. There are so many original stories that could have been constructed around the Harry Potter universe. But instead we have to suffer through hackneyed cliches that would make a 14 year old cringe. Obviously, this would all be more impressive on the stage, rather than in script format, but the fact that the writers were willing to sacrifice characters and plot for cheap thrills, shows that little respect remains for the fans and what originally made Rowling's books so magical.

This leads me into what was, for me, the worst aspect of the story of all. The characters are completelely one-dimensional and lifeless. They seem like parodies of their former selves. Real emotion is sacrificed on the altar of cheap expressions and woeful writing. It reads like a bad soap opera. Like a terrible cover of your favourite song. Albus and Scorpius are the least egregious, through virtue of their being new characters not explored at length in the canon. Harry, Ron and Hermione are shallow. Dumbledore, instead of wise and magical, is a weeping mess. Haven't the writers heard that 'less is more?'.

Finally, this brings me to the climax of this hot mess. Voledmort's child. No. Just no. This is a plot device so cliched it should make anyone cringe. Also, the logistics make zero sense. Negative sense. Are we really supposed to believe that Voldemort and Bellatrix had time to make a child during the Battle or Hogwarts? Of all the devices they could have come up with, it would be almost impossible to conceive of something as half-baked as this. It's like a bad sequel, but worse.

I don't know what I should have expected. I knew this was a play, I knew it could almost certainly never be as good as the original series, but nothing could have prepared me for this monstrosity. Again, if it was not passed off as canon, I would probably have had a chuckle at it before trying to expunge it from my memory. But as it is, it's unforgivable. Fortunately someone bought it as a present for me, so at least I saved my thirty dollars. But I also can't know the satisfaction of tearing it to pieces. Honestly, there's MUCH better fan fiction to be found out there, by people who are loyal to the spirit of the canon. But Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is flash with no meaning. A cash grab with less soul than a Horcrux.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I thought this seemed an awful lot like one of those time travel/alternate universe episodes of once upon a time. Like they decided to do a Harry Potter and once upon a time crossover fanfiction.

To begin with, Harry and Draco are friends just like Snow White and Regina (evil queen)  become friends on ouat. Except that relationship had at least two seasons to develop before Regina finally decided to ditch her grudge with Snow White, charming, and Emma. This just comes out of nowhere. It could work if we had a story about draco's official redemption (I think there were several moments in the original series where we saw potential for Draco to break away from the death eater crowd).

THEN THE VILLAINESS' PARENTAGE IS REVELAED AND MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED THAT THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN ZELENA TOO!!!

The plot is pretty much the same as season 3b of once upon a time. The villainess' goal is to get back in time to prevent her father (Voldemort, who she has never met) from being killed by Harry Potter. When we first see her, she is disguising herself as Cedric Digory 's cousin and appears innocent just as Zelena the wicked witch of the west disguised herself as a midwife to get close to the heroes. On that show zelena wants  to go back in time to prevent her mother from giving her up. And reek havoc on the hero's lives!!!!

And Cora was The Dark One's best student and the creators have left open ended as to weather or not rumple is regina's real father. Apparently the Dark Lord had a child with his most loyal follower.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This play is one of the worst pieces of literature that I have ever read. I am, like a lot of the world, a huge Harry Potter fan and this book is more along the lines of fan fiction. Badly written, unimaginative, poorly constructed fan fiction, to be exact. It is too bad that the story couldn't have just ended in a dignified manner, instead of the characters' children being dragged through the mud and the same magical and juvenile mistakes explored again and again. The book beats one over the head with the dangers of time travel, which again is not a new concept in fiction. Anyone with any literary knowledge knows that if you step on a butterfly things will be different when you return. I recommend the book to absolutely no one. What a gigantic waste of time. If I could I would return the book as it is broken. It demeans and limits the characters from Harry Potter, they are washed out to be caricatures of their former selves. I was giving it my all and trying to remain objective until I got to the poly juice potion, a repetitive element from the original stories that it is no longer original.  I am surprised that Rowling lent her name and endorsement to this endeavor. Unless the stage show is along the lines of the Lion King in spectacle it must be a grueling two day experience. We are used to something new and fantastic from the mind of JK Rowling and the newest eighth book (what a bad choice of description) verifies that the imagination and storytelling of Rowling is not anywhere near what is offered between the pages of this play. Such a sad last attempt at glory for the Harry Potter series.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Going in I assumed this was written by J.K Rowling, but from reading could glean fairly early Rowling didn't write it. The characters seemed off in general and their interactions with one another didn't fit their characters. Ultimately not knowing someone else wrote it was my own fault, but to be fair her name is rather distinct under the title and it was advertised as the eight story. (It even says so on the back cover.) Anyway, that all aside I still planned on enjoying the script for what it was, a story written by not J.K. Rowling and not a perfect representation of all of the beloved characters from the original books, but still a good story. Nope. The plot is garbage. If you take just a minute to think about it, it makes no sense in the context of the universe that was created. The new characters don't have many, if any redeeming qualities to them and the fact that the villain even exists makes me want to strangle someone! The entire story angers me deeply and thoroughly. Unfortunately, in the end it's a half baked idea that reads more like bad fan fiction. If you are a fan of the original stories avoid this like the plague. How on earth could Rowling have O.K.'ed this story?

It breaks my heart as a HUGE Harry Potter fan that I have to give this a bad review but I simply can't give it a good one.
I don't know why jk Rowling would but her name on this was it for the money!??? Because this is NOT her work
The characters are not even close to who they are and the new charters are underdeveloped. * small spoiler* but what's up with Dumbledores!!??? He was uncharacteristically emotional and the same thing with harry after all harry has been through and lost he whined and cried more in this one story then in all seven books and Snape!???? I liked the idea of seeing Snape again but sadly it wasn't anything like Snape he was just to nice and to open feeling *spoiler end*
I'm the kind of person that can't predict what will happen next even when mostly everyone else can but in this story I could what going to happen every few pages the plot just sucked after JK Rowling spent so much time and effort in the other 7 books and connected every detail so well it's a insult to call this the 8th book the only thing I liked was the idea of some parts of the and that's it.

Super excited to finally have some more Harry Potter, since i grew up with the series, and absolutely loved it. That said, the Cursed Child was a complete and abject disappointment. It reads like a bad fanfiction, and the characters have been completely butchered.

Harry is an obnoxious helicopter parent, resembling Lucius Malfoy way to much for my comfort, and repeatedly putting down McGonagall and Dumbledore because they never had kids.

Wtf? These people practically raised you, you twit! And McGonagall just sits there and passively takes his s***?! Nah-ah, the Minerva we all know would have put him in his place.

And of course, the main blunder *SPOILER* Voldy and Bellatrix's baby.. WTF? Where was this baby while DH was going on? Was she about to pop while torturing Hermione? No one noticed? Or was she torturing Hermione while caressing a big ol' belly?

And if she was sooo obsessed with Voldy, why wouldn't she stay back and guard his kid? Why wouldn't V want to protect his legacy (and potential horcrux)?

Finally, Delphy's convoluted plot to off Harry makes no sense. Cedric is insignificant in the scheme of things. Go back and kill Lily as a kid. Go back and kill James at school. Go back and convince V not to try to kill Harry, but rather adopt it him. Soooo many alternatives.

The only redeeming element was Scorpius, since he was pretty funny. Other than that, the book is garbage. No matter what JK says, this junk will not be part of the HP canon in my head.

Final score: Yuck.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I walked into this realizing that the book was not written by JK Rowling and as such would be different in tone, but this was honestly not good. I, like everyone else here, have read all the Harry Potter books and am an avid fan, so when I saw an 8th book was coming out to expand on the short epilogue, I was obviously excited. One page in I already knew that this was not going to be what I expected. The dialogue between the characters was awkward and stunted, the jokes were painful, and the way the writer worded some actions just didn't make sense. For example, can we talk about this line? ""The Sorting Hat walks through the students, who spring into their houses"". Since when does the Sorting Hat walk around? I haven't even mentioned how odd Ron is in this book. He cracks Dad jokes and pranks people, which would be fine if he was George or even Mr. Weasley, but Ron had never struck me as the dad jokes and running a joke shop guy. Everything just feels wrong. There was even a line in there about Professor McGonagall walking around with a large smile on her face. Since when is Professor McGonagall a cheery, wide-smile kind of lady? There just seem to be inconsistencies all over the place.

The following comments are my own opinion.
Edgar Rice Burroughs beginning writing Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, At the Earth's Core, etc. when, as a struggling salesman, he read the serial novels in magazines, and said, ""I can write something this bad!""  This is how I feel about the HP and the Cursed Child script - even I could have written something this terrible!  The characters were one dimensional distortions of the ones we know form the HP novels, the dialogue was shallow and insufferable, and the plot entirely predictable given the THOUSANDS of previous works dealing with the consequences of time travel.  There is absolutely nothing original here, and it has all been done, and better done, by many, many others.  It was terribly boring, and I found myself wondering if the writer(s) were paid by the word, because it was the ""script that would not die!""  I thought it would never end!  I couldn't stand it, and I don't know how JKR would have allowed her name to appear on it.  The entire story deserved 30 pages or less for the entire plot (a very weak one) to have been written, and, frankly, I think should have never been written.

The ""magic"" was all a re-do of prior stuff all mashed up and contrived.  The characters were NOT the ones from the novels.  The story line was a boring re-do of countless time travel stories.  The plot moved forward at the speed of a receding glacier.  I only wish I could sell my Kindle version at a used book store, but, alas, I can't, and can only delete from my devices.

While I have some hope for the upcoming movie, I""m canceling my pre-order of the script.  I've learned my lesson!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The characters have become completely foreign to me - I do not recognize them.  I despised Harry's son Albus, he seemed to be a largely annoying, whiny brat, who has far less sense than Harry did on his worst day.  Ron has become nothing more than a bumbling comic relief stooge.  On the whole, the book felt incredibly cheesy, made me cringe, and I had to struggle to finish it.

In my mind, despite what J.K. Rowling says, the Harry Potter series ended with the seventh book.

I love J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series. What she did was nothing short of masterful. Those books were fleshed out to the point of being real, feeling real. Every damn sentence had a purpose, a meaning, lead to a bigger picture. This...felt nothing short of a cheap knock off. Honestly, if Cursed Child had been released as a fanfic or an side story, it would have been okay but...I just cannot believe she would release this haphazard mess as cannon.
I grew up with these characters, I know them well. Cursed Child did not include any of the characters I remember from the original series, at best I would call them mere shadows of their formal selves. Where is Ginny's spark? What happened to Harry's bravery and true heart? Why is Hermione so bumbling now? Where is Ron's everything? (Seriously though, what the hell happened to Ron?) And don't even get me started on Dumbledore.
I knew things would feel different in this book being based on a screen play but I at least expected the dialog to be on point, but no. There were many times the characters would 'say' things that made everything J.K. did in the way of world and character building crumble.  Plus that prophecy? Did a 5 year old write it? All of these problems just chip away at the plots' integrity until we are left with a shoddy fanfic written by someone who was under qualified and over imaginative.
The one shining star in the whole novel was Scorpius Malfoy-obviously they put the most of their effort into him and his character but that is unacceptable when you are writing in the world of Harry Potter.
To people on the fence about whether or not you should read it allow me to give you this one piece of advice, If I could, I would go back and not read it. The sour taste it left is very hard to swallow.  However, I had to read it-bad reviews and all.
Let me be clear-I did not like this; could not like this book because of how much I loved the original series. Having read this feels like I cheated on a perfect relationship and spoilt all the good it brought me.So, my plan is to forget about this book as soon as possible before it becomes a permanent dark stain on a otherwise perfect world.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

BE WARNED!

When first introduced to the Harry Potter series, I really thought nothing of it-literaly- , that the amount of fame it had gotten at the time was, well, crazy.
 But after reading  even the first few pages I instantly got hooked and have adored the series ever since then.
Now when I heard a few months prior to the opening date that there was a new Harry Potter book, I was just thrilled!
But after reading page after page my excitement started to turn dull, and I couldn't feel the vibe I usually felt when opening up one of J.K Rowling's HP books.
Of course, I kept in mind that it wasn't the original author who wrote this book, and that was probably the biggest problem about this book.
Even if you bring in the seemingly best writer in the world to continue a book, there will most certainly be a change in the atmosphere of the book.
Harry Potter, the one thing in the world he wanted was a family, and he can't give up ministry work time to spend time with the only one he has now?
Hermione and Ron's daughter, Rose, judging a 'book by its cover' before even knowing the person.
That's not what either the parents would ever teach their children.
Look, the format of this book was 'alright'- a bit kidish to me- but I am only saying it was alright solely because of Snape.
But the characters weren't really truly there.
I felt as though throughout the whole book everything was monotone, just a robot talking, and that- as weird as it is to say- did break my heart a bit that these wonderful characters were wasted.
There was no joyful, scary, sinister, homey, evil, and AMAZING feeling in this book at all. But I need, really really need J.K Rowling to rewrite this herself.
No shade on the two new authors, but you can't just write someone else's book without making it your own, and not everyone wants that..
Hope this was alright.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Third major problem: Stupid story line. I figured out ages ago that J. K.

So that makes me all the more disappointed in this play. While I understand that, as a play, it's meant to be performed, and some of the nuance might be lost in translation, the flaws are too dramatic to be excused like that. All our beloved characters, Harry, Hermione, Ron...they're all horribly out of character. And OTHER beloved characters (Neville, Luna, George, Teddy, to name a few) are completely missing. The plot is convoluted and overwrought, the big ""reveal"" is extremely obvious from very early on, and to be honest, the story is just...bad.

I wanted this play to be the heart-wrenching tale of a son trying desperately to connect to a father that he can't understand, the story of a father who is trying to come to terms with both his horrible past and the fact that his son seems to be the very antithesis of him. I wanted this story to be HUMAN, even though it's set in a magical world.

What I got was a story that is too caught up in its own magical setting to remember that a good story should ALWAYS be driven by the characters within it.

If you're a Harry Potter fan, feel free to get this book to complete your Harry Potter shelf of books. But don't go into it expecting to learn anything new about the Wizarding World that you fell in love with all those years ago. This play reads like poorly written fanfiction.

If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, in love with its rich characters and skillfully woven plot, this book will be nothing but a disappointment to you, as it certainly was for me. The magic is absent and the wit is nonexistent, and I often found myself staring in disbelief at the, frankly, absurd and bizarre, things that were happening. For specifics, read below, but fair warning, there are many spoilers.

From the first few pages even, you begin to get an inkling of its strangeness, of its total detachment from the world we all know and love, the world that was painstakingly crafted, with love and care, throughout the seven Harry Potter books. The Cursed Child holds none of that care -- in fact, it’s carelessly written, nonsensical, bizarre. The plot is an unbelievable mess, filled with gaping holes. The old characters are shadows of their former selves, so badly written that you begin to wonder if Jack Thorne gave the series anything more than a cursory glance before penning the monstrosity that is Ron’s characterization. Seriously. What the hell was that. The new characters are nowhere near interesting enough for us to even feign interest in them as people -- they’re one dimensional, walking cliches. Speaking of cliches, The Cursed Child overflows with them, exploring such contrived ideas such as “What if Cedric Diggory never died?” or “What if time-turners basically functioned like time machines?” or “What if Voldemort had a daughter with Bellatrix Lestrange?” Yes, you read that correctly. Said daughter is Delphi, our new antagonist, a quirky twenty-something that Albus Potter has the hots for, despite the fact that he’s...fourteen? The characters often know too much about the events that occurred within the series, to the extent that Albus or Amos Diggory can confidently recite the exact dialogue of an event that happened over twenty years ago. Essentially, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reads like bad fanfiction. Really bad fanfiction. If I hadn’t read it in a hardcover book that’s already sold millions of copies (regrettably), I would’ve assumed that The Cursed Child had been penned by a preteen Harry Potter fan, upset by “smexy” Cedric’s death and an unabashed shipper of Voldemort x Bellatrix. The fact that the screenplay was really written by a grown man, and given the a-ok by Rowling herself, is incredibly bewildering. Additionally, the whole business with the trolley witch? Three words. What. The. Hell.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Mistake number one.

I purchased this book/script after being on the fence about it for months.  Mistake number two.

I read the many disappointed reviews and still spent money on it.  Mistake number three.

That said.  I'm sure the play itself really helps in covering up the rickety story line and many gaping plot holes.  I'd imagine the play is perfectly enjoyable to watch.  This, however was so disappointing to read.  And that's coming from a huge Harry Potter AND time travel fantasy fan.  Our beloved characters acted so far out of character throughout.  The story jumps several years in a single bound.  Everything is incredibly forced (relationships, personality traits, conversations) and doesn't sound like Rowling at all!

If you must buy this, I recommend reading only after its been a good year since you read the original 7 books.  That way you have a decent opportunity to forget as much as possible about the original story and don't compare the new story too closely with the originals.  I hated the last chapter of the 7th book for how forced and out of character it was, and this book was exactly the same.

Simply seeing a piece of artwork involving Harry Potter can send me into tears. Met my husband in a Harry Potter chatroom. Have read all the books MULTIPLE times each, etc etc. I am a HUGE fan.

J.K. Rowling has disappointed me a couple of times since the last book came out (mostly when she said Hermione and Ron should not have ended up together), but I will say this is the single biggest disappointment. I know she didn't write it - but the fact that she endorses it, and that I am to take it as canon, is frankly sickening.

Time for me to get spoiler-y:

***********SPOILERS***********

The characters were SO OUT OF CHARACTER. I could believe Harry having struggles with fatherhood due to the fact that his was dead. However, telling Albus he wished he wasn't his son? No. Never. Those words would not come out of Harry's mouth, not matter how provoked. Rose being prejudiced towards Scorpius? ROSE WEASLEY, the spawn of Ron and Hermione? They would have taught her to NEVER judge based on house, I feel that she would never behave like that, shunning her own cousin just because he wanted to be friends with Scorpius. You're trying to tell me Draco Malfoy would be okay with his son befriending a Potter, and would have taught his son as much, but Hermione/Ron did not pass this along to Rose? Hermione was not her normal witty self, Ron did at least have some humorous moments - but Harry was just so off. Shunning family for work, telling Albus he couldn't be friends with Scorpius, his BEST FRIEND. That is something Harry would NEVER do. He knows the importance of friendship more than anyone! That is practically the whole point of the books. I just don't believe it.

Don't get me started on Voldemort having a daughter... He was never the type to be interested in procreating. I guess I could look over this, maybe he wanted to pass on his name, WHATEVER, but the fact that she is just kept hidden for years, and reemerges as Amos Diggory's nurse... why wasn't Harry's scar hurting the whole time? Why did he just now start to feel her presence? Why on earth would she choose to save Cedric in order to save Voldemort?! There are so many other ways she could have done that, much CLEANER ways, that perhaps wouldn't spawn a million different alternate timelines. And the time turner.. not even freaking canon, although I guess now I am supposed to consider it canon - going back in time as much as you want apparently, not to mention all of the things that doing that would change, and the fact that some people even had problems with how the third book handled messing with time. WHY CHOOSE THAT AS A PLOT? It's so hard to believe even when done properly. There are INFINITE other possibilities (as many other, BETTER fan fictions have explored). They could have done such great things with the story of Harry's kids. Instead they did this.

And Cedric becoming a death eater? Because he got humiliated at the triwizard tournament? HAS THE AUTHOR EVEN READ HARRY POTTER? Cedric was a purely GOOD human being, he would NEVER go to the dark side, especially over something so trivial. I don't even know if Cedric had the ability to feel humiliation, he was so confident in himself and his abilities. The fact that the entire plot of the book rests on him becoming a death eater like that is so ridiculous, it makes me sick to my stomach. He would've made a joke out of it and moved on, he didn't care if he won the tournament. I cannot believe this book was allowed to exist.

There were a very few select moments that I did enjoy. The flash of Hagrid as he picked Harry up out from Godric's Hollow (but, then again, anything involving Hagrid makes me melt). The fact that Albus was sorted into Slytherin was great, and the fact that Scorpius had a crush on Rose was great as well. Hermione being Minister of magic has long been my head canon. I admit I did shed some tears when Harry watched his parent's die, but only because that's a sad moment from the actual books. I don't like that he was there to witness it, along with all his friends and Draco. He saw it in his dreams, that should've been enough. There were some funny moments, mostly from Ron or Scorpius, but other than that, I really find nothing redeemable.

So, so disappointed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First of all, it IS not written like a book because IT WASNT MEANT TO BE. It's a screenplay. That is okay. What is NOT okay is how poorly this is made. She didn't even read the script. I have to believe she didn't care because none of the characters are in character. They are horrible people- kids included. Just...all terrible and disfunctional.

The magic is missing. The dialogue is very weak, the kind that a twelve-year old would use in their own version of a sequel to Harry Potter after eating too much sugar.  Stuff happens horribly and inexplicably, just plot devices to make this pulsating mass of garbage seem to work. It is bad. Just...I've read fanfiction like this and said 'NOPE!' on the first page and never read it again and yet people eat it up because they think JK did it. It is as if one of those crappy fics got published. And J.K. dares call these two horrible writers her 'dream team'. I am never buying anything from her again if other people are involved. It's nightmare fuel.

It is...all so, SO bad.

Not even a trace of her work in there and the discrepancies between everything- characters, world she built, spells and the way she made the world to be after war - are painfully obvious. It's like a bad fanfiction. Blind fanaticism is just making everyone rave but it is honestly a very poor work of fiction for anyone. The fact that this is cannon makes matters worse.

Fans, please! I beg you! Don't praise this piece of crap. It's money milking at its finest and it will only lead to very poor quality in the future until the series dies a horrible death. Tell it as it is. It's bad and she shouldnt have praised it or even approved it. Reading it and writing it should've been her job, not some random stranger who apparently never read the books.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The only thing I can guarantee is that JK Rowling had nothing to do with the crafting of this story.

Reading a play is an inherently different experience from reading a novel, of course. Novels like the Potter series are full of rich narration and world building, whereas a play is reliant almost solely on the quality of the dialogue. Nuances in character development and narrative must come to life in the dialogue, even when watching a stage production, because true theater doesn't rely on sets, scenery or special effects. Reading the play should be comprable to seeing it live: of course, quality actors bring it to life, but seeing King Lear in person isn't generally any more powerful than reading the incredible script in your living room.

Was I naive for hoping for this kind of quality? Probably not, considering the playwrights are so accomplished. The dialogue in Rowling's books was, admittedly, not the most compelling, but her narrative and world building made up for it. Absent that, and absent a writer with a gift of crafting character interactions, this book was a massive disaster.

It truly does read like bad fanfiction, with massive leaps of logic and plot holes that are impossible to swallow and one-dimensional, cookie-cutter characters (something I think the Potter books avoided foxily).

As a lifelong Potter fan, I can't really accept this as canon, and I hope that those new to the Potter universe will avoid this chapter in the saga entirely.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have read each book more times than I can count, and know each line of the movie. And, perhaps, that is my downfall with this book. Because as much as this book may have the Harry Potter logo, it cannot ever truly be a work of JK Rowling.
I have heard wonderful reports of this play. However, I believe that therein lies the fault of this book. It was meant to be seen. Not read.
The characters are hollow and two-dimensional. As someone who has read the series several times over, I just can't picture the characters saying the words that they are assigned. (Harry telling his son that he regrets having him? Seriously?) They change the personalities of the characters, changing Ron to a wanna-be funny guy, and Ginny from a strong willed partner, to a push-over.
To make matters worse, Harry's son Albus, the main character, is a brat. End of story. He is mean, selfish, and extremely dramatic.
The stories plot centers around time turners, evoking an old storyline, and bringing back an old enemy, Lord Voldemort. To me, this made the story lack any originality.
Bottom line, this book wasn't what I was expecting.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's worse than bad fan-fiction.","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2018","I would give this book zero stars if I could. First and foremost, because it's not a book. It's a script. Second, it is NOT a Harry Potter book and it was NOT written by JK Rowling. It was endorsed by her and she was consulted for continuity (which seems ridiculous because this book DESTROYS the continuity established in Harry Potter books 1-7).

This review will be chock full of spoilers and I won't feel bad about it one bit. Can you tell I'm bitter? GOOD. Let me tell you why before I get into the reasons this book was a complete disaster. I turned 11 years old on September 1st, 1998. That's right - my birthday is the same day the Hogwarts Express departs Kings Cross to return to Hogwarts. That also means I turned 11 two months after Sorcerer's Stone was published in the United States. I grew up with those books. With the exception of the first book, I went to every single midnight book release and all 8 midnight movie premieres (yes, my parents were cool and took me to the bookstore at midnight when I was 12). I grew up with Harry & co. I AM part of the Harry Potter Generation. These books are my childhood. They mean more to me than I can put into words. While it was bittersweet to close The Deathly Hallows on July 21st, 2007 (because I did go straight home and read the entire thing in one sitting) after reading ""All was well,"" it was with a finality that the series had wrapped up and reached a satisfying conclusion. Okay, the epilogue did feel a bit fan-fictiony but we let that slide for the most part. But overall, Harry Potter fans were content.

From there, we gave hundreds if not thousands of hints to Ms. Rowling that if she was ever so inclined to revisit the wizarding world, we would absolutely ADORE a book series on James Potter and the Marauders' years at Hogwarts. Sirius as a teenager and all of the shenanigans that must have happened - the creation of the marauder's map, the trial and error of becoming animagi, James' shameless attempts at wooing Lily? YES PLEASE. But our pleas fell on seemingly deaf ears. Jo was adamant that she would never write another Harry Potter book. And she didn't. Now comes Cursed Child. I won't even refer to it by it's full name because it doesn't deserve the honor of being introduced as a Harry Potter book.

Imagine my delight when almost 10 years later, the world is quivering with anticipation at the release of ANOTHER HARRY POTTER BOOK! It was common knowledge that there was a stage play by the same name and the story was the same, but it wasn't explicitly mentioned that the book was going to be nothing more than a script of the play. It was marketed as a novel. So at 28 years old, did I go to the bookstore for the midnight release? Of course I did! My husband said he expected nothing less. I clutched that book like it was a portal that would return me to my childhood. I went home and immediately started reading, just as I'd done with the previous installments. My excitement was premature, however, since the longer I read, the angrier and more resentful I became. The story just got worse the further into I got. At any point, I could have just set it aside and said, ""Absolutely not. I won't continue to read this garbage."" But I personally cannot leave a book unfinished. So I finished it. And I hated every bit of it.

Cursed Child is not written by JK Rowling. I mentioned that once before. It is an enormous slap in the face to all the fans of Harry Potter who expected a continuation of the story they came to love so dearly. Now I will list some of the many reasons why it is a complete nightmare (in no particular order because I don't care enough to order them chronologically):

1. The kind, endearing trolly witch who sells sweets on the Hogwarts Express is actually an immortal train guardian who turns pumpkin pasties into grenades and defends the train from intruders. Okay, so where was she when the Dementors attacked the train in Prisoner of Azkaban, then?

2. Adult Ron helps run Weasley Wizard Wheezes and gives his nephew Albus a love potion. This is HIGHLY unlikely since love potions are essentially the wizarding world's equivalent of a date-rape drug and Ron unknowingly took one in their 6th year at school. I seriously doubt he would encourage the use of them after that incident.

3. The ENTIRE mess of the time-turner. To summarize, Albus and Scorpius use a time turner to go back in time to when Harry & co. were students to attempt to change the past. I honestly don't even remember why because I don't care. But the entire thing is ridiculous. Time turners were supposed to have been destroyed when Harry & co. broke into the Department of Mysteries in their 5th year. Hermione had to turn the time turner three times to go back three hours... Albus & Scoripus went back DECADES. Were they just sitting there turning the time turner thousands of times? One of the alternative timelines they create is one where Voldemort wins and rules the world. It's not pretty. But is also makes NO sense.

4. During one of their trips back in time, they messed up the timeline so Hermione didn't trust the Durmstrang students in their 4th year, leading her not to go to the Yule Ball with Viktor, leading Ron not to get jealous, which led to him and Hermione never getting married. That's pretty far fetched and a bit insulting to suggest that jealousy was the only reason Ron had feelings for Hermione. Oh and apparently since Hermione didn't marry Ron, she stayed single and became a DADA professor... and was meaner and more spiteful than Snape. Sorry, what? I find it REALLY hard to believe that Hermione would become this bitter spinster just because she didn't get married.

5. Harry is a terrible father. He actually tells Albus at one point that there are times he wished he didn't have him. First, what father is going to tell his kid that? Maybe a really detached father like Lucius Malfoy, but HARRY FREAKING POTTER would not say that to his kid. Especially when he grew up without parents in a household that didn't love him. Did the author of this monstrosity even open a real Harry Potter book before writing this script? Methinks not.

6. Harry is still a parselmouth. That makes no sense, since he only had that ability from the piece of Voldemort's soul that made Harry an unintentional Horcrux. When Voldemort destroyed that piece of his own soul, Harry should have lost that ability. That's just sloppy writing and poor fact checking.

7. Harry finally landed his dream job of being an Auror and he's like ""ehh, whatever"" about it.

8. In this alternate timeline garbage, Cedric Diggory didn't die in the Triwizard Tournament but instead, became a Death Eater. Yep, you read that right. He also killed Neville during the Battle of Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows. Were the writers just trying to piss off as many HP fans as possible?

9. Teddy Lupin. Remember him? Precious newborn orphan of Remus Lupin and Tonks and godson of Harry Potter? Well, Jack Thorne certainly didn't. Teddy does not appear in this book AT ALL. I get he would be 19 at the time and not at Hogwarts anymore... but it was pretty insulting to leave him out completely.

And the worse and quite possibly the biggest reason why I will never, ever accept this book as canon...

10. Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange had a secret lovechild named Delphi. I can't even begin to explain the reasons why this is not okay, but I'll try. First, the logistics just aren't there. Bellatrix died in the Battle of Hogwarts, so unless she had JUST given birth when exactly was she supposed to have had this child? Bellatrix was devoted to her master, sure, but who thought devotion translated into... that?! Bellatrix was married, or did everyone just forget that detail? Second, Voldemort was incapable of feeling normal human emotion. He thought it beneath him. He was obsessed with being immortal, but HE himself wanted to be immortal. He wouldn't have bought into that whole ""ensuring his bloodline carried on"" because he was making sure HE would never die - so why would he need an heir? The entire concept is just laughable.

The long and short of it is that Cursed Child is worse than fan-fiction. Honestly, that's even an insult to fan-fiction, because I've read plently of fan fics that are exponentially better than Cursed Child. So do yourself a favor - skip this and go to Archive of our Own and read some quality fanfic instead. There's some really great ones out there - ones that keep characterizations true and don't feel the need to take the continuity and put it in a blender. If you do own this book, I'm sorry. Take my lead and remove it from your bookshelves; put it somewhere that you won't have to see it and have the cosntant reminder of it. Lockhart was a terrible wizard, but he was exceptionally good at memory charms. I wish he was around to perform one on me so I could forget this book existed.

I have read and re-read the entire series more times than I can count. I own 8 different sets of the books in a variety of formats so I always have access to them. I had been eagerly looking forward to reading this latest installment in the series and had pre-ordered my copy months ago. That said, words cannot describe how incredibly disappointed I was with this book. I knew it was not a novel. I had accepted that. In fact, that was the least of the problems in the reading. I knew that it was not written entirely by J.K. Rowling. I had, however, assumed (incorrectly, it seems) that since she had given her approval and blessing to the story that it was worthy of her name. I was sadly mistaken.  SPOILER ALERT  Having hoped for a reunion with all the old characters and perhaps an introduction to some new ones, I was very disappointed to see our old friends so flat and out of character. Yes, people change over time, but these were almost resembling the ""Horcrux Harry and Horcrux Hermione"" of the final book in the sense that they were similar to our characters yet horribly different. In this case, they were flat.  They acted and spoke in ways the original characters would never have done. Even the photo of Dumbledore was a caricature of his former self. I read the entire book, however, as I did, I found myself anxious to finish and dispose of it. Canon or no, this will not be joining my beloved sets of books.  I have seen fan fiction that is better than this.  Indeed, it is written like a poorly executed piece of fanfic. There were so many different ways the characters of Albus and Scorpius could have been developed. And why, after having lived in a magical world for so many years where people routinely lived to be hundreds of years old, are the characters dying so young?  We are led to believe that Malfoys are gone, that the parents of many of their former classmates are gone, that professors are gone. I do not understand why this has happened, and there is little in the way of explanation. Overall, I was very disappointed in the writing quality. Perhaps the stage version is richer and more detailed than what we see here, and I truly hope it is, but if given my choice at this moment, I certainly would not pay to see this performed.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This story was a complete disappointment. The script part was fine, no complaints there, but the story and characters within that script are just so awful. How did our beloved characters become so lifeless and at times cruel? How did this plot get approved when it breaks so many rules Rowling herself wrote? I understand playwrights wrote it and only based their story off of Rowling's work, but I don't know how Rowling endorsed it. I have honestly read better fan-fiction on the internet. With that being said, I'm sure this story is lovely when it is performed live. But much like ""A Very Potter Musical"", I refuse to adapt ""Cursed Child"" into the Harry Potter canon.

It was a quick read, but I only pushed through to the end so I could be accurately critique it. As I see it, there are three main problems:
1) The characters are not done any justice. They're unrecognizable. Did the playwright even read the books before he did this?
2) MAJOR continuity problems, both against the backdrop of the original series and within the story itself. Cedric became a Death Eater. The book skipped completely over mentioning that before Scorpius goes to research it. Why did the Trolley Witch chase them out and explain that not even the sneakiest had ever escaped her, and then they just...do...? They can't find Albus and Scorpius. Didn't they use magic when they jumped the train? Don't they have the trace on them? They see the Potters in their house in Godric's Hollow the day they die. The house was protected by the fidelius charm, so they shouldn't be able to see it...right? How did they get the blanket to leave a message on it then get it back to Baby Harry? When exactly was Bellatrix supposed to be pregnant? You know you can't make Polyjuice potion in one afternoon, right? And Voldemort is in power again and everyone is allowed to/not scared to say his name? I could go on, but you get the point. They're amateur writing mistakes.
3) There is none of the zest and humor and gripping plot twists of Rowling's original world. It doesn't read like her and I can't figure out how she got talked into putting her name on it.
I hope it goes off better on stage, but they really shouldn't have tried to milk the cash cow by publishing it.

Fu","Dissapointment","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2016","This book, if you can call it that, is unreadable. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series, both books and movies. I wouldn't classify myself as a fanatic, I can't recite lines or remember the names of each spell but I have always thoroughly enjoyed the series. The first seven books were so well written, Rowling took you on a journey and you felt everything she described. She portrayed each character, big roll or small roll, with all the same detail. You hated Potter's cousin and you could just picture what he looked like each time he spoke.
Fast forward to this book, upon seeing this I was super excited. I pre-ordered on Amazon and counted down the weeks until it arrived. I had already expected a play format (was not enthused) and understood that most likely Rowling did not write much or any of this book but was excited nonetheless. First day, I downloaded the book and started reading and it was completely unreadable. It felt like a poorly written fan fiction, now I don't know if it's because the author or because it's a script. I understand that as it's adapted from a play, the audience can visually see the characters and don't need it described to them. If that's the case, then this book is just a lazy way to make $$$$$$$$$$.
Thorne barely described the characters and I had no idea what Potter's boy looked like. Each character sounded like they were pouting and complaining without any real plot. I ended up reading 20% of this on my Kindle and had to return it. I read the rest of the plot on Wikipedia and it was much more satisfying.
Save your money and time, read the wikipedia version, I think it has more details than this ""book"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling's books. I couldn't  believe how disappointed she was after reading it in one day. She hated this book and said it was the worst book ever by Rowling. She said the character development was poor, story line poor, and all in all, not worth the paper it was printed on. I was shocked because J.K. Rowling is like a god in your home and she has several copies of each and every book in the Potter series.
I didn't read it myself and I am not a potter-head, but my daughter is and I will take her word for it. In fact, she was scheduled to go on an Alaskan cruise and wanted to cancel so she could wait in line at B&N to be among the first to get this book. I spent an hour convincing her that the Alaska trip was a better choice and that I would get the book and have it for her upon her return.  I did and she read it the day after her vacation cruise. Sorry to say folks -- and I mean no disrespect, but JK missed the mark on this one.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Page after page i read knowing it had to stand on it's own merits and not in the shadow of the first 7 books. That my friend... is exactly where it fell short. The story from start to finish, the characters and ultimate outcome is so incredibly lackluster and inconsequential that it breaks my heart. Remove Harry's name from the cover and what you have left is a bland, uninteresting story and characters that you have to struggle to connect with. I wish i could give the book four thumbs down but unfortunately i only have two so that will have to suffice.
Although Harry Potter isn't the main character in this book, and it hardly matters, the story and characters feel lifeless and the finished product feels more like a rough draft that wasn't fully fleshed out.

""It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.""

And lastly, the ""formula"" that worked so well in the original books is nowhere to be found. The universal appeal of Harry Potter is that adults can remember being children and wanting to have magical powers and go on adventures and most present day children want to have magical powers and go on adventures. Who in their right mind, young or old wants to grow up to be an overworked employee that has no time to spend with their family? J.K Rowling and her cohorts have clearly been getting their ideas from the George Lucas School Of How To Destroy Your Own Legend. Sorry for the rant. Very disappointed in what could have been an amazing story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I could not wait, finding out was one of the happiest days of my life. I did not get to attend the midnight release but I'm glad I didn't. This is not Harry Potter, not even a tiny bit, it's not even good fanfiction, I have read much better. If it was fanfiction and I'd  have read the description and have passed it right on by. I am beyond disappointed in this book's storyline and treatment of characters, I was prepared for the script read which takes a lot away so I never expected it to be the literary masterpiece the other books were but this goes far beyond that. This goes beyond disappointment, this book destroys the Harry Potter world as we know it, nothing is the same, all the rules have been changed and turned on their heads. I've seen so many spoilers and it doesn't even bother me, they can't ruin it because I hate this book, it is awful. I wanted to make it through it because I feel you should be knowledgeable about something if you want to have an opinion on it, but just a quarter of the way through (all of which has been agonizing and forced, making me not want to read for the first time in my life) I don't know if I can go on. It has already done enough damage to the wonderful Harry Potter that I hold so dear. This is not the Harry Potter that taught us compassion and understanding, that the world isn't black and white, the importance of friendship, love, and loyalty, that made our generation one of the most tolerant and had both children and adults who hated reading doing exactly that.

I've read most of them 10+ times. This script was pure garbage. It really was not even the fact that it was a script that made it so terrible. That dialogue was just awful. None of the lines seem like anything any of the characters would really ever say. Everything seemed off. The plot was forced and awful, and nothing flowed. The lines were absurd, particularly Ron's lines. If someone had not read the original books they would read this one and think Ron was mentally handicapped. This book not only fails to add to my love of the Potter world, but it detracts from it. This is the most disappointing book I have ever read in my life. JK Rowling was a genius in the first 7 books, and in some of the accompanying small books. This doesn't even seem like she wrote ANY of it. Any competent college student with macbook could have written another book. I'm SO mad that when JK Rowling finally released another Potter book/script that it was this bad. She either has lost her touch, or is a total sell out for the money. Shame on you JK Rowling.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I also grow up with Harry Potter.

It was so obvious that J.K. Rowling, even though her name's written the biggest, has so little to do with the script.

EVERYONE WAS SO OUT OF CHARACTER. Every dialogue was unnatural and the plot is as ridiculous as a Boggart. Do they really want us to believe that Draco, as kind as he has become, has the pride to admit that he was envious of Harry's friendship?! That Ron is a useless moron who crack jokes all the time without offering any help?! That Hermione is as useless as Ron, just with more dialogues?! That Harry isn't getting along with his son just because Albus is different when Harry himself was different his entire life?!

The plot has many plot holes and doesn't even add up to the previous stories. It feels like the writers are some amateurs writing a fan fiction online. I don't mind whether this is a script or a novel, but to call this an OFFICIAL continuation of Harry Potter is just trash. I'm going to treat this as I treat Mean Girls 2, this book never existed.

But, hey, if you want to get nostalgic, just buy it.

I hate paying for shipping and will go out of my way to avoid it 2. I am a massive Harry Potter Fan. In fact, in preparation of reading this book I reread all the Harry Potter books. Not that I wasn't going to anyway, but it was a lovely excuse. Moving on, I have decided not only to return this book, but to pay money to return it. It cannot sit on my shelf amongst the other HP books. I refuse. There are basically three reasons why this book is not a HP book and after I have returned it and finished this review I am going to promptly forget it ever existed:
1. This is not written nor does it sound like JK Rowling. This ""story"" may have been ""based on a JK Rowling story"" but it just does not seem like it. It truly seems more like a poorly developed fan fic. JK Rowling is seamless, sophisticated. She doesn't allow for many mistakes to be made. It often felt like whoever wrote this play didn't even read the HP books but merely watched the movies. Big Mistake.
2. The story is poorly developed and poorly executed. As I mentioned, there are a ton of mistakes made. I won't go into them as other reviews have beautifully listed them. So if you want a list of all the mistakes made and the impossibilities according to previous books, look at some of the other longer reviews.
3.  The characters, our characters, our beautiful trio, does not sound/act/speak or do anything like they generally would. Ron is an imbecile throughout this novel, Hermione isn't terribly bright, Harry isn't himself, not at all, and the new characters we are introduced to aren't well developed.  The author (whoever it is) doesn't mention key characters like Teddy. Not to mention the direction they do go in with the plot is just beyond ridiculous. The author seems to spend more time on Cedric Diggory than he does on Ron or Hermione.

While reading this book I continued to keep in mind that this book is written as a play, that reading a play is different from reading a novel, and that as a play you will not get the same emotional insight as you would in a novel. Apparently it is very good watching this play on stage. However, as a book, I cannot and do not like this and for me, it is not ""the next installment"" but a poorly written and poorly developed fan fic turned into a play. I am so disappointed. I can't even believe JK Rowling approved this for publication.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_97?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=97&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I even write fanfiction myself. A lot of people like to say that those who don't like it don't understand that it's a play and not a novel. As an English Literature major I know how to appreciate a play, this just fails on so many levels. Plot, inconsistencies with canon in the original Harry Potter series, beloved characters that are completely out of character. I don't care if J.K. Rowling gave it her stamp of approval, it's just utterly disappointing. However, by all means buy it for yourself and decide for yourself, while I don't like it, I read through it rather quickly and it was fun to read (and I absolutely love Albus and Scorpius in this) so I'm not trying to discourage anyone from reading this but don't go into it expecting it to be like what you're used to.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

However, it is more fan fiction than anything else. I would not want to add it to my Harry Potter collection. I have pre-ordered all seven books and movies, as well as having the audiobooks. The integrity of the characters and J. K. Rowling have been assaulted, in my opinion. With the exception of Hermione, none of the characters held true to the originals. Jack Thorne and John Tiffany have destroyed the characters we grew to love and some even despise. In my opinion, J. K. Rowling could not have assisted with the writing of this play as it doesn't hold true to the seven books she wrote on Harry Potter. The story is a good one, but it is not a true Harry Potter book that could be or should be added to the HP collection. If you are a fan, you may want to read it and form your own opinion, but here is mine.

SPOILER ALERT:

The play begins nineteen years later at the end of the Deathly Hallows book. We see Albus Severus Potter concerned about getting placed in the Slytherin house. And that's about where it ends in connection with the book.

None of the characters remain true to their identities as we have known them. Yes, they have aged and with age should come wisdom. Alas, Harry states that he did not have a father figure, which we know to be untrue. There's Dumbledore, Arthur Weasley, Sirius Black (though short-lived), and Remus Lupin, just to name a few. He knew how he would not treat his children as the Dursleys had treated him so for him to tell Albus that he wished Albus wasn't his child is so out of character for Harry that it borders on disgusting and a true insult to the Harry Potter we knew and loved due to his moral integrity. Yes, I can see Hermione becoming Minister of Magic, but what of Harry becoming an Auror? And why is Ron running the joke shop? What happened to George? And no mention of Teddy - Remus Lupin's and Tonk's son whom was raised by Andromeda Tonks, his maternal grandmother, along with Harry since he was his godfather? Not to mention there was no mention of Hugo - Hermione's and Ron's son?

Harry's integrity comes into question almost immediately when Albus gets into the Slytherin house, which I did enjoy. Yet, during all the time changes because of the time turner, Harry almost berates Albus for thinking he is in the Slytherin house rather than the Gryffindor house, as if no son of his would be caught in such a house. At the end of Deathly Hallows, Harry states to Albus that Slytherin would be lucky to have such a fine child in their house.

The portraits: As we Harry Potter fans know, they are much more than memory and paint as Headmaster McGonagall states to Harry in this play/book. Harry speaks to Dumbledore's portrait in the end of Deathly Hallows and Dumbledore knows what is happening at that moment, not to mention speaking to Severus Snape in trying to help Harry retrieve the sword in order to get rid of the horcruxes. So why does Dumbledore seem like an unfamiliar figure in his portrait when Harry is talking to him in the Hogwarts hospital. Even Phineas Black knew what was happening from his portrait, whether it be from the Black house or in Hermione's bag or in the Headmaster's Office.

Ron: Ron was a great character and was loyal to his friends and family, yet in this book he plays the fool. He was so very different than the character J. K. Rowling wrote about that one can only question exactly how much input did she actually give in this play/book or did Jack Thorne and John Tiffany just lend her name to promote their play. Why was he not working not in the Ministery of Magic, either following his dad's footsteps or becoming an Auror or some other position? Why is he running the joke shop? What happened to George? Either he was telling jokes or being one of the three remaining Dumbledore's Army and not good at that as well. Only rare instances appear with Ron, where once he was part of the trio we came to adore. He played big parts in the seven book, yet in this one he is minimized as a fool. And Ron getting drunk when he is marrying Hermione? He never would have insulted her in that way. He cared for her too much. Fortunately, their affection for each other remained throughout the play, whether they were together or not depending upon the changes made by the time turner.

Hermione: While she was probably the only character who held true to the character we knew, her actions and reactions were very un-Hermione in places, especially when she became a Defense of the Dark Arts teacher and acted more like Snape.

Harry's relationship with Albus is very disturbing and very much unlike Harry who wanted to have a family of his own. Even in Deathly Hallows, you could feel the love that radiated from him towards Albus. In this play/book, he is cold and distant with him, though the same could not be said about James. Harry knew from the Dursleys how he not to treat a child, yet with Albus he actually tells him that he wished he wasn't his son! This is not the Harry we knew as he knew about friendship, loyalty, and most importantly love for it was his mother's love that saved him in the beginning. It was the love of Dumbledore that had us crying each and every time we read, saw, or heard Dumbledore dead. It was his love for Sirius. It was his love that allowed him to defeat Voldemort. This was so saddening to me that I almost had to put down the book. This was not Harry Potter. He, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron would have imparted onto their children. For him to separate Albus and Scorpius, knowing what good friends they were, would have been unlikely for the true Harry Potter. He chose friendship over suspicion. As he told Draco Malfoy on his first day at Hogwarts, he could tell for himself the right kind of person. This play/book mutilates the Harry Potter we knew - his principles, his love, his sacrifices for what is good and right.

Delphi: Really? Voldemort wouldn't have tried to conceive a child with anyone, though Bellatrix would have been the proper choice had he not cared for anyone else but himself. He thought himself greater than all and needed no one else to rely on unless it was to preserve himself in some fashion (i.e. Quirrell and Wormtail). After all, he had his horcruxes to live on eternally (or so he thought). Moreover, once he realized that the horcruxes were being destroyed and if he did actually mate with Bellatrix, she DIED! Therefore, Delphi could never have come into being.

Lucius Malfoy: How did he get out of Azkaban so he could have a time turner made for him? Why would they have released him? Did he escape? Where were the headlines of such an escape? Because of this, no time turner would have ever existed since the rest had all been destroyed. Therefore, the story goes away since Albus and Scorpius couldn't have gone back in time several times to try and save Cedric.

Cedric Diggory: Because he lost the Tri-wizard Tournament, he turned into a Death Eater? This was a kid who was kind and good and maintained virtue until the very end.

Rose Granger-Weasley: Really? She turned into a bully and determined to despise someone because of whom their father was? The true Hermione would never teach her children this attitude despite Ron's telling her to beat him on tests and not to marry him. Even in this part of the Deathly Hallows book, Hermione rectifies this because the past is the past and the son is not the father, which not only turns out to be true in this play/book (I like Scorpius) but Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up befriending Draco - again something that I liked.

Not to mention that Polyjuice Potion takes a MONTH to make!

There are things that I enjoyed about the story, however.

I do love that Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up being friends. I like the fact that Draco admits he envied the friendship the three of them had while he only had Crabbe and Goyle, who were not true friends but just underlings because of who his father was.

I like the fact that Harry had the blanket that he was bundled into when laid upon the Dursleys' steps.

I like the fact that we got to see snippets of Harry's childhood from a young age before reaching eleven years of age.

I like the fact that Harry got to witness how his parents loved and adored him and even watched while they were killed because he knew he couldn't stop the events, knowing that messing with time can do vast damage.

There is a story in here just waiting for J. K. Rowling to write, but it must be her since no one else could do it justice as well as she. As this play/book proves, the rest is all just fan fiction that doesn't stay true to the people we read, saw, and heard and fell in love with. Now it's up to her to rectify this travesty and as a Harry Potter fan, I hope she does so we can forget this mockery.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have grown up immersed in the story and was thrilled to hear that there would be a new addition! Preordered the book months in advance and started reading as soon as it arrived.

That, my friends, is where the magic died. I knew going in that this was a script and would not be formatted like the original 7 had been. But what really stakes the heart of readers will be the complete lack of character continuity, terrible dialogue, and disjointed storylines. To be honest this read as a really really poorly written fanfic. A fanfic by someone who may or may not have read the preceding books, someone who has never written creatively before, and someone who thought Rowling's story should include random and unexplained instances of what can only be described as science fiction.

Having to think about what I read while writing this review gets me enraged all over again. I simply hope that the movie version of this will remain truer to the ""real"" Harry Potter than this utter waste of ink and paper.

Well to start I don't know how the hell Rowling let this thing get made into a play or why she had someone else right it when she should be writing every single chronicle in the Wizarding World Canon, and it's because of this that many people probably don't consider this canon.  Then the painful truth is this book shouldn't be considered canon for the franchise.  While I'm rambling about it this book does nothing that the epilogue setup, yes it has the first scene where it's almost copy pasted but WHY THE HELL WOULD  YOU SETUP THE BOOK IN THE ENTIRELY WRONG WAY.  Thanks to some chats I had with friends at like 4 in the Morning after reading this we all agreed on a few key plot points that would've made this book much better (spoiler warning):
1) Albus should've been selected for Griffindor but had to go through the same identity crisis thing that Harry went through in the second book to better show the relationship between Harry and Albus (also this would've allowed for better development of the potter family as well as some of the side characters
2) Rose Granger-Weasley shouldn't have been just a do it all character, she falls flat in the play because she doesn't have insecurities like literally everybody else in the play, she just comes off as this God like student that despite her parents flaws she has literally nothing to be afraid of.  This would've also given Rose a chance to become part of whatever the hell the theme was for this book
3) Time Turners that go back more then an hour, are you serious...THERE ARE SO MANY PLOT HOLES BECAUSE JACK F****** THRONE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO USE F****** TIME TURNERS THAT CAN ACTUALLY GO BACK IN TIME MORE THEN A COUPLE OF HOURS!  This is probably the biggest flaw of the play that hinders it so much in the long run (but there are a bunch of other things that are on par with this).  Literally 5/8 of the play revolves around the Time Traveling aspect, which in my opinion Jack Throne just watched Back to the Future and called it good on his time travel research.  The whole aspect follows Albus, Scorpious, and the new Character Delphi as they try to save Cedric's life during Harry's 4th Year in order to fulfill Delphi's goal of bringing back the Dark Lord...BUT WHY THE HELL WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMELINE IF DIGGORY WAS NOT KILLED, HE WOULD'VE FOUGHT VOLDEMORT WITH HARRY AT THE CEMETERY OR JUST STAYED BEHIND AND FOUGHT WITH HARRY IN HIS 5TH AGAINST UMBRIDGE AND AT THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS!  and the worst part about all of this is...THAT THE BOOK EVEN SAYS THAT THE TWO IMPORTANT MOMENTS IN THE TIMELINE ARE NEVEL VS. NIGINI AND VOLDEMORT TRYING TO KILL HARRY AS A CHILD SO WHY THE HELL DOES DELPHI, THE MAIN VILLAN, WANT TO SAVE CEDRICS LIFE IF THAT MEANS HARRY COULD HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND TO HELP HIM!  Now there are a few cameos in the script by Amos Diggory asking to see his son again, which makes no since because in the 4th book onward Amos accepted his son's fate and wanted to support Harry from far away because he couldn't stand knowing he had seen his son die.  Anyway the last thing I have to say about the time travel thing is that it was completely thrown in at the last minute and wasn't developed at all in the way it should've been (like in the 3rd book)  (Also there was other stuff I should've mentioned about Time travel and the other time lines but that is like an essay on its own because everything is so bad so just don't bother trying to understand it)
4) How, when the book is called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, do you mess up the original Harry Potter crew so badly!  This just makes me so sad to see the characters wasted on such a horrible idea.  Harry's character is a rough mix between Adult Harry and like 5th Year Harry.  And if you want to know something super interesting Jack paraphrased scenes from the original books into the play that aren't set in the past but just put into a new scenario, try to find them all I guess.  Anyway, Harry's actions reflect that of him in his 5th year, yet his voice in the words on the play sounds so adultish bland if that was a color.  Jack, you ruined one of the best characters of the 21st Century.  Hermione doesn't carry any of the traits she had from the original books over, she just kinda repeats what everyone says and is a horrible Minister of Magic.  Ron ironically has the most interesting and funny scenes of the play (he wasn't even in the scene mind you) where he sends a Comb to James which turns his hair pink when he combs it, that got a chuckle out of me I'll admit it.  Then comes Draco who is just an egotistical prick all the time, for some reason even though he shouldn't be.  Also we have an appearance from Snape, whose character got washed out but is nice to see that he is still the good guy under all of that Snape that we know and love (just saw Alan Rickman in my head playing this Snape and it made me kinda sad).  Dumbledore is here too, but it's not the bad ass movie Dumbledore, it's the I'm kinda goofy Dumbledore from the books and he is there to give Harry parenting advice from experiences...he had...with...Harry..?  Did Jack even read the last book?  You do realize that Dumbledore used Harry as a way to kill the Dark Lord despite what would've happened to Harry.  And he didn't really care it was just raising him like a pig to the slaughter.  Also where is the Professor Snape portrait cause I wanna see that too.
5) Then the biggest notable problem with this whole book...Albus.  Albus is such a dry unrelateable piece of literary garbage.  He literally is on his period throughout the entire book and takes all his anger out on his dad for...putting...him...in...Slytherin..?  Why is he mad about that.  And do you know what's so funny it's not at all, freakin Scorpio is more like Harry and much more entertaining then Albus even comes close too.  The book goes through like 3 years and then the beginning of his fourth year at Hogwarts.  I'm just so sad that they ruined a character I was genuinely excited to see.

Well, in conclusion, Rowling if you are out there.  Happy Birthday btw, but more importantly don't let other people write your stories for you.  You should be the one and only person to do so if this catastrophe has taught the fans anything.  I mean there is a part of me that wants Jack to shoot himself  for the giant big mistake that he created in the form of this screenplay.  But hey, you only had 9 years to make an actually good sequel to the Harry Potter series and it probably should've been 10.  So don't buy this book, because it is so awful and you are better off just not experiencing this Tarnish to an otherwise amazing series.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This reads like a bad teen fan-fiction.

First of all, the characters are unlikable.Albus is way to moody.  Imagine Harry in OOTP squared.  Also, I can't believe that anyone as nasty as Rose could be the child of Ron and Hermione.  The new characters introduced are one dimensional.  Surprisingly, the bright spot is the Malfoys.  It's nice to see some personal growth.

Second, they contradict the way time-turners work as described in POA.  In that book, Harry and Hermione go back and time to make sure events played out exactly as they did the first time.  In the Cursed Child, they play fast and loose with the time line to create some highly implausible scenarios.

Third, without spoiling  too much, they refer to things that take place during the timeline of the novels that simply couldn't have happened.

Finally SPOILER ALERT the antagonist is Tom Riddle's secret love child?  REALLY?  Gross factor aside, Voldemort was the antagonist in 5/7 of the novels.  Couldn't we have gone another direction?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_80?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=80&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am a major Potter fan, and have been happily addicted since I was eight years old.

Not only do I want a refund for my money, I also want a refund for the time I spent waiting for this.
The dialogue was terrible, and the characters of the Harry Potter we know and love did not exist in this play. Everything Harry, Ron and Hermione said or did was completely out of character.
I won't give examples so as not to spoil it for anyone who might have actually liked this. Except one-pigeons???? What in the world? I'm sorry but no. Harry is not afraid of pigeons.

The plot was unoriginal. I've read dozens of unprofessional Harry Potter fan fictions with the the same exact one.
There were too many continuity errors to count.

I spent good money on this, and I'm restraining myself from throwing it in the trash. Harry Potter fans deserved a better story than this.
Of course a play or movie adaptation of a book will have differences. That's obvious. But this? I don't know what this was, but one thing's for sure.

I avoided spoilers before reading this play, but went in having heard the storyline was absurd and that seeing the play was worth it for the effects and staging. I didn't have very high expectations going in, and I already knew the facts: it was a play that wasn't actually written by J.K. Rowling and it was most certainly not going to be Harry Potter #8.

That being said, I was quite frustrated when I finished reading. It took me less than 2 hours to read through this, and with each new twist I became increasingly confused as to how JKR could've approved this story. The characters have the same names as the ones in the HP series, and some of the magic is the same, but the play is completely inconsistent with canon. The characters seem like different people in many cases, and usually the version in the play is worse. For example, Ron is a worse version of movie-Ron. Things that were carefully detailed in the books are thrown away for gimmicks. Many aspects of the story come off as badly-executed fan service.

Maybe seeing the play would make this more tolerable, but the story itself isn't what you'd expect for the HP universe. If you feel like you should read the story out of completeness as an HP fan (which is why I bought the book), I'd recommend trying to borrow it from the library (or at least not paying full price for the hardcover edition).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_156?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=156&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I've literally read each book minus deathly Hallows over 40 times and this is DEFFINATELY not book 8. I was expecting a play write so anyone saying that's the only downside needs to read the original story and get some facts right. Why put an epilogue at the end of book 7 if you're going to basically ignore simple facts. SPOILER ALERT!!

I love the fact albus joins slytherin. That's a good twist I wasn't expecting being the Gryffindor that I am. What happened to Ron working as a auror and why Is he running the joke shop. Not to mention George is nowhere to  be seen. The trolley lady..... I'll just leave that there. Not worth a description. Main thing that could never even happen is how does Bella husband even get outta Azkaban? There's no way he was pardoned and he's in this ""play"" like nothing happened. There's no possible way voldemort would even have a kid. There was never intamacy in his life. He made sure to tear that part out of his soul. Harry would never seperate his kids from there friends.

The script advertised on the book jacket is not an insert or an add on.  This is the script for the play, blown up the book print, and jacketed and sold.

And that galls me.

The first lesson my writing professor drilled into us is that you don't write a book in script format.  Even if you are writing a script, your should probably do it is a treatment in sparse prose form first.  Beyond that, would it have been that hard to have someone convert the script to prose form for publishing?

Not that they should have bothered.  This is Harry Potter in name only.  Multiple laws of magic set up in the Potterverse are violated without so much as a lampshade hung on them.  The villain is obvious, and only one slight twist in her plot makes it less than completely obvious.  And because it is a script, the narrative is sparse and uneventful.

Looking forward to Fantastic Creature, but I recommend any Harry Potter fans think hard about how desperate they are before shelling out for this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I think the plot idea was good but the characters were flat. They all talked the same way and there was way too much love and crying.  I cannot imagine how this even got published. Nor can I believe Ms  Rowling would think so little of her fans to allow something this dissappointing to have her name associated with it. She is an excellent writer so I am truly baffled.

Usually I can find positives in any work of literature but this one is a record for me. If you are thinking of buying this book please think before you purchase. It really changed how I look at the Harry Potter series.

I am really surprised that J.K. Rowling would allow this ""book/play"" to be released. If you read the cover correctly and carefully it was based on the books written by J.K. Rowling, and not written by. It was written by two other people entirely with Rowlings blessing. In my opinion, the only reason this was allowed to happen was because Rowling lost a massive bet. I never thought she would sell out like this. After all, in the past she has been so maticilious about her characters in theme parks and movies. Harry Potter should have ended with book 7 and left alone. Yes us fans would love new books, but not at the cost of the characters doing a complete 180 on their personalities. Yes the characters are allows to grow and change with age, but certain characters will not change THAT much.

When I read that J.K. Rowling had assisted in this, I was truly excited, thinking that I'd once again be taken back to this wonderful world. I envisioned reliving childhood experiences of losing myself in Hogwarts, imagining that I was there with all these characters that I hold close to my heart.

Unfortunately, this book takes all the magic away. The way these loveable characters are portrayed in quite the opposite: Harry is a disillusioned and angry man, Ginny is God knows what, Hermione's intelligence and wit are gone, and Ron's a backdrop, with no lines with substance, just to name a few.

Along with all the timeline errors, and mistakes in the stories, none of these characters' personalities are the same as the previous books. The storyline itself feels inaccurate, rushed, and not thought out at all.

I really wanted to love this book, because I wanted a chance to travel back to that world, but these aren't J.K. Rowling's characters. These aren't their personalities, their courage, their stories.

If I could give this zero stars, I definitely would.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"
