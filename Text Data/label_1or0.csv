2667,"I wanted to love this, I really did. I'm as starved for new Harry Potter content as any other fan, but this book is sadly disappointing. I think the thing that disappoints me most is the lack of continuity among characters from the original series. None of the original characters keep their personalities or traits in this book. They just don't have the same feel. Hermoine talks to Ron like a child, Ginny and Harry are nothing similar to who they were in the original series. The characters I loved in the HP series are gone, replaced by some loosely related, poorly written shadows, really only the same in name.  I've read other reviews that say this book is like poorly written fan fiction, and I must say I agree. There is nothing connecting this book the the original series. The story is convoluted, the plot is disorganised and at times pointless. There is no trace of the magic and passion with which JK Rowling wrote the HP series. It's a scattered,  pointless mess. It takes away all of the feelings left at the end of HP, when you're left staring into a future unmarred by Voldemort, wondering or hoping or writing a continuation of your own,  and replaces it with a story unfitting to the original series. And unfortunately, it vastly fails to match the feeling, magic, or effort given to thr HP series. What a shame.",0,0,0

3697,"Fun and fast read.  I found this to be a fun story, however less believable at times than Rowling's first 7 books. This is probably due to the fact that there is much less detail in a script when compared to the original books. As a play I can see where they can fill in those details with talented acting and set props to make it very entertaining. This book reminds me more of an outline for a full story. I was hoping for more details about their lives over the past 19 years but not much was offered. Instead it really built upon the friendship of albus and scorpius and their complicated relationships with their fathers.  Overall a fun read and just enough of a peak into the current life of Harry Potter to satisfy curiosity. Would definitely recommend to harry potter fans. As for those who haven't read the books yet (maybe you have been hiding under a rock for the last 15 years) they are definitely worth reading before diving into this one because absolutely nothing will make sense to you if you have not read the books.",1,1,1

My biggest negative after reading this as a Harry Potter fan was that the dialogue of the returning Harry Potter characters (Harry, Hermoine, Ron, etc.) felt very unnatural to the characters from the original series. I understand that Harry is now in his late 30s, early 40s in this play but there were times when I was reading his lines, and other returning characters' lines, where it just felt like that isn't something that character would say. There was also some dialogue that was really ""cheesy"" and felt like the writer was trying to force a laugh which made the line seem unnatural.

It is also missing the descriptive quality that made the original series so good, I understand it's a play and that quality would be lacking a bit but it was almost entirely absent in the scene descriptions.

The story line was pretty predictable (even the ""twist"" at the end was predictable) and was used much more effectively in other movies that had used it before.

I hope this review helps and I didn't spoil anything. I think any Harry Potter fan will check this out regardless of the reviews, as I did. But, if you're new to the Harry Potter series please read the original series and don't make this your first impression of Harry Potter.",0,0,0

First of all, all the old characters lost their identity. They are not our Harry, Hermoine and Ron. There is huge change on Draco's being.

And Story was not exciting at all. It was all cliché.

I don't accept the fact that because of this is play it needs to support by actual play. When I read Shakespeare, I never needed to see play to understand characters' struggle, joy or regrets.

Instead of a fresh, exciting new story in the wondrous world of HP (which one could argue there are THOUSANDS of new directions this story could have taken), we are forced to revisit old plots with time traveling.

When I first heard a continuation to the series was coming out, I was excited.  I thought we would finally get the ending that the Harry Potter series deserved; I honestly did not think anything could be worse than the rushed epilogue of ""The Deathly Hollows""....I was wrong.
 I tried to be objective going into this book.  Honestly, while I have reread all the books multiple times and have  seen all the movies, I would not consider myself one of the many rabid  Harry Potter fans.  I recognized this was an adaptation to the story, so I was not looking for continuation errors.  It did not bother me that details in the books were overlooked and missing in ""The Cursed Child"".  It did not bother me that they made the Trolley Witch bonkers and Harry Potter's kid obnoxious.  What bothered me is they murdered the characters that made the Harry Potter stories great. It's a sad day when Draco Malfoy is the only decent original character in the story.
 Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione where nothing like the characters in the original books. The heart of the original stories failed to be transmitted into ""The Cursed Child"".  There was nothing about any of the characters that made you love them, root for them, or even wish them dead.  The dialog was forced and one-dimensional. While the Harry Potter series were technically children/young adult novels, this story, above all the others, felt like it was truly geared towards young children. It was cheesy line after cheesy line, cliché after cliché.  By the end, I was even okay with the bad guys  winning - at least then, the story may have some oomph behind it.  But alas, the book managed to go all the way to the end without any redeeming characteristics.  The only reason I did not give this a one-star is it has the potential for actors to break the one-dimensionality of this script in a live production.

Firstly, can we talk about how the Sorting Hat is totally out of order? Scorpius went first, then Albus? What even? Also... Bellatrix being pregnant is a big no no. She would be heavily pregnant in Malfoy Manor where she tortured Hermione if she was pregnant.

I dislike how they portrayed Harry. He's so weak in this, it's obvious he is not trying his best! He lost when fighting Delphi: REALLY!?

I really wanted to see Sirius when they used the Time Turner :( perhaps, when Hogwarts is all Death Eater zone and all, after Cedric supposedly won, Sirius survives and is on a truce with Snape? Hmm, would like to see how that would work out though.

2831,"SPOILERS! BE WARNED!

When first introduced to the Harry Potter series, I really thought nothing of it-literaly- , that the amount of fame it had gotten at the time was, well, crazy.
 But after reading  even the first few pages I instantly got hooked and have adored the series ever since then.
Now when I heard a few months prior to the opening date that there was a new Harry Potter book, I was just thrilled!
But after reading page after page my excitement started to turn dull, and I couldn't feel the vibe I usually felt when opening up one of J.K Rowling's HP books.
Of course, I kept in mind that it wasn't the original author who wrote this book, and that was probably the biggest problem about this book.
Even if you bring in the seemingly best writer in the world to continue a book, there will most certainly be a change in the atmosphere of the book.
Harry Potter, the one thing in the world he wanted was a family, and he can't give up ministry work time to spend time with the only one he has now?
Hermione and Ron's daughter, Rose, judging a 'book by its cover' before even knowing the person.
That's not what either the parents would ever teach their children.
Look, the format of this book was 'alright'- a bit kidish to me- but I am only saying it was alright solely because of Snape.
But the characters weren't really truly there.
I felt as though throughout the whole book everything was monotone, just a robot talking, and that- as weird as it is to say- did break my heart a bit that these wonderful characters were wasted.
There was no joyful, scary, sinister, homey, evil, and AMAZING feeling in this book at all. But I need, really really need J.K Rowling to rewrite this herself.
No shade on the two new authors, but you can't just write someone else's book without making it your own, and not everyone wants that..
Hope this was alright.",1,0,0

I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the Harry Potter series,1,1,1

My dad bought it for me for my birthday and I couldn't wait to read it.....and it was horrible. Scorpius and Albus both lack any sort of depth. They're bratty spoiled upper middle class kids that think they know everything.

118,"I am happy i bought this overall... The book itself is not in any way written by j.k. Rowling. Do not expect her style of writing. It is however approved by her so i feel that's an important point to note.

This on my opinion is a fantastic book to have it you are a true Harry potter fan. It dives into the young Albus' life. And tells a different kind of story than Harry potter ever was. It is not about Harry anymore, but about his son. It is a lot about their bonds and how harry is learning to be a father now at this point in life.

It's the first time i have ever read a play besides in school. I read it in one day. It is not a long book. I mean it's like 300 pages but the text is spread out quite a bit. I had a great time reading it too... After starting, and this is the reason for four stars, it got slightly confusing with the quick flying through the years of Albus' life. I did not enjoy that particular part of the book very much and that's the point where i really noticed the different writing styles the most. i thought to myself i never would have gotten through all the Harry potter books of they were anything like that. I feel it could have been some thing like, beginning at Hogwarts, giving the background needed to get the story then go on to four years later and tell the story. That part was annoying and it's something i knew was going to end and i was just like, okay when will it be done. That is the only critical thing i have to say about the book. Which is pretty good since I'm choosy about my books. The screen play does not bother me a bit, I actually felt more there in the story than a lot of other books.  The story itself was great, i thought the characters were spot on,the personalities perfect, ups and downs and stuff i didn't expect but that added to the story so much. i love the overall additions this adds to the HP library... I still separate the Harry potter books in my head from this book but it's probably just because i have only read it once so far. I ummm love Harry potter, it's the best series i have ever read. I can read the books over and over.

AS a side note; I watched a documentary type deal on j.k. Rowlings decision to allow Jack Thorne and John tiffany to make this and she said she refused dozens of offers over the course of years before allowing any third party people touch her Harry Potter story. She did not decide on this book lightly. It is a great story and i would say a must of you are a Harry potter fan like i am. Even if it's separate In your head from up you'll be glad you read it, i was anyway. Hope this helps someone to decide. It's money will a on my opinion.... Also where else are you going to get an entire days worth of entertainment for $10??? Worth it!",1,1,1
886,"I was a little leery of this book at first, haven not been written by J.K. Rowling. And it being in script form was a little clunky and hard to get used to at first, but in the end I loved this book.",1,1,1
3371,"This is the Phantom Menace equivalent to the Harry Potter series. An absolute disgrace to the Potter name.

I can't even begin to tell you how uncomfortable most of the dialogue makes me. What's worse is the series of events that Albus Potter and his friend Scorpius Malfoy get themselves into...I wanted to strangle them.

And that's too bad, because seeing them become friends and grow together was occasionally touching...but wow, they do some stupid s***! Stupid beyond any rationality, just unforgivably stupid things that are up there with the Three Stooges.

The best scenes are probably between Harry and Albus, but even those leave me feeling mixed. I feel like the strongest point of this story is the development of Harry as a father. It's understandable that a guy who was raised most of his life without parents would hit a few bumps in the road when being a parent himself.

I also think the dialogue of Hermione, Draco, Ginny, and a few brief scenes with Dumbledore's portrait are good. Unfortunately, the story is more focused on revisiting the past, which deducts time for us to get acquainted with new characters or new magical phenomena (like we normally get in other Potter installments). It's got too much fan-service for my taste, which bums me out.The whole damn thing reads like fan-fiction.

I can only imagine at this time how beautiful a live performance must be, but it will never be forgiven for the LOADS of retconning and TACKY plot devices that make a joke out of this once reputable franchise

Despite a few good scenes here and there, it's a total farce. It plays out more like a bad TV miniseries on the Disney channel.

If counted in the series, it's undoubtedly the worst. But for the sanctity of my Harry Potter experience, I'd rather consider this a ""what if?"" story. And as long as there's no movie or official novelization of the script, I think that's a fair assessment. This script wasn't even written by JK.",0,0,0

I truly would love to see the play in person. I really enjoyed reading this book!!",1,1,1
1693,"I clearly remember the I discovered Harry Potter. I don’t remember my age, but I do recall the place. My Dad took us to Barnes & Noble in Little Rock, AR. I couldn’t find a book I wanted to read. Seeing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone on a cardboard display, Dad pointed to it. That night, I discovered never-ending magic.

Or so I thought. Let’s be frank, shall we? I pride myself on my ability to remain unbiased when writing a review about a book. Sometimes I’m friends with the author, sometimes I’m asked to cover it, sometimes I choose to. No matter what manner brings this book to me, I’m honest. I will remain the same with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. That said, this book sucks.

To put into perspective how much this book sucks, let me put it this way: I dropped it. The only other book I haven’t finished is Outlander. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on work by Rowling, but it is not a Harry Potter book. Not in the sense that those of us who grew up with it see it, anyways. When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I felt as much excitement as the next fan. After attempting to read it, I chose to leave the series where it ended in Deathly Hollows.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not so much a continuation of the series as it is a fan-fiction. And while there is good fan-fiction out there, this is not an example of it. This book (or screenplay) is a desperate attempt to continue a completed series. Not only does it fail to breathe life back into the friends of our childhood, but it does so with a timeline restrained by rules of the theater.

Even worse, the friendship that blossoms between Albus and Scorpio seems too farfetched. It’s as if the screenwriters sought yet another retelling of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. A retelling that doesn’t do the pair justice, from what others that forced themselves to finish the book have told me. The only thing I find worse than romance in a story is a romance that falls short of its potential.",1,0,1

I will say that I enjoyed the way they played on the expectations of the reader.

Then, I realized that's exactly what Harry's problem was with his son. He expected him to live up to the family name through some kind of inherited reputation, but the fact is that he hates school and is kind of a loner.

It seemed like he was only there for a laugh but in the original stories he became so much more of a hero. I did think Scorpius was a good character, though.

That, my friends, is where the magic died. I knew going in that this was a script and would not be formatted like the original 7 had been. But what really stakes the heart of readers will be the complete lack of character continuity, terrible dialogue, and disjointed storylines. To be honest this read as a really really poorly written fanfic. A fanfic by someone who may or may not have read the preceding books, someone who has never written creatively before, and someone who thought Rowling's story should include random and unexplained instances of what can only be described as science fiction.

It's as if they not only haven't grown or developed since we last saw them, but have regressed. It isn't due to being presented in ""play"" form; I can read a play and envision the emotions and descriptions that are left out. It's due to the terrible character ""development"" (of which there is very little) and the way in which beloved characters (Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, etc.), who were developed lovingly and extensively over 7 previous books, suddenly act like whiny babies, or broadly comedic fools, or over-sensitive children instead of adults. Professor McGonagall, one of my favorite characters in the ""real"" books, loses her sternness, her sense of fairness, her common sense, and comes off as vacillating and foolish. Dumbledore seems to be suffering from old age dementia, with his bumbling ""advice"" and teariness. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and fully expected to love and cherish this book. Instead I HATED it.

2683,"THIS IS A REVIEW FROM THE CURSED CHILD'S BOOK, NOT THE PLAY!
***I am going to try not to let emotions been taken into account while discussing the work that was given to us; I do not wish to be cruel, disrespecting, and condescending but rather critical, logical, and objective. ***

I wanted nothing more than to love this book, but unfortunately I can not ignore the many inconsistency, cheesiness, and poorly-constructed plot present in it. For that reason I am refusing to accept the entire work as cannon.
I had so many mixed feelings while reading ”Cursed Child,” but only after a few days I could finally figure it out why. The book left me a bit skeptical of how much J.K.Rowling actually contributed to this tale. The third-party story is flawed, something that I am pretty sure could have been averted if the original writer herself had written the story independently.
I just want to start by saying that I was fully aware that this book was basically the scripted format of the play. Therefore, I was already foreseeing, and prepared for, the fast-paced actions, dialogues, and story-development.
I have no doubts that the play must be esthetically superb. The acting is being truly praised by many. The costumes and the sets, even seeing through pictures, could have not been any better. The special effects are constantly being described as “breathtaking” and “mind-blowing.” However, if we take out the visual aids (that in many ways divert our attention) and take in consideration only the story line, we can see numerous plot issues present within the script.
This excerpt from a review blog summarizes exactly how I feel:
“Rowling's lack of creative autonomy in the project means that fans can't be sure which parts of the story were her idea — which is cause for some purists to think of the story as a break away from the book canon. The reason this co-authorship can be such a sticking point is that the plot of ""Cursed Child"" is so outrageous to certain fans that it reads as fan fiction.” - Kim Renfro, from Tech Insider.

The main plot is a mess. A few parts that really have thrown me off were:
1. The lack of showing/mentioning a few key characters (where is Hugo in the Epilogue scene? what about other characters, that apparently not even deserved to be mentioned, such as Ted and Victorie, or any of the other Weasleys, Luna Lovegood…?)
2. Rose Granger-Weasley’s character was so conceited, prejudice, disloyal, and obnoxious towards Scorpius and Albus. I felt like punching her in the face. I think the writers overdone it; if they were channeling for a copy of Hermione from the first book, they might have ended up channeling Draco by mistake. And the fact that Ron Weasley was majorly used as a comic relief makes me puke.
3. The Time turner story line... argh! What can I say? It differs so much from the ""laws"" of time traveling given in the 3rd book. And not only that, apparently a RETCON was made to accommodate the new story line. The new information given by J.K.Rowling at the Pottermore site about Time-Turners, and how she decided to get rid of them once and for all in the series, is nowhere to be found. The “lets go back in the past to save Cedric’s life” was so fanfic like. But not only that…
4. The whole rumor about Scorpius being Voldemort’s son was so ridiculous.
5. The dialogue between the characters were, in so many times, contradictory to their characters, childish, cheesy, and cringe-worthy.
6. Voldemort’s offspring plot was unnecessary and out of this world.
7. The fact that major characters, such as Dumbledore and Snape, were brought back in this play just to reaffirm their redemption was also silly. It already feels very clear that Harry finally accepted their different kind of “love” and respected their actions and behaviors when he named his son Albus Severus.
Even though the script had many issues and it feels/seems like a poorly-constructed fanfiction, is incontrovertible that it had a few of J.K.Rowling inputs implemented into the story. Therefore, using one of the most Sirius Black’s famous quote: “We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on[,]” I decide to analyze my favorite parts instead of only bashing the work.
To name a few of my favorite parts:
1. The whole tension between Rose and Scorpius is very visible, even within the Epilogue, in the 7th book. I would like to think that those two had the whole “Romeo and Juliet thing” going on, with the disparities between their families very visible.
2. The relationship between Scorpius and Albus is also something that could have been foreseen, since it would be a way of creating tension between Albus and his family.
3. The whole house's sorting was also predictable (even though I still had hopes for Rosie to be a Ravenclaw, I believe the way it actually went was more acceptable to validate the issues cited above, and to reaffirm the whole “Albus Severus Potter is an outcast within his own family” plot).
4. Draco's redemption was also pretty much appreciated. The fact that we could seen more about his true personality, and how him and Ginny were a bit jealous of the Golden Trio’s friendship, was somewhat bittersweet.
5. I loved the opportunity to get a glimpse of what the Trio is doing with their professional lives after finishing Hogwarts. Expected a bit more from Ron, though.
6. The turbulent relationship between Harry and Albus Severus is somewhat relatable, and I applaud that. From those people that said that “Harry would never say that,” we all will have this time in our lives that we will say something that we do not really mean it. In Harry’s case, and why not say Albus’ as well, that was it.
7. The almost concretization of a homoaffective couple within the saga! *Even though I am gay, and I would love to see some Scorbus action, I ship Scorose since I've read the Epilogue a few years ago.
There is that.
I am a turmoil of emotions.
I don’t know what I was truly expecting, but certainly it wasn’t that.
They would be better of, with the plot, if the writers of the script have brought back the character of Bellatrix Lestrange (since it was not completely clear if she was killed or not, at the Battle of Hogwarts) seeking for vengeance, or (better than that) just focusing on character development on a “family drama.” Who knows?! I just wasn’t expecting it to be a fall back to the most predictable, yet intriguing and awesome, plots of the series (the time traveling and the Triwizard Tournament).
Reading the script by itself, without any visual aspects to take in consideration, we can see it disclosure tremendous plot issues. And sadly, that make this story seems bit of unnecessary for the hardcore fans.
I still am very conflicted if it all was worth it, but I guess since I could sense that the book had the Rowling's hand on it, I would say it was.
Apart from that, I have loved the chance to, once again, be excited for reading a brand new story about the magical world (even though it didn’t last long).",0,0,0

3323,"I got my copy of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yesterday, and I finished it in a few hours after dinner.  I think it was a pretty good story, but it's definitely a script of a play.  Everyone should know that by now, but judging by what I've read in some negative reviews, some people aren't used to reading plays.  Reading a play is a VERY different experience than reading a novel.  Yes, the story moves fast and there isn't as much depth.  That's because the whole story must be performed in a few hours.  You also have to be willing to put a whole lot of your imagination into reading it.  Thankfully, we're all very familiar with the world of Harry Potter. Also, honestly, we're missing out by not getting to see the staging.  A read play is never going to have the impact of either a well-written novel or a well-performed play. It's one of the reasons so many students struggle to read Shakespeare in English class, but then they go see a play and suddenly ""get"" why he's the greatest playwright in the English language.  Even though most people knew it was a script, I think they didn't really know (or remember from school) how different reading a play is.

Mild spoiler warning!

I also don't get why some people flat out refuse to believe that Harry might be a bad father.  He would want to be a good father, to be sure, but not all good people are good parents.  Especially when you consider that Harry has undergone a ton of trauma and has never really had a father.  One of the compelling things about Harry as a character in the other books was the fact that he was normal: he wasn't super-smart or the best wizard, he was flawed, and he sometimes made bad decisions which had real consequences.  The fact that this same character would grow up to be a man who isn't the best parent or spouse makes complete sense to me.

I get why some people are not thrilled with the Time Turner aspect of the story, but I think it was fun.  They really explored what changing time might do and how that all works.  It was taking one relatively minor plot point from the novels and playing with the idea a little more.  The alternate universes, so to speak, were also interesting to me.

I was so excited about the Cursed Child that I could barely sleep this week. I knew it was a script, I knew Jo didn't write it. But I was excited. Now, I'm bummed.

******I WILL NOW BE SUPER SPOILERY:

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

Things I liked:

-Albus is a Slytherin! Yay!! This was my one wish for this book, along with hoping Scorpius wasn't the antagonist.
-Scorpius. I'm a huge fan of all things Malfoy. Seriously, Draco Malfoy is my favorite character. I'm pleased with how Scorpius was written in the play. The rumor that he is Voldy's son? Brilliant.
-There were times when I could really see the original Ron and Ginny in their characters here. Not often, but occasionally.
-Who wouldn't like to see Snape again?
-I'm glad to see that Harry is struggling with his experiences. Let's face it, with all he's been through, he would definitely have PTSD. The epilogue in Deathly Hallows always struck me as a little too ""shiny happy.""

The disappointments:

-Time moves too quickly, and we get almost superficial glimpses of why both Albus and Scorpius are struggling in school. I would have much preferred for the story to focus more on their experiences at Hogwarts. With Rose as the antagonist with a Malfoy prejudice? That would have been great. Truly great. And unexpected.

-Slytherin. On a deep, gut level, I've needed Albus to be a Slytherin. I've always been troubled by the portrayal of Slytherin House in both the books and the movies. They are the Evil House. Why, WHY would Hogwarts condone the sorting of a quarter of the school into Death Eater training grounds? If Salazar Slytherin was so evil and essentially a racist, why does Hogwarts still have a Slytherin House? And what is the message to the students who are sorted into Slytherin? ""You're evil, kid. Enjoy being a Death Eater!""

Wasn't the takeaway in Books 1-7 that we shouldn't judge Slytherins unfairly? Draco actually saved Harry by not ""recognizing"" him at the Manor. Narcissa saved Harry by being brave enough to lie to Voldemort. Snape is by far the bravest, most extraordinary character in the series. And let's not forget Regulus Black, who knowingly sacrificed his life at a young age in order to destroy ONE Horcux and give others a chance to finish the job. Slytherin more than redeemed itself in the series. And the epilogue reinforces this when Harry tells Albus that it's okay to be in Slytherin. I knew in 2007 that Albus HAD to be a Slytherin. Surely the House system has changed by the time he goes to school? Surely Hogwarts is sorting students on their qualities and recognizing that all four Houses are valid and none are evil? Surely Hogwarts would rather abandon the House system than continue to train dark wizards in Slytherin?

Yes, in The Cursed Child, my dream came true and Albus was sorted into Slytherin. And he became best of friends with Scorpius, just like I had hoped. But there is no redemption for Slytherin to be found. The Slytherin kids continue to be jackasses, even to ""their own."" They bully Albus and Scorpius. We are never for a second shown that Albus possesses Slytherin qualities, nor are we shown that many people can possess the Slytherin traits (cunning, shrewdness, leadership skills) and still be a good person. This play just reinforces the same old Slytherin prejudices. There was an opportunity to redeem Slytherin, and it was lost. Spectacularly.

-Everyone else has said it and I will say it, too: Time-Turners. No. Just...no. There was plenty of material possible without having to revisit the ""greatest hits"" dates of the original series. How convenient that the play ends on October 31, 1981. It's Back to the Future. And not in a good way. I actually groaned when I saw the date. And again, not in a good way. Not to mention that Time-Turners have always been self-fulfilling; they are a closed loop, if you will. We've never seen them change anything. Going back in time always happened. Essentially, when you go back in time, you're only doing what you've ALREADY done. In Azkaban, Harry and Hermione always were there- they didn't change anything. They didn't change time. They just repeated what they had already done. We also have never seen anyone ""go back"" with a Time-Turner. They just catch up with the present.

Are you telling me that there are no other stories to tell? There are- fanfic is full of better ideas that don't involve traveling through time (and don't get me started on the fact that a canon Time-Turner can't travel that far back.) I was hoping this would be a Hogwarts fic, maybe interspersed with Harry dealing with his issues. Maybe even Snape wasn't dead. In canon, we never see a body after the fact, not a grave, or a funeral. A search for Snape would have made my heart so happy. But maybe I read too much fanfic. There are logical ways to make that happen, too. Draught of Living Death, always carrying Nagini's antivenin with him, etc. Or, barring that, what if Snape's portrait was included instead? Albus befriending the portrait at Hogwarts? Portrait Snape as Albus's mentor and advisor? Sign me up.

-Cedric. Where do I start with Cedric? I'll start here: how convoluted is it to imagine that Cedric living would have resulted in Harry's death and Voldy's success? There is no chance that this is where Delphi would have started, prophecy or no. No chance. If I had the ability to travel through time, and I wanted Voldemort to win, I would not start with Cedric Diggory. I would have started with convincing V not to attempt to kill Harry. (I know she gets there eventually, but it's a Plan B.) I would have traveled to another time and killed Harry. Or prevented the destruction of a Horcrux. Or talked V into changing a Horcrux into something less obvious. Or talked him out of taking Nagini to the final battle. Or corrupted Harry into joining V instead. The possibilities are endless. But saving Cedric is not on that list. It's not. It can't be defended. It's a HUGE coincidence that saving Cedric would cause him to become a Death Eater. And logically, Delphi would have not known this or even considered the possibility. The ""prophecy"" was a ridiculous, clearly last-minute addition in order to lend some credibility to going back to the Triwizard Tournament. But we know Cedric. There's not a chance that he would become a Death Eater. He's the most loyal, fair-minded character in the entire series. It's not even slightly believable.

-There's a second Time-Turner? What?? It's like the second launch device in Contact. I know I'm mentioning too much fanfic, but seriously, there are better amateur stories. And better HP time travel stories out there. JK destroyed all the Time-Turners for a reason during Order of the Phoenix. So they wouldn't ex machina the entire story. Are there really no other ideas?? Here's one: Harry being the Master of Death creates some interesting possibilities. I know he destroys the Elder Wand, but maybe he still is the Master of Death as the last owner of the Hallows? Wouldn't that be a better story? Harry discovering he can't die? Or maybe gifted with special powers from Death?

-We come to the worst of all. Voldemort has a child. Voldemort. Has. A. Child. It's hard to write that, because that's ridiculous. It's dumber than what most 12-year-old fanfic authors would come up with. It's rehashing the same old tired storylines, a problem that plagues most sequels. ""But this time, Voldy's a hot chick!"" Not to mention, the logistics of her birth are impossible to believe. This means that Bellatrix was heavily pregnant at Easter, when she tortured Hermione at the Manor. Also, who would have returned to the Manor after the final battle to find a baby? Well, logically, the Malfoys would have. So Draco should know, at the very least. If we insist on this storyline of V's baby, I would have preferred (by a LOT) that Scorpius really was Voldemort's kid. We all knew from the beginning that he wasn't, because we all just knew the story wouldn't have gone that way. What an awesome shock it might be to have Draco produce the second Time-Turner and explain that the rumors are true! And how does Scorpius deal with that? How would his friendship with Albus have progressed? How would Harry feel about his son in any kind of relationship with Voldy's kid? See? It's a more intriguing story than what we were given.

-Lack of complexity. Books 1-7 were brilliantly constructed, with hints of what was to come almost from the beginning. The Cursed Child is not complex. There is no challenge. I love reading to my 7-year-old and exploring those complexities in the first 7 books. It's work for her, but ultimately worth it. TCC is formulaic and lacking the depth and cleverness of the originals. Hermione puts simple riddles on her bookshelf to hide the Time-Turner? Really? That's only one example!

-I know that this next point is the ultimate fanfic reader hang-up. Let's face it: everyone's gay in fanfic. But I believe I know why, or at least why I enjoy it. Fanfic is the best chance to see how little changes might affect a well-known story and well-known characters. What if Harry were sorted into Slytherin? What if Voldemort didn't bring Nagini to the final battle? What if Lily died but James didn't? What if Sirius didn't go after Peter in '81 and had the chance to raise Harry? These sorts of hypothetical situations are the cornerstone of good fanfic. And they are why fanfic exists, to be honest- to see the ripples in the pond that little changes can make. I think this is why everyone is gay in fanfic. It brings up some interesting ideas: If Harry had a crush on Draco, how would that have affected Sixth Year? Or if Harry had been in a relationship with Cedric, how would that have changed the Triwizard Tournament? Would he have personally tried to save Cedric after the fact? Love and relationships are the big, pivotal plot points in most stories on the planet. Changing relationships up helps us see different possibilities in a well-worn story. It's a fun exercise!

I say the above because I want you all to be aware that I am not some fanfic-crazy woman who wants all the characters to be gay. I just like the mental exercise of imagining how little changes affect the entire story. When I heard that the Cursed Child would be about Albus, and then I saw the pictures of Scorpius, I pretty instantly hoped first that they would be friends, and then I wondered how them being more than friends could affect the characters (Harry and Draco can handle being civil, but could they be in-laws?) And I almost got my wish. Scorpius seemed to have deeper feelings. It is expressly written that he has issues with Albus flirting with Delphi. That he was jealous. I know Dumbledore is gay. But come on- they can't be afraid to insinuate that at least a few people in the wizarding world are gay. Statistically, many of them should be. At least leave it ambiguous, like with Dumbledore. Instead, they have to include at the very end that Scorpius likes Rose. Rose, the least interesting character in the whole damn play. And that's saying something.

Final Thoughts:
I suspect that the play itself is spectacular. The acting, the costumes, the sets, the special effects, all of them are most likely breathtaking and divert from the plot issues. But reading just the script exposes all the issues. We have no opportunity to be distracted by the spectacle. That's why I think releasing this was a huge mistake.

I'm worried that this has tainted the first books for me. I don't want to read Goblet of Fire and picture Albus and Scorpius (and Scorpius 2) there during all three tasks. Ultimately, this story adds nothing, only subtracts. There must be literally thousands of stories in the wizarding world to tell. I'm so disappointed that JK signed off on a story that included Time-Turners, events from Books 1-7, and Voldemort 2. It's poorly-constructed fanfic that we now are forced to accept as canon.

I wish this all hadn't happened. I was enjoying picturing what the whole gang was doing now. Now that I know, I wish I didn't know. I'm going to go back to better stories. I'm going to eat my feelings and pretend it didn't end like this.",0,1,0

It's also a play of a series that's been done and finished for many years now, movies and everything, even if the world itself hasn't quite died with Rowlings great charity books and new Magical Beasts movies.

Still, this story is good. It fits Harry Potter, and is fun to read. There's just under 300 pages of actual story and because it's written as a play there's little to know description for any of the characters or settings as you're expected to know what they look like already, and the read is extremely fast. There's enough twists and turns to make this a great page turner and I'm happy to add it as the 8th story to my Harry Potter shelf.

If I had any complaints, it's that the story definitely feels written by a guy who doesn't really know the world or characters well enough and whose name I'll never see anywhere but on this book. A lot of the story uses repeated events to get itself going rather than inventing anything new, and sticks with replaying events already written by the master JK Rowling. As a result it is a rehashing story, but it's done well enough that I'll excuse most of it to call it a great play-book. The ending is also completely tied in an extremely tight package that one would expect from any ""they lived happily ever after"" story, rather than the world-changing events that happened at the end of the 7th book. While this isn't a problem for fantasy tales, I still feel it would have been better had something meaningful been added at the end instead of the two heroes looking out over the sunset. Then again, it isn't my story, and my expectations are always going to be greater than what's delivered.",1,0,1

168,"POTENTIAL MILD SPOILERS

I have been pumped for this ever since it was announced in 2015. I grew up with Harry Potter; I have read the books many times and havd watched the films many times. I own the ultimate editions so that I could have as many bonus features as possible. I recently bought the illustrated edition of the first book and plan on collecting the rest.

So it should come as no shock that my expectations for this story were very high. I read this script in just under 4 hours compared to the 3-4 days it would take me to read the books when they came out. So I had a lot to process quickly. One thing that stood out to me was, despite this taking much less time to read, the play feels epic and a good bit of time passes within it.
 Upon finishing, my feelings were mixed to negative. Some creative decisions were truly puzzling to me. But then I remembered that this is a play, not a novel or even a film. Visualizing this from a theatre perspective, I certainly gained an appreciation/understanding of why this story was told. Upon thinking even more, I want to re-read it and could find myself loving it.

Essentially, this story is about a parent and child learning to understand one another and appreciate one another. This is true for Harry and his son, Albus Severus and Draco and Scorpius (and another character that would be a huge spoiler that I won't mention). The contrasts between the fathers and sons are emphasized, hence why this story feels different from any other Potter story before. Albus Severus and Harry have almost nothing in common except blood. But what few traits they share are what bring them closer by the end.

Other beloved characters pop up. While they seem to behave in ways much different, we have to understand that they are at a different time in their lives and that (once again) this is a play. So certain things are played up for drama or comedy. Aside from the great new characters of Albus and Scorpius, I thought seeing Harry as a middle-aged adult was fascinating. My other favorite character was surprisingly Draco Malfoy.

If I have a criticism, it's that this story sometimes feels like a ""greatest hits"" of thr Harry Potter series. Upon re-thinking, I don't feel that way as much because it focuses on key events from the pass, not every event. It brings the past, present, and future together in a way that makes sense for the characters in this story. In my opinion, it actually does further the story quite a bit. And if Rowling or Jack Thorne ever did decide to continue this story, they certainly could take it to some interesting and different places.

My main issue with the play is not a big one, but it has to do with the villain. I like the villain, and the concept behind the character is interesting and plausible. However, I think an opportunity was squandered to go in a fresher, more inventive direction.

All in all, my opinion on this script has changed for the better. I actually appreciate the story and do consider it canon. There is an It's a Wonderful Life vibe to this story, and many of the creative choices do work, while some are more puzzling. Some plot points would benefit from a full novel or even a film in order to be fleshed out. However, I'm sure that watching the play is absolutely magical for any Harry Potter fan.",0,1,0

Harry Potter is a hero to so many of us and this script just turns him into something else.

HP should have ended with Deathly Hallows. If JK wanted to return to Hogwarts, she should have done so with a whole new cast of characters who have nothing to do with the original characters. I'll go back and read the original 7 books now to try to erase the memory of this from my mind.",0,0,0

I'm sure this is a very entertaining play to watch, but it does not belong in the Harry Potter franchise/universe.
Okay. The biggest problem with Cursed Child is that it wasn't written by Rowling. She can pretend that she had something to do with it, but she didn't, or if she did, she must really no longer care at all what happens to her precious wizarding world. This story had so many major plot holes that would never fly in a HP novel. Part of what makes Harry Potter so special is the amount of details that JK put into it. Nothing in the HP books was an accident, and even today almost 10 years later fans continue to notice amazing details that no other author would take the time to put into a ""children's"" story. Cursed Child reads like fan fiction, and there is nothing wrong with fanfiction, but it pisses me off to no end that Rowling is calling this an official sequel to her otherwise perfect series. This writer was lazy and decided to recycle a cliche story-line while ruining our beloved characters in the process. What is the point?We did not need this story. It gives no new insight to the wizarding world (unlike any of the short stories that were actually written by Rowling, those are great) and it does not tell us anything that we didn't already know about Harry. Spoiler alert (but not really): Harry works at the Ministry of Magic! His relationship with his son isn't perfect! But after useless conflict that only rehashes the past, everyone lives happily ever after! The magic of Rowling's books is not present here, and there are at least 3 major plot holes that ruin the entire integrity of the story. I don't want to actually spoil anything, because I do believe that you should read it for yourself, but this book is a disgrace. What makes me the most angry is that this piece of sh*t was given to us, and then Rowling says ""that's it for Harry! Cursed Child is the end of his story!"" when it should have never been part of his story in the first place.

The plot's a mess of predictable tropes, and the emotional messages--especially revolving around cameo characters--grow trite. But seeing familiar characters and Slytherin house in a new light provides interesting insight, and Scorpius and Albus are the play's saving grace: they're well-characterized and engaging, and their relationship is fantastic--despite the compulsory heterosexuality that looms over what's obviously a romance.

1670,"What is there to say about a novel set 19 years after The Battle of Hogwarts? I'll tell you there are some things to say, and while I shall admit my biases regarding almost anything Harry Potter related, you'll still find I found some things to critique.

As I've said before, the bias I have regarding this book is immense, and I apologise ahead of time!

The Good:
Harry Potter and the characters - need I say more!? This was actually the best part to me about reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child because it gave all of us fans and readers a chance to see an adult Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The most wonderful thing about seeing these characters evolve is that some have changed for the better, and some have stayed the same.
There was no inner dialogue, therefore you are left to your own devices to figure out who the characters really are. Some may actually place this within the 'Bad' things about this book, however I really enjoyed it. It left me to my own devices to judge these characters, and also learn how true they were to themselves through the dialogue itself. If you've read all the Harry Potter novels, than at this stage of the game, not having an inner dialogue doesn't ruin anything because of our own innate knowledge of these characters.

The Bad:
The writing style was not necessarily in line with J.K. Rowling pieces of work. This is minuscule however, because the knowledge of how it was primarily written by the playwrights themselves made it forgivable. It also wasn't detrimental to the entire reading of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I guess for me it was just things that didn't quite fit in the way I read these novels when I've known them since I was young.
This book didn't stick to some historical scenes. For any new readers out there, or individuals not attached to Harry Potter like some fans are, than this small piece is also miniscule. The thing about the scenes that held no 'historical' significance is more or less along the lines of how these scenes were Harry Potter's memories of when he was younger, and in those scenes what was said in the book was slightly different than the play. In regards to the history of some of the events unfolding in the novel when Albus and Scorpius go back in time, it definitely deviated from some of the moments of history - but only in the regards (once again) of what was said. (Not a big deal though!)
Overall, as a heavily biased Harry Potter fan I can't help but to give this new book 4.5 stars out of 5. If I was unbiased based on the above facts, I would most likely rate this closer to a 3.75 or 4... As such though, I still stand by my love for Harry Potter and everything to do with the Wizarding World.",1,1,1

-The number of plot holes is staggering. Worse than almost any fanfic I've ever read.
-All the character building in the original books has been promptly scraped.
-The laziest, and most cliche plot device that exists in media.
-The wasted potential! This is what hurt the most. The more basic and reasonable plot points could have build into such an amazing story.

So Albus and Scorpius become friends on the train and both end up in Slytherin (good stuff in my opinion) Amos Diggory calls on Harry and asks him to go back in time and save Cedric. Harry says no. Albus overhears and decided he and his new friend should embark on this nonsensical quest for someone they don't know to save the other person they heard of maybe once, with no motivation of their own. In short they mess up time in may ways many times to the point where Voldemort had killed Harry in the 2nd Wizard war and Albus doesn't exist. After this being fixed through silly means it turns out that Voldemort had a daughter with Bellatrix and she had orchestrated this elaborate scheme to bring Voldemort back. She tried to confront Voldemort only to find that it is Harry in disguise and they fight, and she actually gets the upper hand on him ( a trained Auror) before, once again, Harry has to be saved by his friends. Anyways they beat her and imprison her.

3792,"This book, if you can call it that, is unreadable. I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series, both books and movies. I wouldn't classify myself as a fanatic, I can't recite lines or remember the names of each spell but I have always thoroughly enjoyed the series. The first seven books were so well written, Rowling took you on a journey and you felt everything she described. She portrayed each character, big roll or small roll, with all the same detail. You hated Potter's cousin and you could just picture what he looked like each time he spoke.
Fast forward to this book, upon seeing this I was super excited. I pre-ordered on Amazon and counted down the weeks until it arrived. I had already expected a play format (was not enthused) and understood that most likely Rowling did not write much or any of this book but was excited nonetheless. First day, I downloaded the book and started reading and it was completely unreadable. It felt like a poorly written fan fiction, now I don't know if it's because the author or because it's a script. I understand that as it's adapted from a play, the audience can visually see the characters and don't need it described to them. If that's the case, then this book is just a lazy way to make $$$$$$$$$$.
Thorne barely described the characters and I had no idea what Potter's boy looked like. Each character sounded like they were pouting and complaining without any real plot.

3266,"First of all I want to say that this is a SCRIPT not a novel. A script is still a story but it requires some imagination. In addition, scripts also come in book form. Anyone who is complaining that they can't believe it is a script needs to remember that is the way it was always going to be.

I am a hardcore fan. Have the books, have the audio books and just this year I went to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios. Now, I did not have a hard time reading it. I loved the character development and the real struggle between Harry and Albus. I always imagined that to be a child of Harry Potter would be immensely difficult. As an angsty teen, Albus displayed more realistic emotions and I love that he is the opposite of his father. I also find that the main characters from the original series developed EXACTLY as they should.

Many of the complaints on here say that you can't recognize Harry or the other characters. To that I have to ask: what adult in their 30's or 40's can say they are the same as their 17 year old selves? Harry is a father, that comes with a whole new set of challenges that can't be magicked away or solved with a quick conversation. The development between Draco and Harry is the way things should be, when you are older you don't always hold the same grudges.

To sum up: the script will read like a script and yes reading nothing but dialogue can be difficult. But keep in mind that if you know the originals as well as you think, creating imagery in your head shouldn't be hard. Remember that these characters have changed in 19 years and should be looked at as they are now. It's a great read and don't discount it. Now to the spoilers.

Spoiler!!!!!!!!

Of course Hermione would be minister of magic, she was always destined to be that powerful. Ron is still Ron with his fun loving goofy spirit who is steadfastly loyal. Ginny has grown wise and not so much the meek Harry Potter worshipper she once was.

I can see how Harry would have a kid in Slytherin and that they would be best friends with Draco's son.

While some feel that the plot with Voldemorts daughter is far fetched; I implore everyone to rethink the relationship with Bellatrix and Voldemort.

To sum up again: the script will read like a script and yes reading nothing but dialogue can be difficult. But keep in mind that if you know the originals as well as you think, creating imagery in your head shouldn't be hard. Remember that these characters have changed in 19 years and should be looked at as they are now. It's a great read and don't discount it.",1,1,1

This book butchered the original series so badly, I tried to re-read the book just to give it a more detailed review on how much I hated this book, and I had to stop not even halfway through because I had so many negative thoughts about it that it would've been bad for my mental health to continue.

In fact, this book never should have existed, I think that part of the reason the book was so bad was that they were scrambling for a villain. The Deathly Hallows ended with the words ""All was well."" If they really wanted to give us more content, they should've wrote a Marauder's prequel, and by they I mean J.K.

1926,"Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, is now a grown man with children of his own who are now attending Hogwarts.  Harry's childhood was not easy and it appears that his son Albus is following in his footsteps.  Albus is sorted into an unexpected house at Hogwarts and his best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's longtime enemy Draco.  Albus has long struggled with being the son of the famous Harry Potter, but this time his struggles will put him - and those closest to him - in very real danger.

I admit that I had mixed feelings about buying “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, knowing it was a play and not a book, and - while was based on her ideas - it was not written by J.K. Rowling.  After reading it, I still have mixed feelings.  To be sure, the story is a good one with Albus struggling in his father's footsteps just as Harry struggles to be a good father (as he says at one point he did not have any good examples to follow growing up).  Albus's friendship with Scorpius is well done - I never thought I would like a character whose last name is Malfoy but Scorpius is delightful - in fact, I think he is the real star of the play.  Besides the expected Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, many old favorites appear in this play (some briefly) and there are some poignant and scary moments.  But in the end, this is a play not a book and lacks some of the character development that was in the books. Albus and Harry's relationship is realistically done but I would have liked to have seen more of James and how Albus gets along with him.  Classroom action is pretty much nonexistent in the play.  I found that the play, which is split into two part and is meant to be seen on two separate nights, is overlong (so much dialogue for the actors to learn, especially the young ones!) and feels like it could have used some editing (perhaps with some of the alternate worlds in the play).  I was never bored while reading the play; it just seemed a long play to be sitting in the audience watching.  Having said that, I would certainly go see the play just to see how they pulled off some of the magic - I bet it is awesome to see in person!

4389,"Huge Harry Potter nerd here. Simply seeing a piece of artwork involving Harry Potter can send me into tears. Met my husband in a Harry Potter chatroom. Have read all the books MULTIPLE times each, etc etc. I am a HUGE fan.

J.K. Rowling has disappointed me a couple of times since the last book came out (mostly when she said Hermione and Ron should not have ended up together), but I will say this is the single biggest disappointment. I know she didn't write it - but the fact that she endorses it, and that I am to take it as canon, is frankly sickening.

Time for me to get spoiler-y:

***********SPOILERS***********

The characters were SO OUT OF CHARACTER. I could believe Harry having struggles with fatherhood due to the fact that his was dead. However, telling Albus he wished he wasn't his son? No. Never. Those words would not come out of Harry's mouth, not matter how provoked. Rose being prejudiced towards Scorpius? ROSE WEASLEY, the spawn of Ron and Hermione? They would have taught her to NEVER judge based on house, I feel that she would never behave like that, shunning her own cousin just because he wanted to be friends with Scorpius. You're trying to tell me Draco Malfoy would be okay with his son befriending a Potter, and would have taught his son as much, but Hermione/Ron did not pass this along to Rose? Hermione was not her normal witty self, Ron did at least have some humorous moments - but Harry was just so off. Shunning family for work, telling Albus he couldn't be friends with Scorpius, his BEST FRIEND. That is something Harry would NEVER do. He knows the importance of friendship more than anyone! That is practically the whole point of the books. I just don't believe it.

Don't get me started on Voldemort having a daughter... He was never the type to be interested in procreating. I guess I could look over this, maybe he wanted to pass on his name, WHATEVER, but the fact that she is just kept hidden for years, and reemerges as Amos Diggory's nurse... why wasn't Harry's scar hurting the whole time? Why did he just now start to feel her presence? Why on earth would she choose to save Cedric in order to save Voldemort?! There are so many other ways she could have done that, much CLEANER ways, that perhaps wouldn't spawn a million different alternate timelines. And the time turner.. not even freaking canon, although I guess now I am supposed to consider it canon - going back in time as much as you want apparently, not to mention all of the things that doing that would change, and the fact that some people even had problems with how the third book handled messing with time. WHY CHOOSE THAT AS A PLOT? It's so hard to believe even when done properly. There are INFINITE other possibilities (as many other, BETTER fan fictions have explored). They could have done such great things with the story of Harry's kids. Instead they did this.

And Cedric becoming a death eater? Because he got humiliated at the triwizard tournament? HAS THE AUTHOR EVEN READ HARRY POTTER? Cedric was a purely GOOD human being, he would NEVER go to the dark side, especially over something so trivial. I don't even know if Cedric had the ability to feel humiliation, he was so confident in himself and his abilities. The fact that the entire plot of the book rests on him becoming a death eater like that is so ridiculous, it makes me sick to my stomach. He would've made a joke out of it and moved on, he didn't care if he won the tournament. I cannot believe this book was allowed to exist.

There were a very few select moments that I did enjoy. The flash of Hagrid as he picked Harry up out from Godric's Hollow (but, then again, anything involving Hagrid makes me melt). The fact that Albus was sorted into Slytherin was great, and the fact that Scorpius had a crush on Rose was great as well. Hermione being Minister of magic has long been my head canon. I admit I did shed some tears when Harry watched his parent's die, but only because that's a sad moment from the actual books. I don't like that he was there to witness it, along with all his friends and Draco. He saw it in his dreams, that should've been enough. There were some funny moments, mostly from Ron or Scorpius, but other than that, I really find nothing redeemable.

So, so disappointed.",0,0,0

2328,"Since the advent of Kindle, I've rarely bought paper books any more. Digital books are easier to store and a lot of time they're cheaper too.
When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I thought about getting a hard copy...I love the Harry Potter series and what better way to celebrate the new story than to buy a book that I can display on my shelf? But old habits die hard and I got the ebook instead.
Halfway through the Cursed Child, I became terrified that Rowling would release a new edition of the Deathly Hallows (my favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite books ever). Being a Star Wars fan as well as a Harry Potter fan, I'm well aware of the tendency to change the older, more beloved stories to fit the ""new stuff"" instead of taking care to make sure the new stuff doesn't contradict the real story--and I don't want my Deathly Hallows changed, thank you very much. It's Harry and not Ginny who tells Albus that ""He likes a laugh, your brother"". I know kindle periodically sends out updates to books and what if one day I accidentally hit a button and my Deathly Hallows gets ""updated""? What if Harry isn't a good father in my epilogue anymore?
Having worked myself up into a complete panic, I hurried to Amazon and bought myself a paper copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There. Now the story will always end like it's supposed to: Harry's a great dad and his scar doesn't hurt. You'll have to break into my house and vandalize my beloved book before that changes.

In the interest of fairness, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Scorpious Malfoy and had the play followed his schooldays' adventures with Albus Potter, I would have willingly purchased a paper copy of that story...instead of whatever it was the play actually was. It wasn't just that I didn't like how much it changed things and characters, the script just really didn't hold my attention.

* The book is written in script format, since it was based off a play, which is kind of annoying, but once you get used to it it's just as good as reading a normal book.
* Some bits of the story, like the Trolley Witch, seem a bit ridiculous (but isn't the whole Harry Potter series that way?)
* Rose Granger-Weasley and James Sirius Potter are barely in it, and Teddy Lupin isn't in it AT ALL.

But overall it's great <3 It's really cool to read about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco (unfortunately, Neville and Luna aren't in it) in the future and it was also really cool to learn more about their kids (especially Scorpius)

We are used to filling in the scenery and fleshing out the ""text.""  The script is good and tight.  It really moves, twists and turns, carrying the tension in the rhythm of the dialogue.

A play is not a novel.  There are no details beyond where actors stand and what they say.  The reader must be able to recreate the pictures in the mind, in this case, from all the preceding novels.  The play runs 5 hours, about as long as it took my husband to read it aloud.  It was gripping.  Had this been one of the Potter novels, it would have run into three books!  Plays are concentrated story telling, like frozen orange juice.  The reader must add the water to the proper dilution without learning all about oranges.

No, the improbable dialogue wasn't what turned me off. It was that this new story lacked innovation. Lacked magic. Lacked Hagrid. Cliché in both characters and plot development. Albus Potter was a thoughtless misguided Harry. Scorpio Malfoy was a totally-not-endearing Ron. This was just bad. I mean, read it because it's the new Harry Potter. But that's it.

Ok, let's start with what I liked. I liked another Harry Potter story. Period. It was a joy to read because, well, it's Harry Potter. I'd swim the Copacabana beaches to get a HP story (my dig at Rio...).

 Second, I am a huge sucker for Butterfly Effect storylines. They intrigue me (one of the reasons I like the Star Trek Kelvin Timeline so much). It is interesting to see what a fixed point in time is like in the Harry Potter world. Cedric must die. Cedric’s death rocked me. It was so quick and so final. There was no pleading or begging. There was no reason other than he wasn’t supposed to be there. Kill the spare. Avada Kedava. Dead. Cedric was an innocent in the whole bloody mess and his death, no matter how tragic, had to happen. And that’s the true tragedy. The lesson is sometimes the dead need to stay dead. In a way, his death was one of the reasons the Riddle was defeated. The script is clear on that, but I have reservations about how it came about (more below). Still, it brings about a painful moment in Harry's life. The reason he can see the Thestrals.

I liked Harry witnessing the death of his parents and doing nothing about it. He understands. I think he always did and messing with a timeline doesn't change that. It wasn't something he didn't already know. He didn't have an ""aha!"" moment in this story. The scene itself was a very touching and a heartbreaking moment in Harry's life. And he was able to share it with Albus. Too bad he doesn't see Snape sneak in. That would have made me cry. Him too I suspect.

But I'm afraid I have far too many negatives.

First, it lacked depth. I know this is a play and you need to see the actors. I'm sure the scripts from the movies looked hollow as well. But this was, well, totally hollow. There was very little character development of the three new characters and what development there was was squeezed from really a common cliched plot: parent and child don't understand each other, child does something stupid, parents still loves child, parent and child reunite to fix the stupid, parent and child love each other. Yawn.

I could tell it was written by someone else. It lacked all of Rowling’s elegance. Because it is a script does not matter at all. Rowling writes incredible dialogue which in many cases was transferred directly to the movie. When the characters speak to one another it felt chucky and forced. The scene in which Albus (as Ron with the polyjuice potion) tells his aunt he wants to have more babies and kisses her was pretty terrible. The dialogue was horrible and, well, ew.

The established characters were flat and did not act as themselves in any of their incarnations. (Harry, Hermione, and Ron specifically). I didn't expect much growth from our heroes because, well, they're adults and, sorry to say, once adults get into a rut they tend to stay there. That doesn't mean they can't break free with magnificent results, but, well, most of the time they don't. Ron was nothing more than comic relief. While he added the comic relief several times during the HP books and movies (""Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?""), Ron's character served MANY important purposes as, and this is not an exhausted list, a link to a new family for Harry, being his foil in many ways, and showing the darker side of friendship (jealousy specifically). Hermione was simply not a clever girl. Really, Minister? An illegal time-turner hidden in a place even our bumbling heroes could find it? Harry was also a problem. He was not Harry. He had none of his gentle compassion and understanding. I know, I know, he’s a bored Ministry worker. I know, I know, he was traumatized from Riddle. But not really if you take into account the final scene in the movie and the book. Harry was beautiful with Albus. Albus was unsure and Harry was kind, compassionate, and loving. There was no hint that there was any strife between them. At all. And the movie establishes a very happy Albus getting on that train. While movie and book are different, Rowling has always supported the films as her visions and never, so far as I know, disagreed with how her characters and the action is interpreted. And I don’t think it’s a matter of not wanting to tank her own movies. I think she really does support everything. So…an unhappy Albus doesn’t make much sense. It’s simply a plot device used to create a weak plot.

To that end there are several plot points that just don’t jive. I have no doubt Riddle could have, and possibly did, father a child. I have no doubt he and Bella got it on. But come on, people. Bella pregnant? No. If he was to have a child it should have been an unknown. A rape would have even been better and more consistent with Riddle's personality. An angry, violated mother that was capable to turning out a child just like Riddle himself through years of being hated for being alive, the cycle of abuse well established for a third round. Also any child of Tom and Bella would have been much, MUCH older than Scorpius and Albus, not what appears to simply be an older girl. She'd be older than Harry. We never see Bella pregnant since she got out of Azkaban with Tom's return meaning any child had to happen over about 15 years before Order of the Phoenix.

Now, as much as I like Cedric as a fixed point in time, I don’t think being humiliated at the Tri-wizard Tournament was enough to make anyone become a Death Eater. It was one time. What about consistent humiliation over a period of years? Not even then. Look at Neville. My god, Harry for the first 11 years of his life! The whole point of Harry Potter is that it is what that is inside that determines who you are, not what is done to you. I consider Cedric to be a literary ideal character, like Samwise or Faramir. Cedric as a Death Eater is about as consistent as Samwise stabbing Frodo to get the Ring. Nuh uh.Nope.

Finally, the number of old characters seems forced. One of my only gripes with X-Men movies is when they try to force too many mutants into a movie. The result is the inability to develop new mutants or continue to develop old mutants. It becomes a distraction. While I was thrilled to see Snape again, I don’t think he was used well or efficiently. It was one of the better “cameos” but given the attempted to focus the story on the boys, it was hollow as well. Yes. He still loved Lily. Yes he’s still loyal to the Order. Yes, he dies. Again. But his death is almost a shadow of what it was in the proper timeline. Dementor’s Kiss is bad, but being killed by Riddle knowing what we now know is heroic and the only way Snape should die. I think his Cursed Child death almost diminishes him in the alternate timeline. I also take issue with Dumbledore crying his eyes out. No. Just no. That is not who Dumbledore is and that is not how I want Dumbledore presented. It’s just wrong.

So there you have it. No real need to argue any points with me. I enjoyed it for what it was, but called it out for what it wasn’t. I have high hopes for Fantastic Beasts because I believe this will take us back to the proper presentation of Rowling’s world (since she wrote it). This seemed a lazy effort in a world so complex and interwoven world wherein zero plot holes have ever existed. Until now.",0,1,1

I was friends with her husband first and throughout the years of knowing him he has sold me inch by inch more pieces of his sphincter and color starting from his anus. These were transactions that usually included me feeding him delicious home cooked meals or treating him to a ""Man Date."" I am a Straight Man but we've played this game where we try to catch each other off guard and do things like cop a feel, grab butt, or even do Kancho (see definition below).  After he met his wife she's tried to be his shield. Why I am telling this story?  After gifting his wife this as a Christmas Present she said to him that she cannot protect him any more because I gave her the Best Present Ever.

Long story short: This can make wives stop protecting their husbands from being molested or violated.

I had not realized at first this would be in screen play format, which is really annoying and difficult to read-my fault for not paying attention to that. I had to force myself to get through it.The plot is weak and has holes, too many questions left unanswered, the story was rushed, and the characters actions were out of character (primarily Harry.)

(SPOILER WARNING): Harry Potter doesn't seem like himself and neither do Ron or Hermione. It's like the characters we know and love are gone and have been replaced by impostors. Regardless of all this, I still love Harry Potter and always will. Everytime I read the original books I am transported through time and space to a wonderful and magical place.

4187,"I'm a life-long HP fan who works as a theater designer and I read plays regularly. I came into this book with low expectations as it wasn't actually written by Rowling.  I was afraid it would be too much like a fanfic and pandering to a nostalgic rabid audience instead of developing a strong story.  Unfortunately, my instincts were right on the money.

This book is a shameless money-grab with cardboard cutout characters and an overwrought plot reminiscent of a telenovela.  The dialogue is lackluster and completely unbelievable.  Fan-favorite characters appear in the story more as a roll-call than to add anything of value..  To put it succinctly, it's a hot mess.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are completely unrecognizable.  Specifically, Ron is written as a buffoon who literally points his wand backwards at one point in the story. He has no real role or idea of what's going on.  Harry has regressed into the shouty ball of angst from Order of the Phoenix.  His words and actions are completely out of character.  Hermione basically just nods in agreement and spends her time shooting ""withering"" looks at Ron.  Yikes. Draco is in here too, also reduced to stilted dialogue with no personality. The second generation kids have completely unbelievable dialogue and spend more time professing their friendship love than the average Lifetime movie.  Everyone's dialogue is practically interchangeable, all nuance between character's speech patterns is completely abandoned.

*SPOILERS*

This plot seemed like a writing prompt and a chance to try writing all the favorite characters in the series, living or dead.  I'm shocked that Sirius didn't get dragged into this mess.  My personal (not) favorite was the universe in which Hermione morphs into Snape and openly bullies students. WHAT?! The Time Turner plot was riddled with plot holes and systematically dissembled a decade of world-building with it's underdevelopment.  Also the big reveal about Voldemort's daughter makes zero sense.  The book takes the time to show us the butterfly effect when time meddling through Albus and Scorpius' bungled attempts. Are we supposed to believe that a child of Bellatrix and Voldemort being born while rewriting time would have no ramifications on the present day?

I could write an essay on the failures of this book.  The real mystery is why Rowling would sign off on such a horrific product.  It's not like she is lacking in money, prestige, or power.  I haven't seen the play but I can only assume that the fantastical special effects must be doing a great deal to mask this weakness in this book.  Reading it in book form strips away the glamour to the bones of the story which, unfortunately, leave a lot to be desired. To be a well-crafted script, you must follow the same rules as a well-crafted book.

Don't let nostalgia cloud your judgement. This book does not belong on the shelf next to Deathly Hallows.",0,0,0

I thought it was a good story, interesting characters, and old friends, and JK Rowling themes.  I had a problem with how Ron was portrayed ...sort of a ridiculous...and not as bright as the Ron we know in in the first 7 books. I highly recommend Potter fans try this play with an open mind.

28,"I bought this book when it first came out, but then never read it because of the mixed (bad) reviews. Maybe it was because I came in with such low expectations or maybe it was just because it's a great story, but I loved it. Yes, it's different from the original books. It's more character and dialogue driven, it is a script afterall, and because it's a script we miss out on some of the details that help really bring a story to life.  Also, it's a little more mature, Harry and the gang are forty now and some of the jokes kids won't relate to. But I don't think this story is really for children. Many of us grew up with Harry Potter, but now we're adults. This book deals heavily in relationships, mainly between fathers and sons and I think it did a great job. I know that many people were mad with how Harry acts towards Albus, but if there is one thing this book teaches us is learning that those you love aren't perfect. Though this book differs from the first seven it still has the components that made those seven great; adventure, heart and friendship. Also guys, it has time travel. Let me repeat, time- butterfly effect- travel. Which helps to tie it back into the world of the first seven books. The while time I was readibg it I thought; I can't wait to see how they do this on stage.",1,1,1

That, coupled with the weak plot, plus JK Rowling not actually writing the entire story leaves this as a failure. I am a huge fan of the original books, I've been to Hastings launch parties, I re-read them at minimum once a year. I will not be including this in future re-reads. The fact that they feel they can charge $15 for something that isn't even a proper book is absolute madness.

737,"I am a Harry Potter fan. Not a die-hard fan like some people are, but I've always loved to read, talk about and analyze the Harry Potter books. Seeing that I would never likely make it to London to watch this much-anticipated play, I decided to spend the 15 dollars and at least read the script. My impression was that this play would be really fun to watch, with dimensions brought alive by the acting, stage tech, props, etc.
However, the script itself seemed very amateur. There were parts that almost made it, but overall, it felt as though I was reading a fan-fiction. The character and plot development were weak. I understand that this is a script for a play so it could lack the complexities we found in the novels. However, the characters seemed two-dimensional or out of character. The things they did or said were either too predictable or too outlandish. Basically, I found this world of magic unbelievable and shallow.

The plot was not entirely predictable, but it was definitely not original. It felt like a (spoiler here?) mash-up between Harry Potter and Back to the Future 2. The theme was obvious, but could've been delivered in a more masterful, creative way than was presented in this script.

All to say, this script will fall short for Harry Potter fans who love the books for the intricate plots, attention to detail, and complex character developments. Because this script lacks all of that. As I said in the title, it may be great to watch the play unfold on stage, but it certainly wasn't as exciting to read on paper.",0,0,0

It’s an insult to the intelligence of fans who have spent years reading and rereading the HP series. A couple of dudes who knew nothing about HP wrote this and screwed it up royally. I get the vibe that these two guys didn’t even bother to read the HP series...for example, if they did, they’d understand how the Fidelius Charm would work at the Potter’s home and how because James and Lily were hiding Harry, they weren’t able to leave the house (Lily mentions this in a letter the find she once wrote to Sirius in DH). Yet, here...the two dudes have James and Lily out pushing Harry in a pram. Major contradiction to the original story.

1181,Being a Harry Potter fan so very disappointed in the format. So much of the old material merged into a play. I missed the characters development. I think the cursed child  is barely worth the read. I have come to expect excellence in a J.K Rowling book and this book was so much less than her first book.

4802,"First major problem: it's a therapy novel. (Except it's a play.) It's not action, it's not ""showing"" instead of ""telling,"" it's ridiculous quantities of self-reflective psychologist couch language between all the characters, including between the teenagers, and all of it utterly unconvincing.
Second major problem: the characters are either caricatures of their former selves extended into the future, or have no personality at all. Like Ginny. She's a total blank. Ron is a fool. Scorpius came closest to having a personality, but he kept talking in therapist-chair sentences (see First major problem, above).
Third major problem: Stupid story line. I figured out ages ago that J. K. Rowling engineered the destruction of all the Time-Turners at the end of HP5 precisely in order to avoid getting stuck in the endless tedium of time travel stories. There are contradictions in this one, like all time travel stories, but ultimately what made it so irritating is that it was just a way to re-engineer the old drama of Voldemort. Seriously?

Voldemort with a daughter? I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that one. It's way worse than trying to imagine your parents having sex, to be truthful.
And making Harry watch his parents murder? Nope. Would the real Harry Potter have been able to calmly watch that? I think it would have been a lot better for them to leave as Voldemort was going up the walk. I think we all would have been happier.

As a Harry Potter fan, but also as an actor and director of stage plays, I was thoroughly entertained by this script.  I know a lot of HP fans are upset that this isn't a novelization of the play, but I was delighted.  I enjoy reading plays, and finding new materials to perform and direct.  When this play is available for amateur productions, it will be on my list.

I actually found the time-turner aspect of the story a lot of fun.  Yes, the HP world has shown us before that time travel is a closed loop... but we also only saw that from a few hours point of view in the third book... this one plays the time travel aspect going back 20 some odd years... and even 40 years at one point.  It's the same premise that was used in the Back to the Future series.  When what is supposed to happen doesn't happen, what are the consequences?  You end up with alternate time-lines, and until the loop is closed and the things that were supposed to happen actually happen, everything will be slightly off from what you knew before.  When it first happens in our play, the world as our young heroes (and make no mistake, the true stars of this story are Harry's son Albus, and his best friend Draco's son Scorpious) is different.  Not a lot different, but enough to have wiped out one family they knew... Showing that when even small, subtle things don't happen like they were supposed to, changes are made for both good, and ill.  Their second trip back in time tries to undo some of the damage done by the first trip, and still complete what they believe is their mission... but this one goes even worse than the first trip back.  It's an upside world, and, as an actor, I find that a brilliant challenge to play.  How do you take a character so well known, and turn them upside down so the core of who they are is the same, but their experiences are different, and subsequently the choices they made.

I look forward to seeing the stage show when it comes to the US... and eventually look forward to tackling this story as an actor/ director.",1,1,1

What a disappointment.

As J.K. Rowling did not write the book, the characters in the play feel like strangers. The tone of the book is just...off. The plot-line is weird, and doesn't follow along with the logic and rules established in the series.

Personally, I think this book reads like fan-fiction - but BAD fan-fiction, to say the least. I spent my teenage years on sites like MuggleNet, and I have definitely read some good Harry Potter fan-fiction in the past.

It's the story, the story is absolutely vapid, and were it not for its title it would have been discarded among the throng of shameful attempts at engaging storytelling. The plot is centered around time travel, quite possibly the most cringeworthy storyline cliché imaginable and completely passes over the essence of the series in the first place. Throughout the first few acts the reader is constantly being jerked around in a half-assed attempt to catch them up to speed, and the sparse snapshots of life that we are shown do little to rival the sentiment of merely watching an episode of Full House. I'm thoroughly convinced that anybody who rushes to the defense of this book is so intransigently entrenched in fandom that they couldn't work past the guilt of having grown up with Harry Potter to even consider slandering this abomination to an incredible series.

When I read that J.K. Rowling had assisted in this, I was truly excited, thinking that I'd once again be taken back to this wonderful world. I envisioned reliving childhood experiences of losing myself in Hogwarts, imagining that I was there with all these characters that I hold close to my heart.

Unfortunately, this book takes all the magic away. The way these loveable characters are portrayed in quite the opposite: Harry is a disillusioned and angry man, Ginny is God knows what, Hermione's intelligence and wit are gone, and Ron's a backdrop, with no lines with substance, just to name a few.

Along with all the timeline errors, and mistakes in the stories, none of these characters' personalities are the same as the previous books. The storyline itself feels inaccurate, rushed, and not thought out at all.

3004,"(no spoilers)

I avoided spoilers before reading this play, but went in having heard the storyline was absurd and that seeing the play was worth it for the effects and staging. I didn't have very high expectations going in, and I already knew the facts: it was a play that wasn't actually written by J.K. Rowling and it was most certainly not going to be Harry Potter #8.

That being said, I was quite frustrated when I finished reading. It took me less than 2 hours to read through this, and with each new twist I became increasingly confused as to how JKR could've approved this story. The characters have the same names as the ones in the HP series, and some of the magic is the same, but the play is completely inconsistent with canon. The characters seem like different people in many cases, and usually the version in the play is worse. For example, Ron is a worse version of movie-Ron. Things that were carefully detailed in the books are thrown away for gimmicks. Many aspects of the story come off as badly-executed fan service.

Maybe seeing the play would make this more tolerable, but the story itself isn't what you'd expect for the HP universe. If you feel like you should read the story out of completeness as an HP fan (which is why I bought the book), I'd recommend trying to borrow it from the library (or at least not paying full price for the hardcover edition).",0,0,0

The problem isn't that it's a script instead of a novel. The problem isn't that we aren't seeing the visuals when we read it by itself.

HEY SPOILERS ARE COMING. DON'T READ PAST THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT THINGS SPOILED.

Things that really bothered me:

- Time turners. Awful, just awful. We didn't need those back. They were weak in the 3rd book, so I was glad they were destroyed. It's like they focused on the joke people make where ""since they had time turners, why didn't they just get rid of Voldemort as a child"" or other similar stuff, and turned it into a big part of this story. Plus time travel is always super messy. Especially when they had three timelines going on by the end.

- Voldemort having a child. HA. This whole story had me rolling my eyes, but that was just the worst and most ridiculous part for me. He wouldn't want a child and he wouldn't have wanted to sleep with anyone. He didn't care for anyone but himself, that was already made quite clear.

- So many people were missing. Where was George, Teddy, Hugo (Ron and Hermione's son), Neville, Luna, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, plus Lily, Rose, and James are barley in it. I'm sure there are more that are missing.

- None of them felt like the characters that we know and love. Ron is more of an idiot. I don't like him all that much in the other books, but I can tolerate him. What little roles he has in this is dumb. Especially that he was drunk at their wedding? There's no way. Hermione seemed dumbed down and simplified. If she had something as important as the last surviving time turner, she would've hidden it better, not to mention it probably wouldn't be in her office. And Harry. Everything about him seemed wrong. I know that he's going to be different than we last saw him, but this Harry seems like a different person. I hate what he said to Albus. I don't believe he ever would actually say that to his son. Oh and you know who else was different? The woman who pushes the trolley with treats on the Hogwarts Express. That whole scene was ridiculous.

- They brought back Cedric just to drag him through the mud! What was the point? Also, he wouldn't have become a death eater just from the events they made up.

- Why make Harry watch his parents die? That's just cruel!

- Also, it's very jumpy. It's annoying how fast they breeze through the first 3 years for Albus at school. That would've been the most interesting thing to read about in my opinion.

The whole thing about Voldemort having a child I thought was crazy but once you get over that fact the person they pick is really cool. I thought that Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy(Draco's son) were gay, they hugged all the time but they covered it up with Scorpius liking Rose(Hermione and Ron's daughter) and Albus liking Voldemort's child.(I can't say the name that would be too much of a spoiler alert.) I didn't think it was hard reading it as a play script. It had none of the luster as the past 7.

It was also disappointing to see Hermoine, Ron and Ginny diluted to caricatures of their more nuanced characters.

1782,"(While my Goodreads rating currently sits at 2/5 ""okay"" I don't feel it deserves 3/5 so I'm giving it the same amount of stars here)

I am thinking.

Where to begin?

Hmm... ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" is the script to a play based on a story by J.K. Rowling. It begins during the epilogue of Book 7 so the gang is now all grown up and ready to pass the torch to the next generation. Therefore, while the old gang is featured throughout the play, the story focuses more around Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, Harry and Draco's kids, respectively.

Let's get something out of the way first. I don't particularly mind this being a script to a play rather than a book. Would I prefer a book? Sure, absolutely, but my preference is usually the conversations between characters anyway. In that respect, I wasn't looking for lush descriptions of our surroundings or of how the characters are feeling, etc. My imagination and memory of this world will suffice.

Having said that, it doesn't bode well when only minutes into the script I find myself taking down notes instead of enjoying the story (something I've never done with any of the Harry Potter books). This is something that happened constantly throughout the earlier chapters of Cursed Child and I could hardly stop myself. Characters were acting in ways that made no sense, sometimes being spiteful just because to the point of they being downright unlikable. In short, they weren't acting like human beings should act, age notwithstanding. The source of the problem, as far as I can tell, is time.

Simply put, we don't know any of these characters, not even Harry, Ron, Hermione, et al. I mean, it's been almost twenty years since the Battle of Hogwarts and a lot has happened since then. The epilogue at the end of Book 7 works, for the most part, because it's short, and the characters appear to act as we remember them to. However, in Cursed Child we spend more time with them, and the more I read the less I connected with these characters. To further compound the problem, the events in Cursed Child develop over four (if I recall correctly) years but in the span of 300 pages (about the same length as Azkaban), whereas Harry had 1 book for each year. Consequently we're given glimpses into the lives of these characters and, in order to reinforce them, the script plays the ""tell, don't show"" card to an untenable degree, almost as if someone were shouting, ""DO YOU GET IT NOW?!""

I do get it, Cursed Child doesn't have enough room to breathe life into its characters and it suffers for it. It tries to redeem itself a bit as we approach the final acts but most of the damage has already been done by that point.

It's time I addressed the plot. Personally, I found it to be pretty absurd, unfortunately bordering (if not outright crossing into) fanfiction territory, a bad to average one. Very early on a character says something that made me think, ""This can be easily verified in our world. Wait, this character should know that!!!"" The catalyst that prompts Albus' and Scorpius' adventure is... I don't know, that somebody wrote it that way I suppose. A prophecy is put into play, a laughable one. A character is introduced, again, straight out of someone's fanfic I guess. The only thing remotely engaging about the plot is that it explores the question of ""what if?"" to varying degrees of success, placing familiar characters in unfamiliar circumstances. Unfortunately though, it is also one of its weaknesses as it really does come across as a remix of (some) of Harry Potter's greatest hits, as others have suggested. To top it all, the story's more engaging when it only features half of the dynamic duo (I'll let you guess which one. Hint: his name starts with Scorpius).

If the story had continued the way it started, I would've given it a 1/5 without a shadow of a doubt. However, it is salvaged by the fact that the characters start resembling human beings later on (though I still feel they dropped the ball here) and that the Malfoys, Scorpius in particular, do their best to slap some sense into the rest of the cast and get this story back on track. Thus, my rating stands at a 2-ish/5, it was okay-ish (barely scraping that 2). I fail to understand why this story even needed to be told.

Fortunately, I had the good sense of buying it on Kindle because, to be honest, I don't know if I want the hardcover standing next to my Harry Potter books. That privilege needs to be earned and ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" has failed to earn it.

3130,"The Harry Potter series of books (the seven ones in the main series and the three ""Hogwarts Library"" complimentary ones) are popular for a good reason.  They're not your ""flavor of the week"" fad and they're trend setters rather than followers. They're timeless, engaging, well written mystery novels that are far more interesting and smarter than the movie adaptations make them look (not that the movies are BAD, quite the opposite, but people who are only familiar with the series through them are certainly missing a lot).

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, referred to as ""the eight story"" is none of that.  It's certainly not a book, since it's a play, so what we have here is a rehearsing script.  Now that's fine.  It's understandable, expected and I have no problem with it.  The problem is everything else.  Unlike the books, this story is derivative, predictable, self-indulgent and dumb.  It has many of the characters seen in the original books, but they're there in name only, since their personalities are certainly not the same.  Also long gone?  The smart writing, the nail-biting mystery, the sense of adventure and anything close to actual life-lessons, replaced with childish attempts that border on humorless parody.  This story is fanfiction, and it falls into its most notable pits, doing no effort to avoid them.

Let me give you an example.  Picture you and your significant other are shopping and you say: ""Hey, we should buy milk"", so she/he replies ""We can't do that, we have no milk!"".  Spot the lapse in logic there?  How you offer a solution to a problem and the other person replies by simply stating the problem which you're giving a solution to?  Note how preposterous that is, and how dumb it would be if you just accepted it?  Let me show you the example on the book:

Two guys and a girl are about to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time.  One of the guys proposes an idea:
GUY: ""... we're going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel back afterwards... maybe we should just - try going back an hour first, say, first and then...""
GIRL: ""I'm sorry, GUY, we have no time to waste.""

No time?  NO TIME?  You have a freaking Time-Turner RIGHT. THERE.  Time is what you have THE MOST of.  More than anyone else.  Heck, the entire idea he was giving you was to MAKE TIME.  Your response makes no sense!  And the fact that neither of the guys point it out is even worse.

Now this might sound like nitpicking, but this particular bit of dialogue showcases the main problem with this strictly plot-driven story: logic is set aside because the plot demands things happen.  Characters will go against their personalities because the plot demands things happen.  This is just one of the many aforementioned pits of fanfiction.  Here's a short list of others:

- The Mary Sue: this is a character that has no flaws, can't fail and always has the right thing to say to solve a situation.
- The Obvious Villain: this is the character that you will easily peg as the villain the moment they show up even though the story treats it like an unexpected twist when it's revealed.  A telling sign is that they're too eager to make the plot advance.
- The Derivative Callback: what's a writer to do when he wants to evoke the same feelings from a work someone else started without having any idea how to write well?  Simple, he just writes scenes that are similar to ones created by the original writer in hopes that the memories of the previous ones will be enough to give readers the same feeling.  In this particular case, this gets too on the nose when two guys and a girl use Polyjuice Potion to sneak into the Ministry of Magic to steal a trinket.  I wish I was kidding.
- The Manufactured Drama: this one's obvious.  Drama has to happen, so while two characters could talk like normal people instead they choose to either stay silent or break character just for it to occur, because the writer has no idea how to bring it naturally.
- The Forced Pathos: a writer wants the reader to feel sad, but he can't write compelling drama, so what does he do? Simple, he repeats sad scenes that the previous writer created.  The difference with The Derivative Callback is that these aren't just similar, they're literally the same scenes, step by step, shown either by flashback or time travel.
- The Superpowerful villain: a writer wants the stakes to feel higher, so what's he to do when he can't write compelling characters or situations?  Well, he gives the villain incredible powers, of course, whether these make sense in the story or not.  ""Oh, you thought the previous villain was powerful?  No, here's version 3.0, that old geezer has nothing on MY guy!  What's that?  That there's no precedent for this kind of power in this universe?  Blah, I don't understand those words, look at the fireworks!""
- The Ship: Sigh.  I, of course, mean ""ship"" not as a vessel, but as a verb, as in ""I'm going to pair these two characters together wheter it makes literally no sense or... wait, ESPECIALLY if it makes literally no sense"".  This is probably the most known one in fanfiction (so much that it has its own subcategory, called slash fiction), but it's especially painful here.  Once you read who's certain person's father you'll know instantly who the writer decided would be the mother, even though, again, it makes literally no sense.

Please understand that I gave this story a fair chance.  I was actually very excited for it, I preordered this book back in February.  I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, but I also knew she's not the only good writer in the world, so I gave this what I thought was a well-deserved opportunity.  Instead, I was ""rewarded"" with having to read what appears to be some blogger's Harry Potter, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life's fanfictions all rolled-up into one.

Make no mistake, this is amateur writing at its worst.  I have nothing against fanfiction.  I've read some very, very good Harry Potter fanfiction in the past, but for the life of me I can't believe writing this poor ever got such a chance.  I absolutely don't recommend it, but if you HAVE to read it, then go prepared.  Adjust your expectations as low as possible and you might draw some enjoyment out of it.

Naturally, I and the world and his dog rushed to pick up a copy.  Here are my thoughts.  I should point out that I have not seen the play, worse luck, and am going from the script alone.  Note that there will be total and complete spoilers, which I will hide after the cut.

First, the non spoilery section. There was a lot I loved about it, and some things that didn’t work nearly so well for me.  I loved that the same themes that pervaded the book series – love, friendship, family, loyalty – still form the core of Cursed Child.  It was wonderful seeing how Harry, Ron and Hermione coped with adult life and parenthood (being an adult myself, it was especially fascinating.). The new characters, Scorpius and Albus and their friendship are completely adorable – Scorpius really does get all the best lines.  And, naturally, it is simply wonderful to revisit the Wizarding World in any shape or form.  Rowling’s world is utterly breathtaking.  I really wish I could see how certain scenes played out on stage.

What I didn’t enjoy so much were certain plot points.  I didn’t feel they gelled too well with what we know about the Wizarding World and the characters in it.  Some character development points I didn’t feel worked too well in a play setting.  They might have worked better for me in novel format with more space to expand and develop them.  Also, while it’s not necessary to have devoured Pottermore, certain interactions do have much more meaning if you are aware of some of the character’s backstories.

All in all I enjoyed Cursed Child and gave it four stars out of five.",1,1,1

1819,"Sorry, but no.  Wish I could return it and forget it.  I knew it was play format which is not pleasant and lossses a lot of the ""meat"" of the story but I was ready for that.  I was not ready for Harry to act so immaturely and lets face it, vindictive. That is not who he has ever been.  Hermione & Ron felt like filler, not the characters we love.  I wish JK Rowlings would just go back to this world and write full novels which are true to the characters personalities and heart.

Spoilers:
Like the Albus Scorpius friendship.  Voldemort had a child?  I always  read him as completely non sexual, like he would consider such things beneath him.  Also, he would not share a part of himself with someone else ( his DNA). I am having a hard time wrapping my head around him having a child",0,0,0

There were so many bad decisions that went into making this it's hard to believe the person who wrote the finely crafted interlocking world of the original books was involved in any way.
First, why on earth would you issue the final episode in the form of a play? People keep saying ""well it's probably better on stage"". Well, the fan base is an ardent worldwide group of novel readers. Choosing to only show the true version of the story to ONE room of people in one place at a time was a just a poor choice. Everyone else gets cold and frankly ridiculous sounding stage directions instead of pages of rich description from one of the greatest writers of the century.

Second, and much more importantly, this story line is so bad it's actually gut-wrenching. As a huge long time potter it was so hard and painful to read. I don't usually like being critical or snobbish about movies or books. I try to enjoy them for what they are and not dissect them 100 different ways. That being said this script was so full of plot holes and inconsistencies it's actually hard to believe JK ever read it. Books can and will be written about the problems with this story line. It is completely incompatible with the world the original 1~7 books established. I would provide examples but don't have it in me to open the book again. The motives and actions of many of the characters make absolutely no sense at all. The decisions of both the protagonists and the main villain are so absurd and illogical that the only explanation is plot convenience to take the audience to revisit an old story.
It's so frustrating to see an almost perfect series, something which will live on as a classic; tarnished by what is essentially a polished turd.",0,0,0

I wish wish wish I could see it..... What a blast from the past! While I do feel this book felt a bit 'fan fictiony,' I actually really enjoyed it. I was open to not enjoying it and willing to give it a bad review if needed - I am always truthful and honest with my ratings on books. But - luckily I loved it:

The book takes place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and we follow Albus Potter, Harry's son, who is struggling to live up to the Potter name. There's a lot of conflicts in his life, from a hard relationship with his dad to his pretty grim Hogwarts experience - and so when something happens that means he could change the past and inevitably the future, he grasps the opportunity only to ROYALLY f*!k things up.

I am someone that never rereads a book. That said, I hadn't been swept into the Harry Potter world since I was a kid and I was really nervous that this book would ruin a major part of my childhood. Yes, I was one of those complete nerds who would be standing outside of the bookstore at midnight dressed as a witch, waiting for the release of the next book in the series..... don't judge me.

I'd tried my best to keep away from everyone else's opinions until I'd read it but some people had told me they were really disappointed - I still tried to go in with an open mind though. With that in mind, I really don't understand why people were disappointed in this book! I found it captivating, page-turning and thoroughly gripping. OK, the writing wasn't earth-shatteringly good but it's written in the form of a script and I think they did a damn good job at making it as good as it could be.

I enjoyed being reminded of certain things that happened in the original Harry Potter books that I'd long since forgotten about. I enjoyed catching up with the characters too (although I can never really remember Ron being quite so classically humorous.. I always thought of him as quite ingeniously sarcastic and dry rather than 'trying' to be funny). I am still not sure what I think about Draco's character, he changed the most out of everyone to me - a lot of character development which is always a good thing, but I liked him as the bad boy. Just my opinion.

The plot wasn't as mind-boggling as the original books, it was short and quick and had a direction all of its own and there is nothing wrong with that. You can never beat the original HP books - but I definitely think this book is worth a read nonetheless.",1,1,1

When finally getting to read the play, I was very positively surprised. I enjoyed that the storyline focuses on just a few characters, as we know it from the other books where Harry, Ron and Hermione used to be the main characters. To me it seemed better this way, instead of trying to give uptdates about each and every characters live (I do realise some characters like Hugo or George are completely left out of the storyline or only touched upon quickly - however, it used to be the same in the books, with for example Hermiones parents only appearing very little. Now other characters are in the main focus, and some we used to ""know"" better in the books aren't as much talked upon. I don't see this as something negative).

The play seems like an actual new story, while at the same time tying in nicely many questions left open within the 7 books. I had to read it a second time directly after having read it for the first time, and was left with a very content feeling. It seems to confirm things that had happened throughout the books taking away any possible doubts about why something had to happen the way it did happen in the book series.

1817,"While I will read anything Rowling gives us, I have to wonder how much involvement she actually had in the script. The script mostly reads like the second Back to the Future movie...which we all know stunk. Instead of delving into how the Wizarding world has changed since Voldemort's reign ended, we're stuck back in the past, inside a book and story that have already been written.

Spoilers!!

Most of the characters fall flat and our only way to perceive they actually care for each other is because they tell us over and over again how much they care for each other. Seriously, Albus and Scorpius have more emotional hugs than one person can stand. And they don't even end up together. The narrative leads us to believe there might be a romance brewing only to throw in traditional gender norms back in our faces at the end. I don't care how her characters identify, but be consistent!

My fiancé was joking about how Rowling might create a villain worse that Voldemort. ""Maybe Voldemort has a brother?"" he laughed. So, so close, so, so cliche.

To sum it up, Rowling is a master of invention and creativity incarnate: I have no idea why she approved this self-serving work of fan-fiction. Really, she should either write us a new book or stop messing with the series entirely.",0,0,0

One thing you should understand is that this is a script to a play and not a proper novel, so don't go in expecting it to be anything like the other books in the series, it's meant to be experienced as a play (for example the book details where characters will appear on the stage and things like that.), and just reading it isn't giving you the full experience.
I see many people complaining about the characters and story, apparently expecting the content of a full novel from something that is only a script to a play with a very limited amount of time in it, so the story goes VERY quickly, going from plot point to plot point to plot point as you would expect in a theater production.

1404,"Reads badly like a story in a monthly magazine written for subscribers. I feel they disrespected the Potter fans worldwide and am returning this book pronto.
Found glaring plotholes(IMO) and like another reviewer said, the characters do not stay true to their own values from the original series.
Really bad fanfic! Not at all worth the hype and the fact that there is a ""Definitive script"" also being released later at some point shows that the publishers and whoever else is making even a single penny off this book have published it for the money.
Should not say this is the ""Eighth story, 19 years later"" and tarnish the memories and expectations of the readers. Especially when JKR keeps blowing her trumpet saying that her Potter writing is done fully and finally, but still keeps churning content regularly!
Personally, I would like to say to JKR that she should have waited to publish this work and ironed out all the discrepancies and issues first instead of what seems to be a very rushed and improperly vetted publication.
Not even worth 10$ and they are selling it for 18$ on Amazon to make that fast buck before everyone catches onto the absolute rubbish that this book is.
I don't mind it being a play OR a script but even as either it seems terrible with magical beings making muggle references in dialogue amongst other terrible nuisances this book creates.
JKR, it's OK to not put out more HP stuff, we can live with what's already out there but please don't ruin it for everyone by giving your blessing to such ditchwater writing. Sorry John Tiffany and Jack Throne, maybe your own creative characters would have had more justice done than for you both to have used the names of the favourites of millions worldwide and disappointing them such.",0,0,0

246,"Having read scripts in the past I can still see the story through it.
That being said I now regret not being able to see the actual play, And how the action and special effects are managed.
Since this is not a written book you cannot see how the characters are portrayed  in such great dimension, this would be provided by the actors on stage.  This being said here are my opinions.
First of all there are two protagonist groups Harry's and his son and best friend.
With regard to Albus, not enough of his life before Hogwarts is discussed, so how he turns out prior to the beginning of the script is only insinuated in later scenes. Thus, while Harry had a few points in his favor before he spoke a word in the first book, Albus starts in the negative and goes lower before proceeding to redemption.  This is mirrored in Harry's path through this story as well.
Whereas books 1-7 had fully developed scenes from daily life with hints at later chapters at the beginning, this story had snippets.  Only when the main arc begins does the story feel fleshed out.
The main arc involves the use of a magical artifact introduced in book 3, and it's results read like a episode of Dr. Who, but allow it's protagonists to mature.
The culminating scenes, while full, were less satisfying than prior books(eg. The chamber and Riddle, Sirius' escape, the graveyard, etc).
The antagonist seemed to be a macguffin destined to mimic the Potter men's issue instead of a true villain.

While it seems I'm being very negative and my review I must now explain why I gave it four stars.  The story reads like a play that was based on a movie that was based on a book.  If you are a potter fan you can fill in most of the blanks and see the wizard world we fell in love with.",1,1,1
