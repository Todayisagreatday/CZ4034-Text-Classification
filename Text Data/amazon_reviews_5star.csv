Loved It!","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2016","** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reconnects with Harry Potter and the gang as they navigate adulthood, raise families and try to suppress a past that doesn't want to stay put.

There wasn't much that I disliked about this novel, except for maybe the fact that it was pretty short and a quick read due to the fact that it was written as a play script.

Otherwise, absolutely entertaining to read if you enjoyed the original series that J.K. Rowling produced. I loved that readers got a chance to continue on yet another adventure with Harry Potter and his friends, as well as watch their children experience some of their own adventures. Like father, like son.

Although Draco Malfoy was pretty much a prick throughout the original series, he actually shows that he's a human being with feelings in this latest novel. And, that his son is nothing like the monster Draco was in school. Little Scorpius ""King Scorpion"" is a wonderfully optimistic kid that seems to find the light in even the most morbid darkness even as he battles rumors of being a descendant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!!

In comparison, it was interesting to see how one of Harry Potter's children, Albus Severus Potter, seems to harbor a pessimistic, distant attitude having to live in the shadow of his father. While Harry may have pulled out ahead in his battles with Voldy, he demonstrated that he has a LOT to learn about parenthood ... thankfully, Ginny seems to have a good handle on it.

While I have heard varying critiques of the book being offered as a script, it's still a thrilling adventure that the reader gets to embark on. Yes, you don't get as serious detail with the script but if you are familiar with the previous books/movies, or have any amount of imagination that won't stop you from thoroughly enjoying this latest installment in the Harry Potter Series.

Worthwhile read for anybody seeking an escape from reality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was pleasantly surprised. Your three teenagers (how we left them) grew up & were living adult lives with problems. Albus Severus was a middle child & Scorpio was an only child. Both weren't popular & they were drawn together. I don't want to say a lot because of spoilers but trust was misplaced & they were curious. Wanting to do something good for another person but being boys, you can hurt or get hurt not knowing what you are doing. Albus was the middle child, he would never be anything special to his parents & he could never live up to his Dad's legacy. He reminded me of Harry when Draco told him there were people to hang out with and ones to stay away from. He stood up to Draco & made clear Ron was good enough for him. Albus did the same on the train to Hogwarts. He joined Scorpio in an empty train compartment (Scorpio was alone). Albus' cousin Rose told him they needed to sit elsewhere, basically Scorpio was not a person to sit by and especially be friends with. Albus stood up for Scorpio. After that, Rose, his own cousin severed all ties with Albus. When Harry was young, he idolized his dead father. Albus resented his living father and wished he wasn't his son. I could go on but read this book through the eyes of Albus & Scorpio & what transpired. When parents don't keep open dialogues with their children & tell them how they should feel instead of listening to them, bad things can and will happen in our real world and even in Harry Potter's world. Read it from this point of view and you may really enjoy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I pre-ordered this book a few weeks before its release date and held on to it for the past few weeks until the hype died down. I read very few reviews for this book, knowing only a few basic facts before I went into it. I didn’t even read the synopsis when I ordered it on Amazon because I didn’t want to risk any spoilers.

Luckily, the synopsis didn’t give away the story. I’ve read some mixed reviews about this book, and I can honestly say that the hardcore Harry Potter fans will have issues with how time travel is handled. I went into this as a new adventure, happy to have another Harry Potter story. That’s it. I didn’t analyze every book in the series or make too many comparisons because I wanted to enjoy this story as if it were the lost novel J.K. Rowling stashed away in some drawer. I don’t care about the loopholes or the inconsistencies or the fact certain characters are missing from the story. Okay, I care a little bit, but I did not let it disrupt my enjoyment of this book.

If you’re expecting this book to be a continuation of Harry Potter, you will be disappointed. But if you’re like me and you’re thrilled just to get another glimpse into this world, then you’ll probably rave over it. Another thing to consider is that this is a play adapted to a script book. With plays, the time is limited, and they had to cram a fair amount of information into a short time frame. There are almost always some minor inconsistencies in plays. It’s just how it is and it’s something I’ve come to accept after over twenty years of going to the theater. If you’ve never seen a live production and you’re expecting a full length book with all the questions answered, again you will be disappointed.
What I Love About This Book…

  I forgot how much I missed Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. I think I missed Ron most of all. I loved him from the second I read about him in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. He’s such a goofball and it was really nice to see him again. He had a few lines that made me laugh and go aww, Ron, I love you.

  Harry is still Harry just older and sort of grouchy. Even though the books were about Harry, I was more of a fan of the secondary characters. My opinion didn’t change after reading this book, and I was glad the focus of this book is on Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.

  I really like the dynamic between Albus and Scorpius. From the start, everyone is hating on Scorpius and he was my favorite character from this book. Each scene with him only made me like him more. He could’ve chosen to be the bad guy at certain parts but the underlying story, just like the original books, comes down to friendship. That’s what I always liked about this series and that part remained intact.

  We get to see Snape again!!! I forgot how much I missed him, too. He was down to help the kiddies and I loved that he was willing to take one for the team once more.

  We see a little bit of Dumbledore, and there’s a really cute exchange between Harry and him where they discuss their relationship. Harry is very annoying in this book, which is why I was glad he wasn’t the focus. But I liked how his conversation with Dumbledore’s painting helped him to see what was wrong in his relationship with Albus. They constantly butt heads because they think they’re so different but it’s because they’re so much alike.

  My favorite book in the series is Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, and for that reason, I was really happy with the plot of this book. I loved being able to revisit parts of my favorite book with the help of a Time-Turner. And without going into detail, that also means you get to see some of the characters from back then, which was really exciting.

  I have always liked Draco Malfoy, and I guess if I had to choose a house I would’ve been sorted into Slytherin. I never gave much thought to this, mostly because I always thought with my personality this would make sense. I love characters like Snape and Draco. Who cares what house they’re in, right? That’s my thinking.

  I also liked the development of Harry and Draco’s characters as family men, and even though they’re not going to hug it out and have a sleepover, I did like that they had come to sort of understanding by the end of the book. There’s a secret about Draco that humanizes him a bit by the end, which I think had a lot to do with Harry’s change of heart.

The Parts That Made My Heart Hurt…

  Although Hagrid was not a character in this book, we did see him through Harry’s dreams. For me, Hagrid was the reason I was sucked into the first book in the series. Well, that and the fact the Dursleys were child abusers and I was so angry about it that I kept reading to make sure Harry got away from them. Sorry for the short rant but I really hate the Dursleys. Anyway, hands-down Hagrid is one of my favorite characters in any book. There is a serious tear-jerker moment where we get to see the past, and when Hagrid sees baby Harry, oh my God, my heart melted. It reminded me why I love Hagrid so much. He’s such a sweetie. I just wanted to hug him.

  There are a few scenes at Godric’s Hollow, and if you’ve read the books, you’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to get into the specifics, but my heart literally hurt for Harry. I was hating on him most of the book until this one particular moment.

  Harry and Albus’ relationship was painful at times, but I was really happy with their overall character development. Some of the exchanges between them made it feel like they were strangers and not father and son. It was sort of depressing to see Albus feel somewhat like Harry did as a kid when he had a father right there. I thought it made sense to some extent, considering Harry did not grow up with a father. It was also very sad to read about.

There wasn’t much I disliked about the book, which is why I gave it 5 Stars on Goodreads. I think I was just too excited to have another Harry Potter book that I was willing to overlook some minor issues with things that J.K. Rowling attempted to fix throughout the series, only for them to reappear in this book. Just writing this review made me miss it even more so I decided to start watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I own all the movies through Amazon, so I couldn’t resist throwing it on just so I could see some of my favorite characters on-screen. And now I need to do a reread of this series, most likely some time closer to winter.

I really tried to limit this review to character development, and I didn’t give any spoilers, not unless you count who made a reappearance, even though I didn’t mention all of them, but other than that, I didn’t reveal any of the plot. You’re in for hopefully a pleasant surprise if you haven’t read the book yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_62?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=62&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm guessing that those readers have had little exposure to scripts and aren't accustomed to visualizing stage action.  I found the limited stage direction delightful, as it allowed me to imagine the creative use of the set, lights, and stage as I interpret.

Another complaint I've heard is that Harry's actions are out of character. I didn't find that to be the case at all. We are seeing Harry the father for the first time since accompanying young Albus to King's Crossing during the epilogue of The Deathly Hallows. Although a grown man with a child of his own now, Harry is as clumsy with fatherhood as he was with his relationships as a boy... something I believe all parents can relate to at times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I didn't go into the book thinking that it would be.  In my opinion, when something is written in a script format, it is up to the actors, the make up artists, the special effects folks, etc. to give it that extra edge and you do not get that from reading this script or any script.  If it had that much detail, it would be a novel and not a script.

While enjoyable, the concept of this story has been done before -- it's basically Harry Potter meets Back to the Future or Butterfly Effect.  I liked both of those movies so that suited me just fine.  The plot focuses on two main themes - an unlikely bond between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy and the ongoing conflict between overbearing-dad Harry and bratty-teen Albus.  I wish there was more of Ron Weasley but I guess we can't have everything.  In addition to seeing how the characters from the novels turn out as adults, we get to meet their children and enjoy some cameos from characters who are supposed to be dead.  There is lots of homage paid to the original series, much the way Star Wars Episode VII paid homage to Episodes 4-6 -- I personally enjoyed all the nods in this play to the novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some have criticisms that are not valid. I have found the story to be very interesting. The characters are true to their portrayals in the previous books. This book is a script, so the author cannot tell us what the characters are thinking as in her books. Some have criticized this. A script is a bit different than a book and the reader must realize this. Still, the author did an excellent job of portraying the characters without the benefit of giving us their thoughts. The only thing that bothered me is we are never told why Ron is managing the joke shop and no mention is made of George, the one who owned the joke shop. Is he no longer around; the readers are never told?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is (technically) the 8th book in the famous Harry Potter series by J K Rowling. It takes place 17 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and in fact, picks up right where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ends. It details a particular adventure had by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy (sons of Harry and Draco respectively). The use a time turner to try and right what they perceive to be a terrible wrong via a trial and error method that results in a world that has no Harry Potter and where Lord Voldemort rules. As with all the Harry Potter stories, this one deals with relationships - namely the one between Albus and Scorpius as well as the relationship between each boy and his father. Yes, imagine that! A play that features characters who have daddy issues. Gee, that hasn't been done before - like 782,423 times. It's a minor quibble I have with the story, but at least it was done well if somewhat predictably. The only other quibble I have is that the Albus's first two years at Hogwarts are summarily glossed over. I don't understand why that was necessary. It doesn't enlighten the journey of any of the characters or figure into the plot. I did like that the reader gets insight into Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and his understanding of Lord Voldemort. Harry even comes to understand why fate had to roll the way it did in his life. I'd always wondered if he'd ever come to terms with that. Those who know me might wonder if I had any problem with the whole time travel theme. I didn't, but that's only because this is the Potterverse we're talking about here and in the Potterverse, all you have to do imagine something for it to be possible. Now, if you want to know what the consequences of trying to establish a Potterverse in this universe are, I highly recommend reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Time travel and its physical as well as philosophical implications are actually addressed there. I found the last third of this book impossible to put down. The story, although slow at first, builds into a very suspenseful tale that is worth your invested time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is probably going to sound silly, but I decided before reading it that i was going to treat it as something separate from the original seven books - almost as though all of the characters were brand new characters who just happened to have the same names as the original Harry Potter characters.  This helped me to enjoy the book a lot more, because I could just enjoy it for the quick action, rather than comparing it to how I envisioned the future of Harry and his peers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","Based on the other reviews, I was very hesitant to read the book and opened it, already thinking negatively about it.  I stopped and reminded myself that 1) I didn't expect it to be written by J.K. Rowling; 2) I didn't expect it to be like the other books, or a continuation of the other books; 3) I didn't expect anything in relation to who or how the characters would be.  After all, the last time we saw them they were what 18?  Now they're nearing 40, married, parents, holding jobs that their own parents held/would have held.

I picked up the book again and started over with no expectations.  It was fun to read.  I loved the references to the other stories, seeing Aunt Petunia in just a slightly different light, Draco actually loving someone, Harry stumbling through life as he always does, getting lucky here and there, having a great support system in his friends.

It's all there.  Everything we always loved is there, it's just different now.  As, maybe, it should be.  The ending had me in tears.  Probably the last 20 or so pages had me on the verge of tears.  A lot of growing up on those pages, and a lot of love for the series sprinkled throughout this book.  I think it was respectful of the original, and allowed us to say ""Hello"" again to some characters we love, and remember the painful ""Goodbye"" we had to say to a few.

I feel that the people giving it 1 star did so with the thinking that this should have been another Harry Potter book.  It was more than that.  It was a tribute to J.K. Rowling's work, and lovely homage to the characters she brought into our lives and homes for so many years.

Happy reading!  Don't expect it to be something it isn't, and you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm really puzzled by all the negative reviews written about this great sequel to the Harry Potter series.  Many reviewers seem to feel that the play differs so much from the books themselves that J.K.Rowlings could not have really been very involved in its writing.  I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE!  The story itself is wonderful and Rowling's involvment couldn't be more obvious.

I'll admit that initially I was a little disappointed by the fact that this story is presented as a script and not the usual novel format.  I'm not a great fan of reading scripts.  But within about 2 minutes I completely forgot about that aspect because the story is good...it pulls readers in...and the format itself is done so well that it doesn't detract from the story in any way.

Before I wrote my review I read many of the existing ones and did some research of my own to answer a few basic questions.  One of my top questions was 'how and why was Jack Thorne selected as the writer?'  I learned that he's a relatively young playwrighter and screenwriter who has already built up an amazing reputation.  The Guardian writes that ""He's quickly establishing himself as one of Britain's most sought-after writers.""  The Guardian maintains that his talent is unusual because ""he's equally prolific in both theatre and TV.""  And also that there's no doubt that ""Thorne will achieve the first instance of a play text becoming a runaway No 1 bestseller. ""

More importantly, Rowlings herself was the main reason Jack Thorne was chosen as the writer...her involvement in the selection and writing process is very easy to document via Google.  The last shred of evidence is included in her dedication at the beginning of the play manuscript.  Rowling's Dedication to Jack Thorne reads ""To Jack Thorne who entered my world and did beautiful things there. —J.K. Rowling""

I also discovered that Jack became a first-time father while working on ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.""  His own Dedication, also in the beginning is to his newborn son Elliot Thorne who was born on April 7, 2016.  It was something I missed when I first read the play and I think knowing that adds an a personal element that's sweet.

Without revealing too much of the plot line, I think that this story does a remarkable job of continuing on from where ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" left off in the epilogue.  It answers questions about how Harry and his friend's families grew and evolved overtime as well as how he and his friends developed personally and in their careers. It's a compelling story exactly because everyone isn't how you might have envisioned them to be later in life.  It mirrors real life so well in this regard.  What our intended courses were versus what the real courses our lives have taken are oftentimes very different from each other.  It's puzzling to me why those that criticize the play don't understand this.

In reading the positive reviews I was struck by how many people wrote that they wished this story were longer...because I felt the same way.  Although it ended and closed well...I didn't want it to end.  And I do agree with some of the criticisms that mentioned there are too many characters who are left out of the story entirely...and who I'd like to hear more about as well.  But overall, I think this story was perhaps one of my favorites because it did a great job of not overemphasizing the negative 'dark' plot lines that can scare younger readers (or play attendees.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After reading the script book for the new play I felt in some ways of going to a family reunion. It was wonderful to see what my favorite Witches and Wizards have been doing over the last 19 years since the last book.

Harry’s son Albus Severus Potter and Draco Malfoy’s son Scorpius have become friends and are brought into an adventure. The chemistry between the two characters is as touching and family feeling as is Harry and Ron. I enjoyed the story that has father and son issues and helps the characters see and heal each other’s pains.

Unlike other Harry Potter book covers that have a meaning to the story. The logo of a boy in what appears to be a snitch made out of a bird nest is somewhat confusing to me. However, after reading the story I believe Albus Potter is the cursed child.

I enjoyed this story after such a long time of missing Harry and the gang. So now I’m even more excited for the new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was nervous about this story.  One of the things I loved so much about the original Harry Potter series was Rowling's writing style.  She has this way of completely enclosing the reader in the world of witches and wizards.  And as much as I love plays, I just wasn't sure if this would match up.

I want to just state for the record -- I was pleasantly surprised.

The new characters have been taken straight from Rowling's mind.  Thorne did a wonderful job of making Albus, Scorpius, and the new set of Hogwarts witches and wizards the same as Rowling would have, had this been a novel.  For me, that was a huge relief.  It made it so much easier to get sucked into the story.

The storyline was also classic Rowling.  It was a moral story (don't mess with time!) and a story about relationships between fathers and sons (and daughters).  But it wasn't overtly obvious or preachy.  It was just a good story.

I'm not going to make this review very long because if you're a Harry Potter fan, you've already read this or added it to your TBR list.

Enough so that I read it in two days, sorta didn't want to put it down. That being said, I really wish Rowling would actually make a new book series based on the kids, like this book was but start from the beginning of 1st year at Hogwarts and go until the end like she did with Harry, Ron, Herimone, and the rest. This story kind jumps quick quick quick through several years and ends.

Once I got used to the new format, this felt like a seamless continuation of the original series. I enjoyed it very much.

The characters are multidimensional and well-developed. Old friends from the previous books are brought in and out in a natural way, complete with the ""baggage"" of having lived and changed over twenty years, while the new, younger characters carry the plot line.

My biggest complaint is that I didn't want it to end.

Comments: I'll keep this spoiler-free as much as I can, but I can't believe anyone has actually waited to read this book! Awesome book! If you're expecting a typical Harry Potter read, though, this may not be for you. Just know that it is in script form. It will get your imagination working a little differently. It's a great visit with some beloved characters from the original series, but it's also an introduction to some new, lovable characters as well. Really interesting to see Harry and his contemporaries as adults, too. If you're into the whole concept of time travel, you have to read this book!
Pre-ordered and hoped it would arrive by release date, but it took Amazon a week past that to get it to me, so the waiting was the hardest part!
Here's what happened when I read:
1. I wanted to read the series again and go back to Hogwarts with Harry and the gang.
2. I got terrible cravings for Butterbeer at a certain Florida theme park.
3. I wanted to fly to London to see it on stage (but didn't).
4. For the first time ever, there were moments when I (gasp!) hated Harry Potter the character.
5. Enjoyed imagining how this would be staged and all the special effects that must be used.

Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Please if you are a Harry Potter fan disregard all of the negative reviews.  And here's why:

Many of the reviewers have failed to realize that this is a story about the relation between Harry and one of his sons.  More to the point it captures what it is like living in the shadow of a famous hero.  Giving the title of the screen play I think that that should be understood.

You will also see the development of some of the original cast, but again the story isn't about the original cast it's a whole new story line with a new set of characters.

If you are looking for the original cast go back and read the old books.  This is for those who expect to see a difference in characters because no one is the same after 19 years.  With that said don't expect Harry to be the same boy he was who killed Voldemort.  Don't expect Malfoy to be the same egotistical boy who hated muggles.

With that said I hope everyone who loves the Harry Potter books as much as I do give this book a chance because it is good and truly unique.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thoroughly enjoyed it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","I have just finished reading the script and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a script of the play so don't expect the detail you have come to love from the Harry Potter books. The characters, scenes and dialogue cannot be the same as the books, because this a script.  I enjoyed the story line, the cast of characters and the action. The limitation of the script format didn't detract my pleasure of the story.  I thought the characters were very well written.  In particular I enjoyed the portrayal of Scorpius Malfoy, who was very likeable, and I found Albus Potter rather irritating, not because of poor character development but because he was written that way.  Those who gave negative reviews were expecting more of the same from the previous books.  Instead of expecting the same, just appreciate this for what it is: a script of the play.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_90?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=90&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I understand why some people are disappointed though; you don’t get to see the actors and there isn’t all the exposition and internal dialogue that you get in a book. However, if you’ve read the books once, twice, three times...then you understand the characters and I don’t think the screenplay takes you outside those parameters. One review I read didn’t like how Dumbledore was portrayed. I disagree, the man was full of regrets and whatever was left of him in the portrait was done with interfering. I loved seeing Snape out from under all the pressure but still delightfully snarky. Give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My love for ALL things Harry Potter runs deep.  This is in my opinion HANDS DOWN the GREATEST series ever written.  The thought of being able to dive back into this world made me so, so happy.  I have had the book for a while and have been dying to get to it, but other things got in the way.  Now that I am done, I just want to open it up and read it again.

I cannot even count anymore how many times I have listened to The Harry Potter Series, or read it, or watched the movies.  It is too many to count.  Every time I get like a giddy little school girl again, because they make me that excited and happy.

Anyhow, lets get on to the review.

This is a script of the play that is now playing in England where I wish I was right now watching it.  We get to go on a ride with Harry's son Albus, and Malfoy's son Scorpius.

Albus is a lot like Harry, he likes to ""fix"" things which usually means he is getting into trouble.  Scorpius, is nothing like his father.  He is kind and he befriends Albus right off.

These two remind me so much of Harry and Ron.  Albus and Harry do not get a long very well, and when he befriended Scorpius Harry forbade him to see him anymore.  As a parent of a teenagers I know that is the WRONG thing to say...hehe

Needless to say, Albus and Scorpius set off on an adventure to change the world so that Albus can make his dad proud.

This is such a wonderful read.  I cannot express that enough.  I weeped like a new born baby while reading this book.  I laughed, got mad, and a whole other plethora of emotions.  Rowling's writing goes beyond brilliant.  She makes a world come to life in ways I have never experienced with another book.  She has made these characters personal to me, and I love that more than anything.

If you haven't picked this book up, you should.  Especially if you are a Harry Potter fan.  I know there are so many nay sayers out there about this book, but in my opinion they don't know what they are talking about..hehe

I hope there are more to come.  I hope they make this into a movie or bring the play to America.  I need more Harry Potter in my life.  It just makes me happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  I read the book in a couple of hours on the day after I received it.  This story was written in play form and does not have the in depth descriptions that the original seven books have.  It picks up with the story nineteen years after the defeat of Voldemort, with Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione taking their children to King's Cross Station to put them on the train to Hogwarts. Then it tells about the adventures of Harry and Ginny's son Albus.
  The story is not of the same writing quality as the original seven books but it is a different form (play) and if performed, would be fleshed out a bit.  I enjoyed reading it.  I am interested in reading anything Harry Potter and hope there are more  books, plays,  etc. coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is a great book that's written as a stage play.  It's a great next phase for those of us who want to know what's happened to Harry and his family.  I love the fact that some roles are reversed - Harry's son vs Draco's son and that the two boys have some interesting adventures.

Over the last few months I have actually read this a few times. Each time I read something new, if that makes any sense.

I can't imagine a world where Ron and Hermione aren't together or where Cedric is a death eater (wtf to that!). Now that I see what a Time Turner can do, I'm not so sure that I want one anymore. Granted Malfoy had his made, but the consequences are far too great, especially toward the end. Talk about bravery. WHEW!

I'll tell you there are some things to say, and while I shall admit my biases regarding almost anything Harry Potter related, you'll still find I found some things to critique.

As I've said before, the bias I have regarding this book is immense, and I apologise ahead of time!

The Good:
Harry Potter and the characters - need I say more!? This was actually the best part to me about reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child because it gave all of us fans and readers a chance to see an adult Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The most wonderful thing about seeing these characters evolve is that some have changed for the better, and some have stayed the same.
There was no inner dialogue, therefore you are left to your own devices to figure out who the characters really are. Some may actually place this within the 'Bad' things about this book, however I really enjoyed it. It left me to my own devices to judge these characters, and also learn how true they were to themselves through the dialogue itself. If you've read all the Harry Potter novels, than at this stage of the game, not having an inner dialogue doesn't ruin anything because of our own innate knowledge of these characters.

The Bad:
The writing style was not necessarily in line with J.K. Rowling pieces of work. This is minuscule however, because the knowledge of how it was primarily written by the playwrights themselves made it forgivable. It also wasn't detrimental to the entire reading of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I guess for me it was just things that didn't quite fit in the way I read these novels when I've known them since I was young.
This book didn't stick to some historical scenes. For any new readers out there, or individuals not attached to Harry Potter like some fans are, than this small piece is also miniscule. The thing about the scenes that held no 'historical' significance is more or less along the lines of how these scenes were Harry Potter's memories of when he was younger, and in those scenes what was said in the book was slightly different than the play. In regards to the history of some of the events unfolding in the novel when Albus and Scorpius go back in time, it definitely deviated from some of the moments of history - but only in the regards (once again) of what was said. (Not a big deal though!)
Overall, as a heavily biased Harry Potter fan I can't help but to give this new book 4.5 stars out of 5. If I was unbiased based on the above facts, I would most likely rate this closer to a 3.75 or 4... As such though, I still stand by my love for Harry Potter and everything to do with the Wizarding World.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having lived into my 50's I understand that people change, life has a way of wearing off those sharp edges of passion, the youthful idealism. I could understand how the routine of working, raising kids in a V free world, would make things much less intense for the adult Harry and his friends.  Ron, Harry, and Herimone  still have their friendship that was so special. Even Draco talks about how they shone with love for each other. They see how Draco loves his son, and let him in, let him help. Draco grows and changes too. And while nAlbus goes through some dark times,  it is his friendship with Scorpius that ends up saving him and saving everyone and reminding them all over again the value of friendship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But this is not really new ground, and that is ok because Ms Rowling has already outdone herself. She has no obligation to wow me anymore. The characters have aged appropriately and have the appropriate amount of angst. The next generation of characters were presented well, but it is difficult to feel the same emotion toward them. Don't read this if you haven't been a fan. If you are a fan, be prepared for the script formula instead of the usual narrative and scene descriptions. The introduction of time travel was a possible segue into a new series of stories: what if this person had lived/died and how would the rest of the characters evolved?

BUt it was on Amazon for like $1 so I bit the bullet.  And then in true Harry Potter fashion I sat down and read it in one sitting.  It was truly a lovely story.  Harry and company have grown into adults with real important jobs and families, but have remained friends and famous.  The kids have started Hogwarts.  All is not well though. Harry and his son don't get along and then Harry's scar hurts for the first time in 20 years and creatures are moving in strange ways.  How can this be and what does it mean?  Harry learns some lessons as a man that would serve us all well to remember.

Garcia","Spell Binding","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2019","I almost didn’t read thing because the reviews were so harsh, but the plot on wiki sounded like something I wanted to happen since book one. This epic story comes in the form of a play manuscript and leaves much up to the imagination! If you are strong with your own HP imagery, then this will be a pleasure to read. It will take a couple of chapters to get used to the format, no doubt, but press on! Just when you think you have it figured out, there is a plot twist I had not seen coming.
As a writer, I become skeptical when authors don’t push plots to their full interest. This story reveals layer by layer a question I have been asking for eons: “What would happen if Potter got sorted into Slytherin?” But then it goes a step further than you can imagine. This is all I can say without revealing spoilers about this spellbinding book. The whole cast and crew is present to assist with an epic tale. Prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime and (PLEASE) don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Both Broadway and small theaters to even school plays and everything in between.  While reading this book, I was so intrigued by the pace of the story, but also could not see how you can have 15 to 25 scenes in a Act.  So what did I do?  Well thanks to this book, I booked a week in London to go and see the play.

What Harry receives from his parents is passed on to his own son much like we see in many tales of literary adventure like the vampire slayer von Helsing family or Gregory Maguire's character Elphaba. The theme of geerational karma emphasizes Universal Truths of good and evil with which humans must constantly struggle. Many times a certain family is chosen to serve as hero for the masses, like the Potter family in this series. And, of course, we readers may suspect that the Potter family will continue defending humanity in the future whether the stories are written or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It brings you back t the wonderful world of magic we all loved as kids and young adults. If you grew up with Harry Potter books you are going to love it. The script format is great and can be read novel wise since stage directions are written in novel form without actually being stage directions ( they keep the magical moments magical). If you are not a huge reader it is in my opinion easier to read, since this format made my sister want to read it and that girl won't pick up a book o save her life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
