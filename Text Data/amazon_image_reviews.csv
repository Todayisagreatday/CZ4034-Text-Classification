I can't understand how JKR thought this would be a great conclusion to the story we all lived and breathed. I know she hasn't penned most of the play and that shows (really really shows) but I issue is how did she let them blemish the legacy in such a silly and almost immature manner. It's literally like the people who worked on this script didn't understand Harry Potter through ages. They just had some material but it wasn't a living thing for them. I swiped page to page hoping things would pick up. It didn't. The way they changed certain intricate attributes of the trio.. it's unforgivable. I mean the Starkids play on Harry Potter (how much ever they were made for laughs) stayed true to the Harry Potter spirit than this play/script. I do not have an issue that it was in the play format. My issue is this script is about a group of people who are in the Wizarding World that we all love, but they surely aren't anyone we know, understand or love.

What a disappointment.

As J.K. Rowling did not write the book, the characters in the play feel like strangers. The tone of the book is just...off. The plot-line is weird, and doesn't follow along with the logic and rules established in the series.

Personally, I think this book reads like fan-fiction - but BAD fan-fiction, to say the least. I spent my teenage years on sites like MuggleNet, and I have definitely read some good Harry Potter fan-fiction in the past.

This story just feels wrong, and is totally amateurish. If you're not a die-hard Harry Potter fan, you might enjoy this story for the entertainment value, but as a die-hard fan, I was supremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HDELLmwnL._SY88.jpg,,

So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.

There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.

Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(",2.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814gtm0jp6L._SY88.jpg,,

I wasn't able to go to the crushed child's opening because of work. I picked the book up today and while reading I melted. This is not J.K. Rowling writing. This is a lot of someone else's. There is no excitement, no magic, no feeling. The only reason I have given this book 3 stars is because part four is J.K Rowling writing and you can feel it with every ounch of your body. Part four brings you back to the Harry Potter you grew up loving. I will say no true Harry Potter fan won't cry in part four because of the history behind it. We all have that moment when we wounder about potter and James death and what Harry would do and this bring you to that. I haven't cried like that since Severus killed Dumbledore. Part four makes the whole book. Sadly this can never be a movie with out there being more heart to it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81psUDv2lFL._SY88.jpg,,

All in all, it was definitely entertaining BUT as it is a script and as it is NOT written by JK Rowling, it is not the Harry Potter we know and love.

I won't get into the details of the plot, but I will say that the storyline was entertaining and it was interesting to see a glimpse into how things may have gone if Voldemort had triumphed. Unfortunately you can't really savor any part of the story for long because it was written without any of the frills and beautiful description from JK Rowling.

Now before you criticize me, I GET that it was a play and that you can really only write what can be seen on stage, but with the previous 7 novels setting the bar so high, this was fairly disappointing in comparison. Some of the other reviews are pretty accurate in saying it reads like a polished fan fiction.

All criticism aside, the story was fun and because it was a script, it was a very quick read. Overall, it was exciting to go to a midnight release party for an HP book again!! Nostalgia!",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BVhQpMvzL._SY88.jpg,,

Hughes,If only...,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2016","Although the story had potential I think first of all keeping it in script form was a mistake.  I didn't mind it so much but it seems many other readers had a problem with it.  Next, to give Voldemort a ""love"" child was a stretch, I think he was as repulsed by the notion  of physical love as Sheldon Cooper and anyone he'd deemed worthy to carry his heir would most certainly been less in battle and more in hiding.

Voldemort wouldn't have sired an heir anyway as he'd already planned his immortality, and it wasn't in any way going to be vicariously done.  A hapless minion who felt cheated of a promised station, such as Lucious Malfoy would have been more believable.  Lucious would have been desperate to re-elevate the Malfoy name and redeem himself to the Dark Lord and taken great satisfaction in destroying Harry Potter's past and future to do so.

While I enjoyed revisiting old friends I have to say it felt like they had some other engagement and had rushed the visit.  Indeed such an event merited a two part series but in separate books with a bit more character development and a cliff hanger at the end of the first book.  J.K. Rowling should have followed her original formula and banged out a story on her own and then allowed a playwright artistic license.

Indeed, thank you for the story, and do come again, only this time when you can stay longer and be more at home.

Best wishes,

I have an idea - everyone, who is as disappointed as I am, let's send our books back to Rowling! How come her name appeared on this?.. Do not spend your money and time. It's a disaster.

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, TEN pages! 10 pages for 4 years. Still, it could have been good if there were no such horrible mistake which make me think that the authors consider readers/audience complete idiots. SPOILER: Act three in the end: Albus is left without his wand which has been taken from him and snapped. This fact was mantioned two times. Act four: ""Albus opens both doors with his wand"".

Reading that ""19 years later"" at the end of Deathly Hallows left me angry. Because I wanted more. I remember thinking ""she should have written another book, what is this epilogue crap"". And more I got, although not in the way I wanted. The rumors that weren't really rumors are true. The book is a script of the play that was performed in London. It is not an actual novel, that was the most disappointing part for me. Once I got past that, once I was able to go back to visualizing the characters, I found myself speeding through the book. Whatever J. K. Rowling touches, it is spun gold. Following the trio 19 years later, meeting the cursed child, my eyes flew across the page and transported me back to the days I would curl up on the couch and not move until the book was done. My have I missed those days. The hardest part for me was realizing that this is actually the end. That anything else, should it happen, that is Rowlings Magic related, will be in the form of a spinoff. And it's left me as heartbroken as the day I finished Deathly Hallows. However, every and all spinoffs that should happen shall be consumed eagerly by me. The magic will always live on. Always.
If you were apprehensive about reading it because you aren't sure if it'll ruin the series for you, read it anyway. No one will do you justice like the form of Rowlings writing style.

I haven't been this disappointed in a book probably ever. Harry Potter, like many readers, has been a constant comfort and escape for me ever since I started reading when I was about nine. It was the series that gave me confidence, the urge to read, and a connection with my grandmother who passed away in 2008 almost a year after the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out.

I was excited about the idea of the Cursed Child play because that meant we would have more stories with the characters I grew up with, even if there was a almost no chance I'd ever see the play. My excitement and anticipation skyrocketed when I heard they were going to be publishing the script. I was a bit bummed about the format, hoping that maybe J.K. Rowling would write the story in novel form, and I was bummed when we found out that Rowling wouldn't be writing it. But I was still optimistic. Queen Rowling wouldn't put her stamp of approval on something that she didn't 100% believe was ready for publication.

Unfortunately, as you could probably tell by the rating this script/book did not live up to almost any of my expectations. Because I don't really know where to start, I am just going to list out my pros and cons of the story. THERE WILL BE SPOILERS AFTER THIS.

PROS:
I absolutely loved that Albus Severus Potter was sorted into Slytherin house. Having positive examples of Slytherin students is something I feel like was missing in the original books. We had a few adults like Narcissa Malfoy and Slughorn who both definitely redeemed themselves  but I always wanted a student  that readers who identified Slytherin had to look up to or admire. I wish there was a example of a Hufflepuff, because there's even few known Hufflepuff characters that have their own moments and personalities. I feel like both Slytherin and Hufflepuff get shafted in the original series. Unfortunately Hufflepuff doesn't get much of a mention in this story either but I do think Albus being a Slytherin is a step into the right direction.

I liked what we saw of how Ron grew into being a father, husband, and uncle. He still had his same Ron personality of thinking about food, being over protective, and being down right hilarious but he also did a lot of ""dad-jokes"" and had pretty much been a walking step-by-step instruction on how to embarrass your kids. It was great. I liked how affectionate he was with Hermione, and how he announced that he wanted to re-do his vows with her. She was the same kind of stern but melty Hermione around him. I love them together. I am happy they stayed together. After Rowling's bomb (which I do not, and will not, ever agree with) that she doesn't think they should have been together in the end I was worried she would have them end up divorced or something by the end of the play. Thank God that didn't happen.

This one is a weird PRO. But I liked that Amos Diggory was a complete jerk. It felt very familiar, hating the entitled snark that was Amos. I had this real hatred for him when I read Goblet of Fire for the first time. Of course, I sympathized with him at the end of the book when Cedric dies, but I still did not like him one bit. Now knowing the end of the story I wonder if him going to the Potter's residence was of his own choice, or if Delphi cursed him somehow or even just convinced him. But still, Amos being  a complete jerk at least felt familiar.

I did enjoy Harry's conversations with painting Dumbledore. I don't know too much about how the talking to painting things really work. I always assumed that when a witch or wizard gets painted that version of themselves is what stays immortal so anything the actual person learns or experiences doesn't have any effect on the painting. So because I don't know when Dumbledore was painting I am not sure how much closure Harry really got. But I am happy he got something, because he really let out some intense feelings towards painting Dumbledore. Things he didn't get to say in King's Cross because of the shock of being killed and him still being a boy missing his mentor and friend.

I liked Draco's relationship with his son. He really loves his son and it shows. Lucius Malfoy was never a great father. He was abusive and manipulative and it shows that Draco wants to do better towards Scorpius. I really feel like Draco redeemed himself in this book. He still bickered with the trio, but it was (most of the time) more friendly than angry. You could see a forming of an alliance, or even a friendship.

I also really liked Albus and Scorpius's friendship. I liked that their outcast personalities drew them together and that Albus didn't judge Scorpius about the rumors about him. It reminded me of when Harry didn't judge Ron because of the way his family was perceived by Draco. Albus at times reminded me a lot of a younger Harry. However, they are obviously in love from their dialogue and the way they act around each other. Plus other characters perspectives. I feel like the writers wanted to bait the fans that would have liked seeing a LGBT+ couple in HP but they didn't want to take that last step and make it official. Ridiculous.

When Harry transforms into Voldemort, although it was a awkward scene (more in that in my cons), I like that he completely sucked at acting like an evil Dark Lord. It reminded me of when the trio break into the Ministry of Magic in Deathly Hallows and they suck at pretending to be someone they're not. It had me laughing.

The scene after Harry witnesses his parent's death, when Hagrid walks into the house and finds Lily and James dead. When he talk to Harry and picks him up. More on Hagrid later, but he's one of my top five favorite characters and I am so happy to see that moment with Hagrid and Harry. I know we get a piece of it in Deathly Hallows, and maybe it's because this was a new perspective but I definitely had tears in that moment. However, wasn't Sirius already there with his motorcycle when Hagrid shows up? In HPatCC Hagrid enters an empty house.

CONS:
We jump between small moments for about three years at the Potter's time at King's Cross Station every September 1 we see Albus go from this innocent but nervous kid to a complete jerk who is an ass to Harry. Because of the fact that we don't see why he becomes so angry and why he hates Hogwarts so  much and it makes him seem angry and irrational for no reason. Honestly it's kind of draining an gets a bit annoying at times. If some sort of specific incidents were referenced or played out showing Albus being picked on by his fellow classmates maybe it would make more sense. Scorpius, who has a stupid rumor over his head and has a real reason to hate his classmates seems to love Hogwarts. He loves to learn and he loves being able to be with his best friend.

Talking about the rumor, damn it was dumb. They wanted the reader to know that there was a chance someone would shack up with Voldemort and have a kid and they tried making us believe that the kid was Scorpius. Which didn't work because like Scorpius says, he looks just like his father Draco. Plus, why would going back in time and having Voldemort's son be Draco and Astoria's decision after not being able to have children? Voldemort tortured and royally screwed up the Malfoy family (who, of course kind of did it to themselves - but still) so why would Draco have his wife go and have sex with the man who he probably really hates? It just seemed to make zero sense as a rumor.

The trolley witch, why? Really - why? It made no sense. Why did she need to turn into a spiky  monster thing. Why was that pointless part in there?

I didn't like that Rose was barely a character in the story. I thought she was going to be the girl for their trio, so when it turned out not to be the case I was really bummed. Especially when thinking about the play itself. They made the bold and awesome move to have two women of color play Hermione and Rose and they are barely in the story. I understand Hermione, because the story is about the children more than the parents. But Rose seemed like a cool character. She reminded me so much of Hermione in so many ways but at the same time she had the same judgment (when Albus and Rose meet Scorpius for the first time) sometimes a young Ron carried with him. Why have all the drama and news about having two beautiful (and from what I hear - amazing actresses) women of color be characters that many people for many years thought of as white characters to not use them? I pictured all these little girls and boys who had darker skin going to see the play and seeing Rose as this bad-ass witch and relate. But she wasn't in enough to make enough of an impression which is a real bummer. Now knowing how long they are in the story it feels more like a publicity stunt.

I know that the story mostly focuses on Albus and Scorpius, but I would have liked to see more of the other Potter and Granger-Weasley children. It also would have been nice to see more of Ginny's feisty side and Harry's funny endearing side. Everyone seems to be really awful to Harry in this book, and it made me feel for him. For a moment I honestly thought he was going to die in the end to save his son because of how awful everyone was being to him.

All the time travel seemed pointless because in the end, nothing was changed when it came to timelines. So it seemed like a complete waste of time. I am not against time travel, if it is done right I can really get into it. I loved it in Prisoner of Azkaban. The only time the time travel seemed to really matter was the very last time, and even then I could have lived without it because of how absolutely ridiculous it was. I also don't like that we see Severus Snape. He tells Scorpius to tell Albus that he is proud that Albus has 'Severus' as his middle name but it seemed completely out of place. Maybe because I still think it's absolutely ridiculous that Harry named his kid after a man who tormented him and his friends for years because Harry looked like his dad and because Snape couldn't get with Lily. But that's a little off topic. It just seemed out of Snape's character. Because that version of Snape that feels like he failed Lily on keeping Harry safe doesn't exist, and I don't think it ever would exist. I am not a fan of Snape as a person. He's an amazingly fascinating character but as a person I hate him so much. So for him to have any redemption just made me roll my eyes. It seemed fake and too cheesy for me. Also: because in this time line Ron and Hermione aren't together she is a grumpy old spinster? I don't understand. Hermione is a brave, smart, dependent woman without Ron. I think he writers were trying to parallel her to McGonagall but the problem with that is the writer doesn't know the character well enough so it came off like without Ron, Hermione would never fully be happy with her life. And although I love them together, I think they would both be fine without each other. I just think they're stronger together.

Harry had a bad childhood. He was starved and neglected. I know we don't see Harry as a toddler almost at all with the Dursley's but I assume he was never shown any real love which is something every child needs and deserves to grow up healthy. The fact that Harry went though that and still had such an open heart to Ron, Hermione, the professors at Hogwarts, and the Weasley family is some sort of magic in its own right. Because of this, having Harry tell Albus that he wishes Albus was never his son after Albus says he wishes Harry wasn't his father seemed wrong. Even in the heat of the moment. I know Harry has had a short temper in the past during stressful times. I know he regretted it the moment he said it. But I still don't think it's something Harry would say to any of his kids.

No Neville really pissed me off. Neville killed Nagini! He was the final piece into saving the wizarding world. And all we get is a few references? And no Teddy Lupin! I wanted to know the kind of person he would be. I wanted to see parts of my favorite Marauder shine through his kid. I wanted him to have cool colored hair and a mischievous grin like his mom. No future Hagrid mentioning at all. What the actual crap is that? I may be a bit biased about Hagrid, but it's more than that. If Hagrid saw that Albus was having troubles he would have without a doubt taken Albus under his wing and made sure he was loved. Does that mean he's dead? (Nope I am never ever accepting that. Nope) Because if not then I am a little relieved, but mostly upset he was forgotten about. But sure, let's have a scene with the random Trolley Witch and annoying extra time travel scenes that pretty much lead nowhere. That makes total sense.

How did Scorpius, Delphi, and Albus brew a Polyjuice Potion so quickly? It takes a month to successfully brew a Polyjuice potion. How did they expect to do it at the end of the story while waiting for Voldemort? Hermione you're literally standing right there, you brewed the potion when you were eleven years old. YOU KNOW it takes a month. It's not an option. The group comes to the conclusion it isn't an option because you need a bit of someone to use the potion to transform into another witch or wizard. But no one mentions it also takes a whole month!

How can Albus and Scorpius peak into the house and see Lily and baby Harry when the house is protected by a Fidelius charm? It makes no sense.  Also - right after that scene when they get the idea to write a message (and destroy Harry's last childhood possession. Good job Albus) on Harry's baby blanket, why do we skip the cool and probably hilarious scene of the boys sneaking into the house to steal the blanket from baby Harry? How did they get the blanket without being caught and then have the time to write the message and slip the blanket back into its rightful spot?

The fact that Delphi was Voldemort and Bellatrix's love child is absolutely absurd. Even if Voldemort would have the urge to have sex with anyone (which, I honestly don't think he would. Especially after he lost his pretty boy body/face and turned into a white gross red eyed snake man) why the hell would anyone have sex with a white gross red eyed snake man?! I knew Bellatrix was insane, but really? Also - wouldn't someone notice that Bellatrix was carrying a child? She says she has the baby before the Battle of Hogwarts. So did no one realize that Bellatrix had gotten enormously round during Half Blood Prince? She was standing there the night Dumbledore dies. She was never described as pregnant. Or even when Bellatrix was torturing Hermione in Dealthy Hallows? Nothing makes sense.

On the awkward scene with Harry transforming into Voldemort. Is that a thing? Can you transform witches and wizards into other witches and wizards? Wouldn't everyone do that instead of making Polyjuice Potion and having to wait a whole month? It seemed very convenient.

It seemed fairly easy to detain Delphi, even after she realized Harry wasn't the greatest actor in the world and he wasn't Voldemort.  There were a few quick spells back and forth and the Hermione [as always] jumps in like a BAMF and ties her up with a brachiabindo binding spell. She didn't seem like much of a real threat.

Why exactly did Harry have to stick around and watch his parents die exactly? Hasn't he been through enough crappy situations? It's bad enough he remembers pieces of it as a child, does he have to see the whole thing? It seemed unnecessary.

Harry is scared of pigeons? It's so random. Maybe I'm just nitpicking now because I'm wound up and angry. But it seems so annoyingly outrageous.

Seriously this book reads like the authors scrolled down fanfiction.net, wrote down plot points other people did that they liked and then published the first draft. It reads like a cheesy not well thought out Disney channel show episode.

Not plot point cons:
The fact that it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling showed in the writing. It didn't have the same writing style, which makes sense because everyone has their own style but the problem is I don't think Jack Thorne is that great of a dialogue writer from what we were given. And since scripts are mostly dialogue it wasn't a great experience. The dialogue was stiff and unnatural. No one really talked like how actual people talk. I am hoping that the actors maybe change the words around to make it seem less fake? If not I can't imagine how awkward it is to watch on the stage. Even the way the setting was set up in between scenes, the way the words were strung together read awkwardly. It felt like a really bad fanfiction. I don't read much fanfiction, especially not Harry Potter fanfiction but the ones I have read seemed better than what was given us in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I am just surprised and deeply disappointed that J.K. Rowling let this get published without making sure it all made sense and that the writing was polished. This will not ever be cannon for me. I don't think I will be forgetting the story any time soon, but I am treating it fully as fanfiction.",1.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W34a2rMgL._SY88.jpg,,

I will preface this by saying that I will love Harry Potter, ""Always.""
I wish I could say that I was under the Imperius Curse giving this 3 stars.

If you read the script objectively, not expecting it to be a continuation of the novels, it is more enjoyable. Seeing the play in person would give MUCH more personality to the characters and greatly enhance the magic of each scene.  I suppose I would rather have been able to read the story this way, then not at all.
I have a family member that saw the West End Production and said it was an INCREDIBLE experience - every detail was thought out and it was like real magic. I believe that.

Reading ""Cursed Child"" as a script doesn't have the same feel as reading the novels.
I missed Harry's internal thoughts that gave him depth in the first 7 books. This was forgivable since the characters' personalities still showed through their dialogue and stage directions.  Breaking the fourth wall may have been cheesy or awkward on stage, while on the other hand, some of the corny humor would be more comical watching the play with the right delivery. It's nearly impossible to envision the intricacies of the scenery, music, and effects on stage by reading this. I'm rating the script with that knowledge and not at face value. If I were to compare it to the last 7 books, zero stars would be appropriate.

The scene designations help set the stage for the characters both in the wizarding world and in the play, which made this a unique addition to the series. The pace moves VERY fast in the play compared to the past books.  This left little time for character and relationship development, but that is understandable given the format.

I was looking forward to reading this as a play, that is not the issue. The story itself has a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies (especially in ""rules"" of magical objects), and things left unexplained. Some favorite characters were thrown into the story, just for the sake of making an appearance. I wish I liked the story better than I did, but it was so cliche and predictable. Promoting this as the ""Eighth Story"" gave me false hope. It was more like a quick glance into one messy event in their future. I wish I could see the play because the superb acting, music, and exciting effects may have made the plot bearable. I LOVE Harry Potter and I wanted to love this script.

As for the ""secrets,"" grab a chair, some butterbeer and start reading.

****Character Analysis - Read ahead if you do not mind learning about some characters' personalities and backgrounds - Does not ruin the plot******

The beloved wizards we grew up with are still relevant and relatable as they have, like us, grown older and are experiencing life in a whole new light. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's personalities are somewhat consistent with the previous stories, but have evolved as they are now tackling marriage, careers, and the joys/worries of parenthood. There are moments when they are familiar, and others when you wonder what the authors were thinking. Did the creative, imaginative J.K. actually write this?

Although the story does focus a lot on their children, the baton has not completely been passed.  There were some positives. Ron's sardonic comments made me chuckle. Ginny's dry humor and quips are more profound. Hermione's intelligence, helpfulness, and compassion are endearing. Harry's fierce passion for his loved ones and what he believes, along with other traits that make these characters who they are, gave me a sense of nostalgia. I feel like Harry had time to become his true self, without the weight of Voldemort and being the ""chosen one"" on his shoulders. Although, as one can imagine, his past still haunts his life in unexpected ways.

We are even treated to the delightful, lip curling, Draco. I must say though, adulthood looks decent on him, even if it makes him a very inconsistent character.

The new generation of characters all have personalities that make sense. Rose Granger-Weasley (how fitting is that surname?) is brilliant, and a bit bossy like her mother, but is more confident in her abilities since she comes from a wizarding family.  She is quick to judge like her father, and this flaw can get the best of her, despite her good intentions and other enormous talents.

Albus Severus has not only the Potter name to live up to, but the great wizards he was named after who sacrificed their lives for the greater good. Plus, spending the last 11 years with his boisterous older brother James Sirius has molded him as the more reserved of the two. James could be the reincarnation of a stag we once knew; are we sure Harry decided not to use the resurrection stone?  This isn't to say Albus doesn't have his own voice. The House he is selected for is fitting, and with the help of his supportive parents and loyal friend, he is more than just an introverted, misunderstood teenager.

If an anthem was written about Scorpius Malfoy it would be entitled, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" He is eccentric and desperate for a real connection, being raised under an isolated, overprotective, household.  Scorpius is sharp, friendly, and intuitive. His childhood could be compared to the boy who lived in a cupboard under the stairs. Only, his cupboard extends through a Manor with an extensive library from the magical world; he at least knows who he is and where he is going.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71guCIShWZL._SY88.jpg,,

Reading this Harry Potter book feels different, obviously, than the previous seven, as it is written as a play. I liked seeing how much can be done using (almost) only dialogue, and I liked how it felt like slipping right back into the world of characters I—along with the rest of the world—came to know and love so well. I am not, however, a fan of time travel, which was central to this book’s plot so that detracted a bit for me. Still, it’s a fun, must-read book for the Harry Potter world, which let’s face it, along with Frozen, we’re all just living in.

I was so excited to read this but I'm left incredibly disappointed. It's a really quick read which is probably the only reason as to why I decided to finish.
There were parts in the book that made me laugh out loud and parts that broke my heart and made me cry, those parts are because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were so out of character, some of the things that were said are things I never thought would come from their mouths.
This book has a lot to do with the past, the Triwizard Tournament and Halloween of 1981. The authors of this book created all new lines, Ludo Bagman is introducing the victors of the tournament and his lines don't match up to what was said in the 4th Harry Potter book. They changed the what happened in the past for no apparent reason. I kept waiting for Harry to say ""that's not what happened"", ""he wasn't the first one there"".
The writing was cheesy, the storyline was cheesy. I complete agree with the people who said this book feels like fan fiction. That's exactly what this is. Everything has changed and not in a good way.
If you can forget the Harry Potter series and everything that we know happened, I can see how people find this book to be amazing and love it so much.

Its been a while since I have read with such childlike voracity...not since the first time I read the original HP books at least. Never have I been so absorbed in my mind, removed from the world, or have experienced physical gasps of surprise and an influx of heartbeats. I'll deliver the ugly first: technically, the play is no masterpiece. It does not compare to the original story, and I am almost certain nothing will. But what I find extraordinarily transforming, striking, and satisfying about Cursed Child is its finality. I didn't realize when I finished the Original 7 that there was so much missing--so many words left aching to be delivered, resolutions to be undone and rewrapped. I felt my breath escape me within the play's pages. Moments and scenes left me achingly pounding and gloriously hungry.

What I love most--Cursed Child reintroduced all of the important characters and shuffled them off them with more care. Within the pages I heard voices of people I believed we would no longer hear from--and took them away just as gently...like catching a fish, tenderly unhooking it's squirming silver body, and laying it in the water again, witnessing its shimmering scales slink away. This time, I think, it was easier to leave the Wizarding World because I knew I had to.

Parts of the story itself felt a little overdone and rushed, but you must keep in mind that this addition is originally intended to be watched, not read, with delivery fitting under a specific window of time. For this I know I did not experience the full breath and absorption of Cursed Child during my read-through, and I am sure live-performance characteristics such as dialectic nuances and set transformations would definitely expand this work even more, but just reading the play itself took me back into this world of magic, mishap, and mischievousness that Potterheads are long-time familiar with. I am curious how the experience of watching it live differs, and cannot wait to see it when I have the chance.

L. Schneider,Two lies are written on the back of this book,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","The first, that this is the 8th story. It's not. This is a guy writing fan fiction and slapping JK's name on the cover so it will sell. The second is that it's 19 years later. No. The events in this book happen 22 years later.

It's a shame because there's a lot of possibility here. There are interesting storylines taking place here, they just aren't executed on the level we've come to expect from a Rowling product. I'm a sucker for a good time travel story, as well as revisiting beloved characters much later in life. But this isn't how these characters act. Albus should never have been this whiny. I liked him in the 7th book. I liked Harry in the original 7. But, here, the characters have become annoying or flat. With Ron he was actually just describing either Fred or George!

I also just wasn't a fan of how entwined in the story Harry was. Like, I've already seen him and everything he's capable of in the original 7 books. Now, he's a blubbering fool. You can't sit there and tell me that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to run to Ginny every time he has a minor problem. That and I don't want to read about his life working a 9 to 5. I work a 9 to 5. That's not interesting to me because I live it everyday. Give me more Albus and Scorpius!

The only intriguing part of this for me was when we focus solely on the kids. No, they don't act like normal kids, but honestly, I just wanted to see how they would interact with each other. I know the adult's story and I just want to focus on someone else, now.

Another very problematic thing for me was the fact that we spend a good chunk of the book fast forwarding to get where we need to be. Why waste all that time? Why not start us where we need to be? Why not go further in depth for the moments you do skip over? Entire books could be written for the amount of time we skipped in the beginning of this book. I wanted much more from this story. Answer some how's and why's while you're skimming through the years.

No one can write these characters or this universe like Rowling and no one should. I'm going to have to exclude the ""8th"" story from my yearly reading of these books, unfortunately. Fantastic Beasts looks great, though, and that is a truly Jo Rowling production.",3.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71t+JTTLQ5L._SY88.jpg,,

I will be honest, I didn't want to set my expectations too high (despite waiting in line and attending a pre-lease party to grab the hardcover at midnight), so I did not reread the series this summer as I normally do, as readers should understand although Rowling is given some credit I give most credit to the other two, especially due to the format and style.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS, READ AT OWN RISK
Pros:
1. Personally, as a huge theatre geek I actually quite liked the script format, adding to why I rated this so high. Yes, I miss J.K. Rowling's writing and would prefer her for Harry rather than this, but I got used to the format. People must understand THIS WAS WRITTEN AS A PLAY and not a book, and that the printing of this just gave opportunity to muggles, witches, and wizards alike who don't have the chance to apparate, use floo powder, or fly (on brooms and planes alike) to see the show in London. Unfortunately, I do admit that because of the script format, it is also difficult to really immerse the reader into the setting.
2.  IT'S FREAKING HARRY POTTER. It was nice to see the old crew again. This book/script gave me the chance to fully be apart of and understand what it is like to wait in line, be part of crazy big crowds donned in costumes, and quickly read as soon as released. Plus, another story is another chance to read, well, another story based on a world so many have come to love.
3. Hermione as Minister for Magic. Yessss. Seeing her as a mean teacher was interesting too. Oh, and Ginny rocked as the voice of reason.
4. Scorpius! Love him. Also liked Draco and relationship with his son, and both their relationships with Astoria.
5. I liked how every little small thing the boys changed in time impacted the present.
6. Alternate worlds were interesting.
7. Giving props to old characters, little details that nodded to the series.
8. Harry and Albus, not so much their characters or shouting that they wish they didn't have each other as a father/son, but some of the raw relationship, such as being honest that the reason they don't understand one another isn't just because Albus is put into Slytherin.
Cons:
1. This story seemed more like fanfic.
2. The children besides Albus and Scorpius are introduced and then forgotten (besides Rose being savage). And I reallyyyy wished that there would be a main child/character who was in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, not just Gryffindor (Surprise! All kids except Albus from the main three are Gryffindor. No hate, I love all you guys, just babbling my opinions; it makes sense because of her their parents, but doesn't hurt to wonder).
3. Cedric becoming a deatheater because of his humiliation? Two best friends wanting to save him despite thinking about the consequences of messing with time? Oh boy.
4. What happened to our beloved characters? And the new ones? I understand that the format limits the description, but the dialogue sometimes... Ron as a comedic relief seemed to provide nothing to the story, make his character a bit corny, and his want of public affection with Hermione (not to mention Albus kissing his aunt because of this)? I don't know. Additionally, Albus seemed like a ""poor-me"" kid, Delphi seemed forced, etc ... Maybe it is just me ¯\_(?)_/¯
5. The whole freakout with Harry: ""I'm going to protect myself even if it means taking his only happiness, his friend Scorpius, because there is a black cloud over him. Also I am now threatening my previous professor-now-headmaster into watching his every move because she can't be busy with anything else."" I know it was a different world, and it was interesting; Harry doing anything for his son is believable, but I just couldn't settle on thinking Harry would go so far as to be so manipulative and threatening to his friends in a selfish (even though it was for his son) way.
6. Harry acting as/transfiguring into Voldemort. I don't think this was necessarily bad, I just don't know how to feel about it. I don't know how I feel about warrior Hermione or the fact that kids were able to get the time-turner from her office either (come on Hermione, you're smarter than that).
7. I feel there was this opportunity to show how the wizard world has changed since when the trio were students, and it wasn't used.

Okay, this is getting too long... phew. Thank you for reading, I hope my review didn't seem too whiny or dramatic! Overall, I think it is worth a read. I'll just leave it with this quote:
ROSE: The rumor is that [Scorpius] is Voldemort’s son, Albus.
It’s probably rubbish. I mean… look, you’ve got a nose.

This work is written in such a style to facilitate live performances. As such, it seems unfair to compare the extent to which characters are developed and the overall plot complexity to J.K. Rowling's original series. The original seven were not bound by the added task of producing a narrative which can easily be digested in a spoken format (in addition to proving itself worthy of the original series as a standalone literary text).

With that said, I found the latest installment of the Harry Potter series to be an enjoyable read in the sense that it allowed me to revisit old friends made many years ago (even if only for an afternoon). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reignited that childlike imaginative spark in me, which is the reason I fell in love with the world of Hogwarts in the first place. Without going into too much detail, the play focuses on the difficulty Harry and Ginny's son, Albus Severus, has with being the underperforming child of the ""the boy who lived"". Albus struggles with living up to the reputation of the Potter name, and subsequently becomes a bit of a loner who does not hold the same esteem for Hogwarts as his parents would have hoped. The piece also speaks to the difficulty Harry has parenting a somewhat rebellious Albus, who is often viewed by others to be ""different"". When Albus befriends the child of a certain former Slytherin house member with whom Harry shared several altercations with during his time at Hogwarts, Harry is tasked with determining whether he should intervene to keep Albus out of trouble, or rather to put his preconceived notions of Malfoy's only son aside and allow Albus to continue to spend time with his one true friend. In addition, Harry must also make Albus understand the difference between seeking out trouble versus confronting it when it presents itself to you -- a lesson Albus eventually learns throughout the course of the play.

If you're a fan of the original series, it's my recommendation you give this piece a try. It is a fast read, and an interesting spin on the original storyline - -  one in which a second generation of Potters, Weasley-Grangers, and Malfoys tantalize their parents and Hogwarts faculty members; a skill their parents mastered only 19 years prior.",4.0 out of 5 stars,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wVEw-sAbL._SY88.jpg,,
