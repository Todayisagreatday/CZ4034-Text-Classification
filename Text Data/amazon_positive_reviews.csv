How great was it to return to Hogwarts with another new adventure? My overall thoughts on The Cursed Child - loved it - and would absolutely love to see it on stage if I ever get to London again. My aim is not to include any spoilers in this review, so here goes.

It's widely known that The Cursed Child is the product of J.K.'s world and that it isn't a book completely penned by her as such, but a script for the London play. So, the first thing you need to do is keep that mindset ... it's full of dialogue that reads differently from a book but draws on the reader's own knowledge of the HP world for atmosphere and detail.

The focus of the story is on Harry's son, Albus, and Malfoy's son, Scorpius. Who would have thought I would find any son of Draco Malfoy likable? But they're not the total focus ... fans are rewarded with the return of all of their favourites, in one way or another.

We've all wondered what happened to Harry and Co after that last scene at Kings Cross in Deathly Halllows. Well this amazing story shows us what was, and what may have been. It's a great way of exploring how things in the past can impact the future, and of all the different possibilities, which I know have been thrown around by fans since HP7.

IMO I think that this one sits with true fans, in that the storyline pays tribute to many of the great things that we've read in the other books over the years. It's like we are returning to events and scenes, but with a slightly different perspective. We all have our own imagined visions of what happened in books 1-7, and of course, we've seen the movies that give us a great visual reference to look back on. I'm not sure that readers who haven't read HP or at least seen the movies (Are there any muggles like that?) would be able to translate the script into their imagination without prior knowledge of the settings and events it refers to.

Other reviews that I have read for HP8 have been mixed, but that's natural given that this series means so much to so many people. I had been looking forward to this book since I first heard it was coming, and now that I've read it, I have a tinge of sadness that it really is the last of the HP tales. They say .... all good things must come to an end ... but ... at least we have Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on the horizon to look forward to.

IN A NUTSHELL - Loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_441?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=441&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Maybe it was because I came in with such low expectations or maybe it was just because it's a great story, but I loved it. Yes, it's different from the original books. It's more character and dialogue driven, it is a script afterall, and because it's a script we miss out on some of the details that help really bring a story to life.  Also, it's a little more mature, Harry and the gang are forty now and some of the jokes kids won't relate to. But I don't think this story is really for children. Many of us grew up with Harry Potter, but now we're adults. This book deals heavily in relationships, mainly between fathers and sons and I think it did a great job. I know that many people were mad with how Harry acts towards Albus, but if there is one thing this book teaches us is learning that those you love aren't perfect. Though this book differs from the first seven it still has the components that made those seven great; adventure, heart and friendship. Also guys, it has time travel. Let me repeat, time- butterfly effect- travel. Which helps to tie it back into the world of the first seven books. The while time I was readibg it I thought; I can't wait to see how they do this on stage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","","3 people found this helpful"

I know that many may be tempted away from reading or purchasing Cursed Child because of rumors that it is written like fan fiction. However, what many people did not keep in mind when reading this book, is that it is not in fact a book, but rather a play. The story and plot points in the book are excellent and well worth reading. The writing may seem a bit rudimentary, but that is only because the gaps left in the text are filled in by the actors and set production in the live performance, which actually had rave reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_350?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=350&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Of course, I kept seeing the stars from the movies as the characters, but that is not a problem for me.  I was really surprised to find out who the ""Cursed Child"" really was, and I didn't like that person at all!  I hesitate to say much in case someone who hasn't read the play yet reads this.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed the read.

Rowling. Do not expect the same style","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019","I am happy i bought this overall... The book itself is not in any way written by j.k. Rowling. Do not expect her style of writing. It is however approved by her so i feel that's an important point to note.

This on my opinion is a fantastic book to have it you are a true Harry potter fan. It dives into the young Albus' life. And tells a different kind of story than Harry potter ever was. It is not about Harry anymore, but about his son. It is a lot about their bonds and how harry is learning to be a father now at this point in life.

It's the first time i have ever read a play besides in school. I read it in one day. It is not a long book. I mean it's like 300 pages but the text is spread out quite a bit. I had a great time reading it too... After starting, and this is the reason for four stars, it got slightly confusing with the quick flying through the years of Albus' life. I did not enjoy that particular part of the book very much and that's the point where i really noticed the different writing styles the most. i thought to myself i never would have gotten through all the Harry potter books of they were anything like that. I feel it could have been some thing like, beginning at Hogwarts, giving the background needed to get the story then go on to four years later and tell the story. That part was annoying and it's something i knew was going to end and i was just like, okay when will it be done. That is the only critical thing i have to say about the book. Which is pretty good since I'm choosy about my books. The screen play does not bother me a bit, I actually felt more there in the story than a lot of other books.  The story itself was great, i thought the characters were spot on,the personalities perfect, ups and downs and stuff i didn't expect but that added to the story so much. i love the overall additions this adds to the HP library... I still separate the Harry potter books in my head from this book but it's probably just because i have only read it once so far. I ummm love Harry potter, it's the best series i have ever read. I can read the books over and over.

AS a side note; I watched a documentary type deal on j.k. Rowlings decision to allow Jack Thorne and John tiffany to make this and she said she refused dozens of offers over the course of years before allowing any third party people touch her Harry Potter story. She did not decide on this book lightly. It is a great story and i would say a must of you are a Harry potter fan like i am. Even if it's separate In your head from up you'll be glad you read it, i was anyway. Hope this helps someone to decide. It's money will a on my opinion.... Also where else are you going to get an entire days worth of entertainment for $10??? Worth it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","","","null"

Garcia","Spell Binding","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2019","I almost didn’t read thing because the reviews were so harsh, but the plot on wiki sounded like something I wanted to happen since book one. This epic story comes in the form of a play manuscript and leaves much up to the imagination! If you are strong with your own HP imagery, then this will be a pleasure to read. It will take a couple of chapters to get used to the format, no doubt, but press on! Just when you think you have it figured out, there is a plot twist I had not seen coming.
As a writer, I become skeptical when authors don’t push plots to their full interest. This story reveals layer by layer a question I have been asking for eons: “What would happen if Potter got sorted into Slytherin?” But then it goes a step further than you can imagine. This is all I can say without revealing spoilers about this spellbinding book. The whole cast and crew is present to assist with an epic tale. Prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime and (PLEASE) don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","","","7 people found this helpful"

Quality: Excellent
Comments: I'll keep this spoiler-free as much as I can, but I can't believe anyone has actually waited to read this book! Awesome book! If you're expecting a typical Harry Potter read, though, this may not be for you. Just know that it is in script form. It will get your imagination working a little differently. It's a great visit with some beloved characters from the original series, but it's also an introduction to some new, lovable characters as well. Really interesting to see Harry and his contemporaries as adults, too. If you're into the whole concept of time travel, you have to read this book!
Pre-ordered and hoped it would arrive by release date, but it took Amazon a week past that to get it to me, so the waiting was the hardest part!
Here's what happened when I read:
1. I wanted to read the series again and go back to Hogwarts with Harry and the gang.
2. I got terrible cravings for Butterbeer at a certain Florida theme park.
3. I wanted to fly to London to see it on stage (but didn't).
4. For the first time ever, there were moments when I (gasp!) hated Harry Potter the character.
5. Enjoyed imagining how this would be staged and all the special effects that must be used.

Thanks for reading!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Did I like it? Yes. Yes, I did.

Now, this did not have the same magical feel as it would have had had it been written as a complete story and not just a play script. It's primarily dialogue. But I love dialogue, so that worked well for me. But descriptions, scene-building, etc, are mostly lost. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has never read Harry Potter before, as there are a lot of assumptions made about what the reader should already know. I've read other plays where there is much more description, so comparatively I cannot give this 5 stars because I think they could have done more.

But what they did include - the plot, the character interactions - was quite profound. I don't want to give away spoilers about the main conflict of the story, but the questions that arise were really thoughtful. I imagine fans of the series may have had these same questions after reading the series. So I love how the big plot point was adddressed. It makes the characters think, but makes the reader think as well. I thought it was a really fascinating twist on the HP world at large.

Of course, what really touched me were the characters. This was really a multi-generational story. We get our middle aged favorites, as well as their children. I loved wrapping myself up in all my love for these characters, old and new. The thought that went into Harry's relationship with his son, Albus, was very touching. I really liked how the father/son relationship was explored in all its complexities and I was really moved by it. I also loved the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. I loved seeing them as individuals, who they were in regards to their famous/notorious fathers raising of them, how they came into their own at Hogwarts, and who they became as they sought out such an unlikely but absolutely necessary friendship with the other. They were the sweetest besties. Even the healing of other older relationships was quite touching. And, of course, there was a cameo or two that tested my tear ducts and gave my heart lots of feels.

Overall, I really enjoyed this extra glimpse into the Harry Potter world. I simply love these characters. I would have loved an actual novel instead of a play, but regardless, I loved the overall story (and would love to see the play live).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I’ll admit it. Rowlings stories continue to be magical, even twenty years after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone came out. I’m sure I don’t need to go into the back story of Harry Potter for this review, because if you don’t know it, why the heck are you here?

Cursed Child takes place nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny are in their forties, and have kids in Hogwarts. This book focuses mainly on Harry and Ginny’s second child, Albus Severus Potter. Albus is very unlike Harry: he’s in Slytherin, for one, and counts as his best friend one Scorpius Malfoy. Harry, being Harry, and Albus, being a teenager, butt heads constantly, their personalities pinging off one another like rocks colliding in midair. I’m not going to get into the plot very much (or really at all), as I can’t find any way to describe it without HUGE spoilers (and god, but I hate spoilers). Suffice it to say that we get to revisit some classic bits from the original series, as well as find out some new stuff about the Harry Potter Universe.

Now for the nitty gritty: the book is not really a book but rather a play, which is going on in London right now (though again, if you didn’t know that . . .). What that means is: this book is written as a play, with dialogue and stage directions but little else. I’ll say the dialogue is spot on. I think the authors (Thorne and Tiffany) did a great job of capturing the characters. The dialogue flows like Rowling wrote it, and you can easily hear the character in the lines. the bad part of this is: it’s mainly just dialogue. There’s none of the little wonderful extras Rowling would slip in between the lines, the depth of field that makes the Potter Universe so compelling and so real. I’m sure seeing the play live takes care of most of that (can’t wait!), but in the reading you feel a little bereft.

The adventure is fun and engaging. The duo of Albus and Scorpius are just as compelling as Harry and Ron. And it’s great to see how the characters we already know and love, not just the big guys but also Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, and others have gotten on since we saw them last. Potterheads are going to love this expansion to the universe. My only wish would have been to have the thing rewritten into novel form by Rowling, but perhaps that’s just me being greedy.

I don't question that the London premier production is handling all these special effects magnificently, and wish I could see them do it in person. But if a school or community theater could manage them all, it would amaze me no end. And as a play, it seems largely to rely on these special effects, in an effort to beat the movies at their own special-effects game. The scenes are short and choppy; and it was sometimes difficult to follow which character(s) were the most focal ones. As a piece of theater, it came across to me as straining too hard to do too much. And even at that, I found there seemed to have been something crucial cut out in the subplot about Cedric Diggory. I should have preferred a more in-depth treatment with fewer scenes, but longer and more fully-developed ones; and something that school and community theaters could do more easily. I may be wrong: my fellow Harry Potter fans may find all the magic razzle-dazzle the important thing; but much as I have always enjoyed reading plays, I think I would have preferred this story in the form of an eighth novel, maybe even a trilogy of novels sequelizing the septology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Remember this is a play script so there are no colorful descriptions of location or of characters.  Sit down for 3-4 hours to read this straight through, use your imagination to see the Harry Potter world in your mind as this story unfolds and don't compare it to the books until you are done.  That way you can enjoy it for what it is and at times marvel at how are they doing the magic scenes on a stage during a live performance?!

I have been pumped for this ever since it was announced in 2015. I grew up with Harry Potter; I have read the books many times and havd watched the films many times. I own the ultimate editions so that I could have as many bonus features as possible. I recently bought the illustrated edition of the first book and plan on collecting the rest.

So it should come as no shock that my expectations for this story were very high. I read this script in just under 4 hours compared to the 3-4 days it would take me to read the books when they came out. So I had a lot to process quickly. One thing that stood out to me was, despite this taking much less time to read, the play feels epic and a good bit of time passes within it.
 Upon finishing, my feelings were mixed to negative. Some creative decisions were truly puzzling to me. But then I remembered that this is a play, not a novel or even a film. Visualizing this from a theatre perspective, I certainly gained an appreciation/understanding of why this story was told. Upon thinking even more, I want to re-read it and could find myself loving it.

Essentially, this story is about a parent and child learning to understand one another and appreciate one another. This is true for Harry and his son, Albus Severus and Draco and Scorpius (and another character that would be a huge spoiler that I won't mention). The contrasts between the fathers and sons are emphasized, hence why this story feels different from any other Potter story before. Albus Severus and Harry have almost nothing in common except blood. But what few traits they share are what bring them closer by the end.

Other beloved characters pop up. While they seem to behave in ways much different, we have to understand that they are at a different time in their lives and that (once again) this is a play. So certain things are played up for drama or comedy. Aside from the great new characters of Albus and Scorpius, I thought seeing Harry as a middle-aged adult was fascinating. My other favorite character was surprisingly Draco Malfoy.

If I have a criticism, it's that this story sometimes feels like a ""greatest hits"" of thr Harry Potter series. Upon re-thinking, I don't feel that way as much because it focuses on key events from the pass, not every event. It brings the past, present, and future together in a way that makes sense for the characters in this story. In my opinion, it actually does further the story quite a bit. And if Rowling or Jack Thorne ever did decide to continue this story, they certainly could take it to some interesting and different places.

My main issue with the play is not a big one, but it has to do with the villain. I like the villain, and the concept behind the character is interesting and plausible. However, I think an opportunity was squandered to go in a fresher, more inventive direction.

All in all, my opinion on this script has changed for the better. I actually appreciate the story and do consider it canon. There is an It's a Wonderful Life vibe to this story, and many of the creative choices do work, while some are more puzzling. Some plot points would benefit from a full novel or even a film in order to be fleshed out. However, I'm sure that watching the play is absolutely magical for any Harry Potter fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

In fact, you could read it with very little backstory and still enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_373?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=373&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It is not another fully fleshed out volume from J.K. It is a rehearsal script for a stage play.

Reading it can be difficult, although I quickly adapted and was able to immerse myself into the story.  Yes, the action moves very quickly and relies heavily on familiarity with the series for comprehension. There are a few plot holes that will enable die-hard PotterHeads to nitpick ad-nauseum, but overall the narrative stands as an acceptable addition to the series.  I won't harp on the shortcomings because they are far outweighed by the good exemplified by the relationship development between fathers, sons, and friends.  Harry and Draco find commonality as loving fathers that are having relationship difficulties with their sons who are best friends.  As stated, I can't wait to see this on stage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_424?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=424&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

That being said I now regret not being able to see the actual play, And how the action and special effects are managed.
Since this is not a written book you cannot see how the characters are portrayed  in such great dimension, this would be provided by the actors on stage.  This being said here are my opinions.
First of all there are two protagonist groups Harry's and his son and best friend.
With regard to Albus, not enough of his life before Hogwarts is discussed, so how he turns out prior to the beginning of the script is only insinuated in later scenes. Thus, while Harry had a few points in his favor before he spoke a word in the first book, Albus starts in the negative and goes lower before proceeding to redemption.  This is mirrored in Harry's path through this story as well.
Whereas books 1-7 had fully developed scenes from daily life with hints at later chapters at the beginning, this story had snippets.  Only when the main arc begins does the story feel fleshed out.
The main arc involves the use of a magical artifact introduced in book 3, and it's results read like a episode of Dr. Who, but allow it's protagonists to mature.
The culminating scenes, while full, were less satisfying than prior books(eg. The chamber and Riddle, Sirius' escape, the graveyard, etc).
The antagonist seemed to be a macguffin destined to mimic the Potter men's issue instead of a true villain.

While it seems I'm being very negative and my review I must now explain why I gave it four stars.  The story reads like a play that was based on a movie that was based on a book.  If you are a potter fan you can fill in most of the blanks and see the wizard world we fell in love with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_474?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=474&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

It is spectacular to a highly magical degree, and as I live too far from New York City to ever hope to see the play live, I am immensely grateful that the official script is available to buy online. Thank you so much, J. K. Rowling, for allowing people such as myself to experience the magic without having to travel great distances and pay money for tickets we may never be able to afford to see Cursed Child performed live on stage. Who knows? Maybe someday they'll make it a movie, or something more accessible, but for the meantime, I am very happy with the script and my own imagination, fueled by my never-ending adoration for J. K.

But if you are reading this review i doubt you are like them then.

1. It's a script for a play.  Its cearly not even the working script because there is no stage direction as all.  just a blip here and there about where they are.  It's all dialog.

2. the plot is written like a 90s reunion episode for your favorite 80's sitcom family.  They went out of their way to have people that shouldn't be in the HP universe 20 years in future pop in for a cameo. The Dialog is MUCH better than what you find in those tv events.

3. 40 years olds are kind of lame and have flaws.

The dialog is a bit corny, as plays tend to be. They don't have the luxury of movie closeups and have to be oddly descriptive in dialog.

It's a good story and I imagined it on a stage as I read it, which is the main reason I think I enjoyed it so much. It added a new layer to the life of Harry Potter and gave excellent context for the lives of the characters after the last book.

Part 2 was far more exciting than part 1, but both were very enjoyable.

There are 2 reasons why I knocked it down a star...

1. There's a contradiction with the last book on Harry's scar.
2. Ron's character feels... Off... From how he was portrayed in the books.

Aside from those 2 things, I highly recommend this to any Potter fan but I urge you all to remember that this is a play, not a full book, and to keep that in mind as you go through it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

In some ways I grew up through the lens of Harry. This play was the perfect culmination of nostalgia and life nuggets all wrapped into a beautifully written manuscript.

Day","""Harry Potter"" forever!","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2016","I am spoiled by the depth and characterizations in all the other ""Harry Potter"" books and the beautiful renditions of the movies. I'm sure the play itself would be fun to see..The story line is good and some of it is compelling and easily visualized. I was frustrated by the characterization of Ron as a grown imbecile when he had been coming into his own at the end of the original story. This also left Hermione cold and more aloof than I desired. The stage direction seemed bleak in comparison to the richness of interactions of the characters in the movies  and that they were so faithful to the written words . Perhaps the fact that it is only a script is what has provoked my disappointment, But I'm glad that I purchased and read this new work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_247?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=247&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I hope I get an opportunity to see it as it's meant to be.

 As for all the bad comments about the plot, no, it wasn't the best story in the world. It definitely doesn't live up to the magic of Rowling's seven book series, but you know what, I don't care. It was so much fun to be able to escape into this world again for the telling of a new story. This world was my childhood and teenage years, and now, as a man of nearly 30, I'm still proud to be a Potterhead, and I'm so thankful that we got this glimpse into what the future holds for those witches and wizards we love so much.

I can't wait for the definitive edition to come out, when I will a physical copy on my shelf right next to Deathly Hallows.

The usual Harry Potter plot line is they are all at home about to go to the Hogwarts express (Harry's children this time).  Something a little odd happens before they go.  They arrive at Kings Cross go through the border get on the train say goodbye to everyone. They all talk on the train meet people arrive at Hogwarts meet Hagrid if their first years.  Then they're all sorted into their houses they all have a big feast the headmaster make a speech and they all go and sleep.  Suspicious things start to happen the new trio which in this case would be Albus Severus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, and Rose Weasley  go and try to save the day. Get in trouble all along the way but end up saving Hogwarts. In this book this whole book extends over 4 school years and Rose Weasley is barely in.  But if you do want to see an adventure this might be for you. Some characters disappointingly were not in the book. People such as Luna Lovegood, Teddy Lupin, Victoria  Weasley,  Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley, Seamus Finnegan, Dean Thomas, George Weasley, Bill Weasley, Fleur Delacour, and many others. Neville Longbottom was included but he never actually spoke.  I mean I like the book but it wasn't quite Harry Potter it was not as exciting as it was to read the other ones. You still should buy the book no it's not quite hairy Potter but everyone knows you're anxious to read it. So do because I still like the book and when they no longer sell this version I can say I have it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

1) that it wouldn't live up to the Harry Potter name and
2) that it would live up to the Harry Potter name and I would go right back into the Potter withdrawal so many of us went through after Deathly Hallows.
I was right about the second reason. This was a truly beautiful tale with more twists and turns than I thought were possible in a story this length. My only recommendation is that if you are not familiar with reading scripts it could make the script a bit more difficult to follow.

Please if you are a Harry Potter fan disregard all of the negative reviews.  And here's why:

Many of the reviewers have failed to realize that this is a story about the relation between Harry and one of his sons.  More to the point it captures what it is like living in the shadow of a famous hero.  Giving the title of the screen play I think that that should be understood.

You will also see the development of some of the original cast, but again the story isn't about the original cast it's a whole new story line with a new set of characters.

If you are looking for the original cast go back and read the old books.  This is for those who expect to see a difference in characters because no one is the same after 19 years.  With that said don't expect Harry to be the same boy he was who killed Voldemort.  Don't expect Malfoy to be the same egotistical boy who hated muggles.

With that said I hope everyone who loves the Harry Potter books as much as I do give this book a chance because it is good and truly unique.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's, as usual, a complex, character-driven story, with lots of surprising twists and turns. The theatrical medium is essentially different -- everything is handled through dialogue, stage action, and scenery (which is described in the text, but not seen). Rowling collaborated, but the characters and ideas were still clearly hers.

The consequences of the kids' actions were dire and interesting. Her work follows through on its premises and goes places that, traditionally, children's fiction wouldn't go. It is that willingness and imagination that puts her work  consistently in the realm of greatness. Fantasy, at its best, ask big questions and provides big answers that can be profound, in the right hands. Rowling's Potter series has so far always delivered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Get this fact through your head first before purchasing and expecting the same phenomenon we had with the books that were written by her. I was so intrigued to see how one of the outcomes could be for life for all the characters from Harrys life and how it turned out to be put into a play. Overall it was great. I had 0 complaints, the plot was cheeky, had unexpected turns, and its very nice and warming inside to see life after Harry and Hogwarts for all of our favorite characters. Especially reading about everyone's kids and how they are all to continue on to hogwarts and how they all cope and which adventures they run into. Ofcourse id love to see JK Rowlings actual Adaptation of life for all the characters after ther books but we all know that, that wont happen because it just isnt right. Nevertheless this was a nice distraction, a nice reminder why im so obsessed with the wizarding world of Harry Potter and it was a nice plot.

Story started out rough in my opinion because it was difficult to see the characters I grew up with in these new roles. That said, I couldn't stop reading, finishing same day.

The Potter-esque magic, storyline and heart-lifting message that captured my loyalty in prior years started to pick up mid-way and finished strong leaving me happy I read the book and even hopeful for another one to come out (even if it is another screenplay).

I did drop one star because of the screenplay medium versus a novel. Though I realize a screen play is meant to put on a show, which I'm sure was decent (special effects in Potter can't be under-valued); by mass-printing the screen play Rowling and team must have realize that more people would read the play rather than go see the production, so why use a medium (screen play) that doesn't fully utilize language to provide the depth and even the edification that a novel does?  In my opinion this left the story lacking some depth and does its readers (especially the younger ones) a disservice through decreased literary exposure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_328?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=328&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It was difficult for me to get used to the play script format with the names on the sides before the lines, and I kept forgetting who was who with the original names being assigned to different characters. So after I had read it I still did not have a clear cast of characters envisioned in my mind.

I would like to read a story line where Harry launches into a search for the basis of the magic power that he and others possess and explore the foundations and source of the that power with the accompanying dangers of dealing with raw power and exposing the truth behind its existence.

Harry Potter and The Cursed Child - the most awaited book play script of the year, is storming the book world (2 million copies sold in the first 2days) and is making fans around the world giddy with excitement to be finally reading a new Harry Potter book.

Needless to say, I was no exception. Which is why, before I started reading this book, I tried to keep my expectations on a realistic level (tried is the operative word here), especially considering J.K.Rowling hadn't written this one.

Though I must say, that I was also a little nervous, because this series was magical perfection in my eyes, and I couldn't imagine how this play script could top that. In fact, without Rowling, I was sure of this being a step down; which is probably why, I am not as disappointed with it as many of the others are.

What is Harry Potter and The Cursed Child all about?

It's marketed as the 8th Harry Potter book, and that, I must say, is only partly accurate. Or at-least it depends on one's perception.

It's very much a continuation of the original story. In fact, it starts right where the epilogue ends - with Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermoine dropping off their kids at Platform 9 and 3/4. So, in that sense, yes, it's the 8th story.

But there is also a disconnect, which makes it unfair to call this the 8th of the Harry Potter series. It doesn't have the multi-faceted narrative, the strong characterization; and while it puts a grin on your face, it's incapable of evoking the depth of feeling the earlier books were able to arouse with ease.

Of-course most of this is because it's a play-script. And not a book. Which is why, I am not taking any points off for this.

I am only mentioning this, in the hopes that people keep this in mind, as they start reading the book. Because I have read too many negative reviews of this book, on the grounds that it is a play script. I mean, it's written right on the cover. What part of that was not clear?

Yes, I wished for this to be a book. And I wished that it would have been written by Rowling. But it's a play script, and I am not going to judge a thing adversely because it was something that it expressly claimed to be.

Of-course, being a play script doesn't excuse every thing (and I will get to those things later in the post).

It will make you see what you choose today make what you are tomorrow as well as why your past is important. I think the characters are on-dimensional because it's written as a play.

Mischief Managed.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","For a play, I thought this was a worthy edition to the Potter canon. But it’s not great like the books and it’s not written by J.K.Rowling, so it shouldn’t be judged as such. The epilogue of The Deathly Hallows serves as the jumping off point to the story. What could be more appropriate and welcome?  The adventure centers around Albus, the estranged son of Harry, and Scorpius Malfoy who, after both are sorted into Slytherin, become close friends. In a misbegotten effort to prevent the death of Cedric Diggory, by the use of a forbidden and illegal time turner, they rain down disaster and darkness on the Wizarding World and their own families.  Lots of scenes from the original 7 books are revisited and we are treated to some alternate realities in which, for one, <spoiler>Ron and Hermione never fall in love and get married and Harry Potter is killed by Voldemort. </spoiler>It’s not nice to try to change history.  It has somewhat of an “It’s a Wonderful Life” vibe in places.  Some of the ways the boys unintentionally change history are overly fanciful and fan fictiony, but the script fits in. Potterheads  should not be outraged, and I was not disappointed. There are lots of cameo appearances by many beloved and hated characters from the books and movies, and I believe it when I read what a crowd and critic pleaser the actual West end play is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_466?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=466&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

The play script was easy to read making it easy to follow along.  Second, even though the script's story-line is a collaboration between 3 authors and not just JK Rowling, I still thought it was an entertaining read.  Third, this book is less about magic and more about the relationships between the characters.  But it wouldn't be a Harry Potter book if there isn't at least a magical adventure; in this case, with the time-turners.  Because time-turners are involved, of course this script is going to hash over previous events from previous books.  Forth, this book follows Harry Potter's son, not Harry Potter.  Given the format, story-line, multiple authors, and point-of-view, this book will have a different feel from the rest.  I took a star off because I would have preferred a longer book in novel format with more details.  The script was too short.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

After reading the script book for the new play I felt in some ways of going to a family reunion. It was wonderful to see what my favorite Witches and Wizards have been doing over the last 19 years since the last book.

Harry’s son Albus Severus Potter and Draco Malfoy’s son Scorpius have become friends and are brought into an adventure. The chemistry between the two characters is as touching and family feeling as is Harry and Ron. I enjoyed the story that has father and son issues and helps the characters see and heal each other’s pains.

Unlike other Harry Potter book covers that have a meaning to the story. The logo of a boy in what appears to be a snitch made out of a bird nest is somewhat confusing to me. However, after reading the story I believe Albus Potter is the cursed child.

I enjoyed this story after such a long time of missing Harry and the gang. So now I’m even more excited for the new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Bringing back beloved characters from the Harry Potter septology, and expounding upon briefly mentioned or entirely new ones, with all the wonders of magic and wizardry, this is a worthy addition to any HP fan's shelf.  However, the story felt a bit 'tacked on' - squeezing another drop from the septology's plot, a bit contrived in its twists and turns.  I do quite like the ambiguous title and the sense of mystery throughout; how does the title apply?  Who is it referring to?  In the end, it's still nicely unclear, with more obvious candidates and more subtle suggestions.  Another thing that bothered me, however, is that the returning characters seemed rather.. out of character.  Typical speech habits, patterns of behavior, and even seeming personality traits have been lost or replaced.  This may be a side effect of the story being told pretty much entirely through dialogue, but none of the characters feel fully developed by the end, and the whole thing felt rather like fluff, like decently written fanfiction rather than Rowling's usual intense style (though of course she was not the sole author of the script).  I did find myself rather amused by the occasional descriptions of characters' behaviors, and bemused by descriptions of magic performed or experienced, wondering how on earth they managed to pull that off on stage.  Perhaps someday a video recording of the play performance will be released, and the story will feel a lot more immersive taken in its intended format.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It really was everything I wanted it to be.

Characters were spot on. Were they slightly different from the original stories? Yes, because people grow. I thought all of the characters stayed true to themselves but we're who they could and should be as adults. It would have been easy, especially with Draco, to make anyone a black and white character... Who they were as a child, or now a totally new person. The authors balanced this well.

This really is a play, though. You have to read it as a play (or picture the movie). I could see where a few things were staged in order to make it possible to happen on a stage, but that did not deter my enjoyment at all. There was not as much detail as the book, but then the movies did not have that either. As I said, I read it as a movie or play in my mind.

I would love to read more of these further adventures, but sadly, I doubt I will be able to. Rowling has said this is the end, but she has said that before.

Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","Based on the other reviews, I was very hesitant to read the book and opened it, already thinking negatively about it.  I stopped and reminded myself that 1) I didn't expect it to be written by J.K. Rowling; 2) I didn't expect it to be like the other books, or a continuation of the other books; 3) I didn't expect anything in relation to who or how the characters would be.  After all, the last time we saw them they were what 18?  Now they're nearing 40, married, parents, holding jobs that their own parents held/would have held.

I picked up the book again and started over with no expectations.  It was fun to read.  I loved the references to the other stories, seeing Aunt Petunia in just a slightly different light, Draco actually loving someone, Harry stumbling through life as he always does, getting lucky here and there, having a great support system in his friends.

It's all there.  Everything we always loved is there, it's just different now.  As, maybe, it should be.  The ending had me in tears.  Probably the last 20 or so pages had me on the verge of tears.  A lot of growing up on those pages, and a lot of love for the series sprinkled throughout this book.  I think it was respectful of the original, and allowed us to say ""Hello"" again to some characters we love, and remember the painful ""Goodbye"" we had to say to a few.

I feel that the people giving it 1 star did so with the thinking that this should have been another Harry Potter book.  It was more than that.  It was a tribute to J.K. Rowling's work, and lovely homage to the characters she brought into our lives and homes for so many years.

Happy reading!  Don't expect it to be something it isn't, and you won't be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_94?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=94&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Wow.

Wow!

I don't want to talk too much about anything because JK Rowling is asking everyone to #KeepTheSecrets, but I guess that's why they make (view spoiler) so I'll do my best to avoid writing about anything specific (and when I do have to go into details, I'll just use the spoiler tags). You're warned. (Quick note to app users—apparently the spoiler tag doesn't work in the app. If you didn't have to click to see the all caps ""spoiler tag"" above, maybe don't proceed unless you've read the book.

I haven't read the Harry Potter series since I've joined Goodreads, so I don't have any reviews or official rankings of them. I've always said Goblet of Fire was my favorite book, although all of them are probably 5* (perhaps I'll reread the series next year!). I enjoyed reading Tales of the Beedle Bard when it came out and I'm always ready for anything Jo wants to give us from the wizarding world (although I did quickly get bored of Pottermore—perhaps it was the slow rollout of content).

I flew through this book in a little over 24 hours. Not too surprising given that it's a play (340 pages of script are a lot easier to read than 340 pages of a novel), but it did feel good to simply devour more Harry Potter fiction. It was great revisiting the characters I fell in love with so many years ago and meeting new characters Rowling created. (I think it's important to point out that the play, as far as I can tell, was written by Jack Thorne and was based on a story created by Thorne, Rowling, and the director, John Tiffany. If I had to guess, the overall outline of what happened/who was introduced was all Jo [her world after all] with some creative additions from Thorne & Tiffany, but the actual acts and scenes and lines are all Thorne.)

What amazed me most of all is how what I read was actually happening right now on a stage in London. I've read plenty of scripts that require a fantastic director to put up (e.g. The 39 Steps & Peter and the Starcatcher—both of which I read after seeing them on stage) but this probably tops them all. It should come as no surprise that the Production Credits list someone as in charge of Illusions & Magic. But still, even simple bits like (view spoiler) are eclipsed by descriptions of (view spoiler), (view spoiler) or (view spoiler). I mean, HOW?! I really want to go to London just to see this on stage.

But I think it would excel more as a magical play than it does as a script. The story was interesting (view spoiler) and it was great to go back to Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, but it still didn't quite click. (view spoiler) It feels like a cheat to introduce a new type of magic that felt similar to an old type but without explaining all of its differences. Also, there were plenty of times characters did or said things that felt so out of character. For instance, (view spoiler) and grown-up Ron felt like he was just trying too hard to fill Fred's shoes.

There also felt like there were some plot holes with what I remember from the previous seven novels. Perhaps things changed after Voldemort was defeated in Deathly Hallows but wasn't (view spoiler)

In the end, the play feels a little too much like fan fiction and not enough like a Rowling addition to the series. I actually now wonder how much approval she had to give and how much Thorne & Tiffany came up with on their own. It was great seeing old characters again but everything felt a little too convenient (especially this HUGEST of spoilers: (view spoiler) Seriously, WTF?!). But, I still flew through the book and I'm sure the play is amazing to watch... If I could give this 3.5* I would, but for now, I'm rounding up because it was still a lot of fun to read despite its problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I definitely enjoyed reading it, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. I loved reading Rowling's style and delving into the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends, but it just didn't flow as easily as the other books in the series did. The characters also seemed a bit off and a little one-dimensional compared to the rest of the series. Perhaps it's because we only had one volume to get to know the characters as opposed to the seven in the original series? Perhaps it was the format of a script rather than the traditional novel? Perhaps there was too much hype about the fact that there was another book in the series? I'm not sure.

All the characters from original books were part of this play.  With that said this is not a story told in the normal book reading way.  Which I have never read a story in play form before but once I started reading I was caught up in the story so much I didn't notice the difference just wanted to know what was going to happen next.  I would love to see this play and see how they do the things munched in the book.  It seems that at times the play comes out into, over and around the audience it would be so magical to be a part of that.  With all this said I'm NOT GOING TO BE A SPOILER!!!!!

PROS - it was a quick fun read, fun bonus bits for HP fans, new characters CONS - too short (could just be me wanting more), kind of weird storyline, where a typical HP book would talk about in a chapters worth is condensed into one page in Cursed Child.

If you read the script from the first episode of the television show ER, I guess you may find yourself stunned by how ""not good"" it is. But when you watch those words come to life with acting and sets, it's a different story.

I did enjoy getting a glimpse of the next generation of wizards and witches in the magical world of Harry Potter. This book would be confusing and frustrating to read for those unfamiliar with the other books and films because it implies and references past storylines.

I would love to see this come to life so I hope the play will be in the states one day. Thanks, J.K. Rowling, for giving us a little something to scratch that itch we get from missing this very magical world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling demonstrates an impressive ability to bring her magical world vividly to the imagination of her audience. I also expect that it makes an excellent play that I hope someday to be able to see. This  was a fine book and a good play. However, it was disappointing as a new installment of the Harry Potter Saga. Now, it is hard to fault Rawling for this, as my objection really boils down to her previous work simply being TOO good. It would be hard for any book, much less a play, to hold up to my expectations and unfortunately this play did not.

Below are some of my concerns, to name but a few <Spoilers from here on out>:

The utilization of the time turner trope, unsurprisingly, opens up a large number of plot holes (how do the effects of manipulating the blanket propagate forward without other effects, like there being an Albus and Scorpius or Delphi's machinations; why can't someone at any point in the future make a new unlimited time turner and render all futures unfixed etc.).

Many of the portrayals of characters are disappointing to those of us who grew up with them (the idea that counterfactually Diggory could become a death eater, that Professor Longbottom would not have a more active role at Hogwarts in dealing with the situation, that Harry's scar could start hurting (despite the Horcrux in him being destroyed) is deeply implausible).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Albus Potter is a wonderful character, as is Scorpio Malfoy, and the ways these characters echo and also change the stories of their parents is a delight.

In ways that I don't want to spoil it does revisit old territory, which is not what I expected. But the choices that lead to those moments are very strong. This is a story about children dealing with living in the shadow of their parents' histories (and their parents struggling to deal with the same thing). It's rich terrain.

I suspect some readers will find certain big character moments towards the end a little less satisfying, in large part because this is not a book, where everything gets spelled out on the page, but a script. There's a lot of magic in these pages, but there's undoubtedly far more on the stage.

With the publication of the script Rowling announced she doesn't expect to return to the story of Harry Potter again. While I understand her decision, I hope she'll consider more stories about Albus, Scorpio (and also Delphi, Rose, James, Lily and all the rest). She and her co-writers have added a lot of interesting toys in this latter-day wizard world that we barely get to play with.

Last note -- loved every Ron moment. He's only gotten more fun as a character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I miss J K Rowling's writing, yet, for the most part I enjoyed the play. I wish I could have gotten to know more of the characters; all of the children. I think there would be more depth if there was a novel written. I would enjoy delving into the characters more.
It was nice to visit most of the characters I love from the books. I did not find Harry full of angst; I enjoyed that he was a caring if a bit neurotic dad at times. I enjoyed seeing a new side to Draco- people do change. I enjoyed the time travel and thought the play was creative. I would like to see the play or a movie. I would love to read another Harry Potter novel and be able to revisit all the main characters in the book.
By the end the play ended too quickly for me! I liked what I read and would have liked more...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"". (Parts One and Two). Rehearsal Edition

Being a skeptic about sequels I ordered this book mainly because I am a closet Harry Potter ""groupie"".  Yes, I read the books in my 50's and have ""Pottermore"" on my computer favorites!

Besides being a ""sequel"" the book is presented in script form, written as a read through and directive for scene settings of a play.  How can any of those things compare to the addicting words and characters of J.K. Rowling?

Well, it hit the mark for my unquenchable thirst for continuing the saga of Hogworts and it's favored alumni.  I felt an immediate connection to Harry's, Hermione's and Draco Malfoy's children.  The story of Albus and Scorpius had a more contemporary feel but I loved the fact that the old favorites were included and given some closure.  It took no more than a chapter to adjust to the literary structure and from there my mind assimilated the words easily and went into picture mode.  I loved the story and the characters and felt a seamless continuation of the original series.

My only lingering thought is:  ""How will this go over as a live stage presentation?""  A movie?  Sure.  But a live stage may be a difficult venue to keep the drama and electric charge alive without the special effects.  Although I will be in line for a ticket if it comes to a venue near me!

You immediately see Rowling's engaging writing and development of the new characters.  I am sure Thorne and Tiffany made the way easy for adaptation to play format.  Their biographies show their success in that venue.  All should be proud of this addition to the Potter family of books!  HP fans...definitely pick this up!

Liang","It's a screen play.","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2016","I don't know Jack Thorne's work, so I can't say if this is how he presents his plays. I don't know how much of a hand or say Rowling had in this production and the screen writing.

I understand the frustration with this novel and the plausibility of many things and how it all connects together with the 8 novels.

First, don't read this as a regular piece of literature. This is a screen play. These are scripts, lines for the players, so I read it as so. Scripts can't be read the same as literature. Example: look at how many times Hamlet had been remade and portrayed differently each time. One line can be repeated several ways and the effect will be different each time.

Second, time has passed. Harry and everyone are no longer teens. They are adults, parents who have kids, and they are working. So yes, I expected them to change in some way. Did I expect Harry to be a good parent? No, he never had stability in his life. And I think they tried to show that in his parenting skills or lack of.

Third, This is the Magical world. And right when we think we know the world, another thing pops up and suddenly we question it and try to see how it fits into the magical world. Yes, poly juice potion takes a while to make, but this is a screen play! Think of it like a movie? The protagonist will some how have the key/answer/solution and they somehow have what they need to make everything right again. So yea, this screenplay does fit into the cliches of movies.

And seriously? Humiliation to an extent could change Diggory. But becoming a Death Eater? Sure, we just don't know how bad the humiliation was to him and the effects of it to know how he became one. There are several gaps in this play because of the ever changing universes, and it seems we have to fill in those gaps and attempt to understand how a character changed. Isn't that part of screen plays?

But really though, Delphi's parents? I'm still trying to manage that. Although, her name did give away her role as an oracle/prophecy from the beginning... And we know that's bad news.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

For those who have never read a script before, that could present a bit of a challenge.  The story is in the dialogue and not all the other elements (from simple to detailed) that a story on a page may include.  A glimpse into the set and the staging help bring things to life if you have some theater or scipt reading experience, but may be distracting if you don't.  With that caviet, I did find the tale quite enjoyable.

This book is about Harry Potter as a grown up. Also its more about his child finding his own way and trying to make his own identity without being under the shadow of ""the boy who lived"".  Everyone is saying what they think Harry Potter would do as an adult but often times we make different decisions as adults than we would when we were children to protect our kids. Sometimes as adults we forget what truly matters and I think that happened to Harry. I think the plot was good. I admit the Slytherin thing was a shocker but I think its a little true to how life would be. In life everything doesn't happen as we expect it but in the unexpected great things can emerge. Like the other books it kept me guessing and wanting to know more and then the unexpected twist. Its what a J.K Rowling book is expected to be and was. It didn't have all the turns and twists of the other books, however it was still captivating. All in all it got my husband interesting in reading the other books now. That's one of the best thing about a Harry Potter book, the fact that it can suck you in without you realizing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_445?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=445&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

It's interesting to see how the children have adapted to the legacy of their parents. I'm glad J.K. decided to make the story available to those of us unable to attend the play in London.

However the book did not seem to have that much plot development. Most of the Harry Potter books in the series have plot twists and well developed characters.

Whereas I would have devoured a novel, it took me several days to work my way through this.  Would much prefer that this story is put into novel form.  Also now understand that this book is the rehearsal edition and a ""final"" script will be published probably next year with the changes made to the rehearsal edition.  I, for one, do not plan on buying another copy just because of some modifications.  If you have not purchased this book but are thinking about doing so, it might be something to consider.

So if that's what you were expecting you will be disappointed. In addition, it tends to violate some aspects of the HP canon and unlike each HP book, it does not introduce any interesting magical or cultural aspect of the HP world to the reader.

Having said that, the story itself is quite interesting and really compelling in the 2nd half. I would recommend this as an interesting read on its own.

I am not quite finished with the book but it has not been a let down at all. I just wish that it wasn't the last one. J. K. Rowling said that Harry Potter is done and that there will be no more. Hopefully, she will write books about the kids and Harry and Ginny, and Ron and Hermonie. If you were missing Harry Potter since completing the original series years ago, you definitely need to pick this book up and read it. Just an FYI, this does not read as a book, why you might ask, because it is the actual screen play of the play that was released in Europe earlier this year. IT IS FANTASTIC though.

When I first heard about a ""new"" Harry Potter book, of course I went crazy about it. But when I discovered it was some kind of script, I was not so crazy about it anymore. Afterwards, a lot of friends who read it recommended the reading. Even so I was incertain about the book. Anyways, I finally bought it and read it in no time. And, even though the book have a very interesting story, it's not Harry Potter style at all. It was not written by J.K Rowling and yes, it is a play's script, which means it's a very straightforward narrative. The lack of details and descriptions made me not fall in love with this book. It coud be an amazing story if written by J.K. Rowling, but as it is, it's not.

Yes some of the situations have little development.  Yes they could not quite figure out how to get Ron involved in a satisfying way. Yes this is made for theater.  The best way to enjoy this book is imagining it being played out on stage.  The fact is, it was not made for readers so you are not going to get the same feel you did for the last 7 stories.  Personally, it was very nostalgic to revisit Hogwarts and these characters I loved.  I never felt like Malfoy had a satisfying ending or the redeeming moment that he deserved, so I loved that we kind of see that through his nerdy, incredibly adorable son.  If I am in West End and manage to get tickets, I would love to see this play out.  If WB makes a movie, I will watch it.  This can be enjoyable if you have the proper mindset.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A+++

I’m not just saying that as a fanboy because JkR didn’t even write this book.
I loved it because it perfectly reflected my own life of trying to make my parents proud.  Then when that doesn’t work just as with albus  I would work hard at trying to fix broken things to only make them worse to trying again and making them go even more worse to the point that life becomes like black horrifying pit of hell.  This is what happened to Albus and is exactly how my own life played out. And just when you think the horribleness is over it only gets harder. But through these trials we become stronger and wiser and we learn that being skilled at something,  having lots of money or romantic love none of that really matters. It’s nice, sure but none of it matters. The thing that we must set our focus on far exceedingly more than those trivial things is friendship. That is where true strength lies. With friendship nothing is out of reach. Everything is achievable if we place friendship as priority one.

I never thought that would happen again and for that I am grateful. Overall, I'm glad I read the screenplay. I had heard many not-so-good reviews of the book and decided to go into it as blindly as possible. I was able to avoid any spoilers and was very aware that this was a screenplay and not a book and that it wouldn't be the same as a Harry Potter book, and that helped me to enjoy it more and just take it for what it is: another new Harry Potter experience.

HP8 is not perfect. The writing is often quite flat and SO FAR from J.K. Rowling's voice that at times the characters don't even feel like themselves (I'm looking at you, Ron...). It is largely plot and action based, and I'm sure the actors would bring so much more life into the script when performed, but to read it certainly felt unauthentic at times.

Where the old characters fall a bit flat, the new ones shine. Albus and Scorpius have an enviable friendship. It was interesting to see the children of two arch-enemies become best friends, completely disregarding their fathers' opinions of the other family. It was also interesting to see Hogwarts through the eyes of an unpopular boy who wasn't particularly good at magic or Quidditch. Albus' experience at school was the complete opposite of Harry's and, in my opinion, made Hogwarts feel a little bit more realistic.

I loved the theme of family in this book. It was so satisfying to see our trio happy with families of their own and jobs that were actually perfect for them. Regardless of how I felt about the actual choice of storyline, the writing style, or anything else, I still loved the book because it was another chance to be immersed in the wizarding world without knowing what happens next, and that is a rare thing that I haven't had the privilege of experiencing for many years.

Harry Potter is and always will be my first true love when it comes to books. The original Harry Potter books inspired and engrossed me like nothing has since, and have proved themselves to endure as phenomenal works for nearly my whole life.

I remember being six or seven years old and my mom purchased Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to read aloud to me at night before bed. As they came out, I checked out the next books at the library and devoured them. I became obsessed with the series -- I had SO MUCH HP merch back in the day. Shirts, a backpack, decorations for my room, a clock, video games, literally everything. I had my mom pre-order the new books for me and waited at the front door for UPS to show up. I attended midnight releases of the books and movies as I got older. I literally grew up alongside Harry Potter and I am so grateful for those wonderful experiences, and I will continue to be grateful for any little extension of that world that I might get.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK, I RECOMMEND STOPPING HERE.

It was absolutely heartbreaking to read about Albus' trials during the first part of the book. I felt so sad for him to feel so lonely and useless at Hogwarts. I hated that he felt like a disappointment to Harry for being sorted into Slytherin. I wanted to help Albus and Harry to connect with each other and for Harry to be able to help Albus with his demons.

I was terrified during the portion of the time travel when Albus and Scorpius discover the alternate reality where Voldemort is ruler. I had never considered that alternative -- that Voldemort was victorious during the Battle of Hogwarts, that he killed Harry and prevailed to lead the wizarding world into darkness. I'm glad it was a short piece of the book because it was so horrible, but it was interesting to consider and also put into perspective a bit more that weight of Harry's greatness that Albus felt he had to live up to.

The back and forth time travel got a bit tiresome at times, but I did not see the twist with Delphi coming AT ALL. I love when I can be surprised by a twist or turn in a book and certainly was here, although thinking about Voldemort's and Bellatrix's daughter is pretty disgusting. It's very interesting that J.K. Rowling decided to make that canon.

One last thing -- THANK YOU to J.K. Rowling for making Hermione Minister of Magic! I could not believe what I had read when that was revealed and was SO PROUD of my frizzy-haired girl for coming so far. Hermione was the first character I remember ever truly LOVING and identifying with and it was so wonderful to see her turn out to be everything she deserved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I enjoyed every minute of it and this book has given the closure that I feel was needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

However as that wasn't going to happen, it is still really good.  They did a good job of picking up on important threads from book 7, but I won't say anymore as I want to avoid any spoilers.  If you're a die hard fan of the original series, you have to accept that this is continuing the story from a different lens.  Having said that, it is definitely worth reading and enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_367?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=367&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2016","Here's the deal: I liked this.

I think a lot of us uber fans have to reconcile the fact that we can like something a lot without worshiping it in the manner we may have worshipped the original.

It's a great story, and I had missed these characters so much, so much that I didn't even realize how much so until I heard Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dumbledore, Snape....and Harry speak again.

You cannot understand this play without being a super fan, as there are memories and allusions and hints that you must infer, or they go unexplained.

I respected this. An ode to the super fan....and a glimpse at the future we all imagined when we turned the last page of book seven.

This book may be far from what you imagined and you may hate it...and it doesn't radiate with the charm and language and color of Rowlings' novels, but it made me happy. I got to visit old friends.

I think that's the point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Give it a chance.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","It is important to note that this is a SCRIPT, not a novel. Given that, this SCRIPT is good. I enjoyed reading it and being back in the wizarding world, knowing that all the characters I have loved for years are okay and still up to no good-- even their children. It was a fun read.
It is also important to note that our dear JK Rowling is not the sole author, as she was in the original 7 books. There are two other authors who contributed and, most likely, Rowling just approved and edited the final story. Knowing this, it is easier to accept that this is very different compared to the original 7 books.
I do have issues with certain aspects of the book and think that, in some instances, it boiled down to pure convenience, not logic. That, however, is not enough to make me dislike this script and regret having read it. I absolutely loved it.
I suggest reading it for yourself to form your own opinion but I believe that many fans are being too harsh on it, given the important notes I listed above.
The main thing I had issues with was how long it took Amazon to ship and deliver this book. I pre-ordered Cursed Child months ago expecting to have the book arrive on my doorstep on July 31 only to be disappointed and forced to wait until August 3 to receive it. I could have understood delivering on August 1 since the 31 was a Sunday, but the 3rd was a little much. I am not likely to ever pre-order a book from Amazon again because of this (and Target had a better deal-- $17.99 for the book and a free poster with book purchase).
Overall, this was a fun read and offered a great amount of closure for myself and the left over feelings I had after finishing Hallows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_235?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=235&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Its plot is engaging but light & sentimental the way visiting the theme park must be. It is a script, of course, which means we're missing at least half the storytelling that we would see on the stage.  The Harry Potter universe is a comfortable place to live in again, but I can't imagine one trying to understand it without having read the books;  it seems like all the requisite explanations are there;  again, I think the art is in the stage production.  Although it approaches being derivative, the play almost counts on your expecting what's next to come. This isn't Doctor Who,  though, in which of late all the old villains seem to pop up, for no particular reason, paving over their previous selves.  In fact, my favorite character, without saying too much, is Draco Malfoy. He is wonderfully-rendered to play on and against our expectations. It is almost his story.  Certainly, no one has a better vantage point on the major theme of fathers and sons.  Reading Shakespeare to ourselves, we are always taught to create a theater of the mind. That's what has to happen here to appreciate this story as best as possible in script form. Otherwise, I'm waiting for the promised Broadway run, which will spawn a traveling performance that I'll be waiting at the station to welcome.

P.S. What's with all the hugging & outing of emotions. I'm American & I got squirmy. If Harry had spoken like this about his emotions, A- He would have received progressively harder chucks on the shoulder from Ron, & B- He would have been so emotionally-stable, the idea of running away from everyone & taking on Voldemort single-handedly would have been  impossible, end of story","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I had high hopes for this book but had also read many negative reviews. Having read it today I can tell you it is the worth reading. For me personally this story confirmed many theories I had about the plot and characters and also surprised me with many unexpected plot points. This is also a book of contradictions. While some characters are barely involved and remain very two dimensional, others are explored vividly and very well fleshed out. For me the biggest disappointment in the story was the main conflict which at times was redundant, predictable and a bit ridiculous. However, the relationship explored between Harry and his son Albus is what makes the book worth reading in my opinion, and is well explained. For many Harry Potter fans who have their own ideas of what happened after Dealthy Hallows you may be disappointed. However, if you read with an open mind I think for most this will be a great read and addition to the Harry Potter world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I enjoyed this book. I read it realizing it would be in script form, it is a play after all. I was also in the frame of mind that it would be like a fans story of Harry Potter, telling a story of what they would have imagined occurred after the 'nineteen years'. I did not expect another JK Rowlings book.
The story told in stage form was pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading about familiar names and thought the plot a good one. Although in my mid 60's I am an avid Harry Potter fan and remember shedding a tear when  Deathly Hallows2 showed in our local cinema. First time I have known the whole Cinema stand up and applause at the end of a movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's a script.  A lot of negative reviews complain that there's not enough detail.  You will not get a lot of character development or detail.  The actors on the stage would have to provide that.  Did you read any plays in school?  Shakespeare maybe?  Then see it acted out in a play?  Huge difference isn't it.

I liked it.  Didn't love it.  I thought it was a little gooey.  The plot did keep me on edge a few times, wondering how on earth everything could turn out okay, and where we were going next.

Not the greatest of Harry Potter story's, but an enjoyable read none the less. I feel time travel is a hard thing to get right, and they did get most of it right. I did notice a couple small things that seemed to be mistakes In the story though. Nothing to major, and I won't go into detail for fear of spoiling the ending. Since the mistakes if they are mistakes, and not misstakes in my memory happen in the end of the story. I would recommend Harry Potter fans read this, and I would love to see the show one day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Skimpy in detail, and loaded with theateresque, dramatic dialogue (which again, is what I was expecting). That being said, I think this script book told a good story. It took me about 4 hours to read, and I didn't want to put it down. If the average, diehard, HP fan reads this book with realistic expectations, I think he or she may find it enjoyable. The one thing I didn't like about this book is how rushed it was. And I couldn't help but think the whole time how awesome it would have been if JK were to make the cursed child into a 3 or 4 book series with all of the same magic that came with Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Because Jo was one of the writers, this is tied to the Harry Potter series and I have been reading these for the past 17 years, I had to purchase and read The Cursed Child. I agree with many other HP book fans that this play is more of a standalone entity than a continuation of the series. The characters aren't very true to themselves, however, it is great to learn a little more about the next generation and see some interesting explanations (that could be true) for the original seven books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Excellent Script!","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","I grew up the same age as Harry Potter in the books when they were released. Even after the final story, I had so many questions about the world JK Rowling created. This script provides a wonderful window into the past and future of Harry Potter for those who have grown up into adulthood alongside him and his friends.

This book is not a prose narrative however. It is a real script. I love screenplays and scripts as they open up your imagination in new ways that books and movies cannot. I definitely recommend reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_397?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=397&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I was thrilled and the idea of seeing what the Wizarding World had been up to since the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, but was terrified that this would become just another cash-in sequel like so many other franchises seem to do these days. I should have known better than to think Rowling would tarnish her creation by simply cashing in. What's been released is an exciting, well crafted extension of the original 7 novels that, in some ways, fixed some of the issues I had.

Without saying too much, I really loved this. It is not entirely perfect, but it is damn near close. The play format took a second to warm up to (I haven't read a play since college) but once I got up to speed, I felt like the format actually worked better than expected as it allows so much of the reader's own imagination to fill in the gaps that would otherwise be descriptions in a prose novel. Because of the play format, the pacing is a bit different than in previous stories, but again, it works quite well. The amount of story told between these covers is larger than I'd ever anticipated. And though the pacing maybe lend itself more towards theater, this is a Rowling story through and through. Do not worry that working with two other writers may have watered down the J.K.-ness of this tale. There is no question that this up to par.

I cannot wait for a full production of this to hit the States. With so much action, magic, heart, and visits from characters and locations both new and old, this is sure to be a hit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_99?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=99&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It takes a little time to get into the flow of the script.  Once you become used to the flow, the reading of the book goes quite quickly.  Because of the time needed for a well-timed play, there are some holes that would have been filled if this were an actual book.  J.K. Rowling would have filled the gaps that are there for the play, but since a play usually runs about two hours, it is not possible to fill all of the holes.  On point is J.K. Rowling indicated this would be the last of the Harry Potter books.  This play leaves one opening where Delphi will be sent to Azkaban.  We know that several witches/wizards have escaped from Azkaban over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

At the beginning, I had a little bit of a hard time getting used to it being a script. But very soon, I was sucked into the story... and the lives of the characters. It was sooooo good, and I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough, especially towards the end. Reading this makes me want to go back and re-read the whole entire series. A huge thank you to J.K. Rowling for taking us back into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

I knew that it was written in ...","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2016","I started into this book extremely skeptical.  I am an enormous Harry Potter fan, notorious for anxiously awaiting every previous book at their midnight release, devouring them all through the night and not sleeping until I completed them.  This book I never had that same anticipation for, which in retrospect was probably a good thing.  I knew that it was written in a play format, so that kind of made me leery.  But eventually I succumbed - I needed more of the Potterverse in my life!

So the book started off slowly and was honestly pretty corny.  It read a lot like the epilogue from HP7, if you understand what I mean.  About halfway through to book, it started developing and had some trademark Rowling twists and turns.  The little snippets of old characters that I missed so much made it completely worth the read.

My advice to you is to go into the book expecting it to be different from the previous books.  It is a very different format and therefore a very different read.  Lower your expectations - don't expect to have J.K. Rowling's intelligent flare for writing and skill of wit on every page, the way we have been used to in the past.  There will still be demonstrations of this in the stage direction and the dialogue, but it will be different.  With those expectations going into the read, I was thoroughly entertained and appreciative of this addition to the Harry Potter story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Love Kindle.  Have 5 of them because I am a Pastor, so I teach good to share.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2016","I am a Harry Potter fan, I know most people probably didn't like the layout of the book because it is in play format, one thing with me how my mind works, is weird.  I honestly never read a entire book until I picked up a Harry Potter book in High School.  Now I was in Theater all throughout HS. I am use to plays. So I really love reading it like this, because my brain already automatically read the books like this as characters talked anyway, this makes it more simple for me.  My mind creates what it would picture the character to look like, and then have the scene unravel in my head, and the characters talk as the story unfolds. I love this book.  DONT CONTINUE FOR THIS PART A SMALL SPOILER....  I didn't like the fact that it shows Harry's son as a bad kid but you kind of already got that from the title, and even before the book came out they were talking about that. I am not done with the book yet, almost but it is great.  Love it, I will never be sick of these books. I know a lot of people judge me because I am a Pastor, but It is just fantasy, and I do not put it above the Bible, so there is no problem there. I have a mentor center, and teach ministry, one thing I do love is that I have 5 kindles and that I have all my books on all my devices, so they can be read from all of them, my mom has one of mine right now reading another book.

Here I am again, reading another Harry Potter book (albeit in the form of a play), and I loved every second of it.

Secondly, I feel like the story had a nice balance between the three aforementioned characters and their children. I began to realize what Rowling et al. were trying to accomplish when there was mention of a specific device in the story. I don't think they would have been able to accomplish telling a successful story without it. 

Thirdly, it was nice to be reintroduced to certain characters, as if we the readers were paying our respects to them, as if it were our chance to say one last goodbye. It was bittersweet.

One theme that is pretty profound in the novel is the relationship between father and son; not only between Harry and Albus (biological), but other characters as well e.g., Harry and Dumbledore, whose love did not stem from a biological background, but from a special nurture that became a natural form of love.

I appreciate the messages that the authors set out to convey. I also appreciate the message of the  importance of relationships in life (friendship and family). These are two things in life that can easily be taken for granted, especially during these days when cell phones, texting, emails, etc. have taken the place of genuine human interactions. Sometimes I think we forget that spending time and having our family and friends know and see the real person for who we are (and not through texting) are what makes life more meaningful. The authors touched upon this very idea and I applaud and appreciate them for that. My 10 year old daughter is already re-reading the novel. I am glad that she gets to learn and respect what friends and family should really mean to her.

Highly recommend this last adventure of Harry Potter, his friends and his family for any Potterhead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_481?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=481&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I mean it was always going to be a play, but then I thought, who can blame anyone with the ridiculous promotion that encourages it. Even here on Goodreads it's described as Harry Potter 8!!!!

Plays are a lot different to read than books. Minimal description and often little direction. Shakespeare, it seems only managed one memorable one, ""Exit, pursued by bear"", but this actually reads really easily and well and at the end I really felt like I'd read a new chapter, even though it's in this form and would clearly be better seen on stage.

I look forward to seeing this in 2034 when it comes to Australia😀","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_484?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=484&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

The like or dislike of books is a personal thing.  However; ""Cursed Child"" is not just a revisit to the fanciful world of H. POTTER and friends but, an internal visit to each readers personal relationship with their parents or children and just how much unnecessary pressure we put on that relationship with our own expectations, of what we think their expectations may be.

I read this pretty quick, as I'm sure all the HP fans did!  The story is great, and being written as a screenplay it gives great visuals of the staging and scenes, similarly to a book but in a much quicker fashion.

This special edition of the script is highly readable and fits comfortably in the known universe of Harry Potter.  ""The Cursed Child"" takes place nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, as Harry and Ginny's teenage son Albus is finding it difficult to be the son of the Boy Who Lived.  Fortunately, Albus meets Scorpius, the son of Draco Malfoy, who has his own legacy challenges.  The two teenagers will become friends, and, as teenagers do, they will find trouble as well..

The story resurrects familiar characters and familiar elements from the Harry Potter series, along with time travel, an old enemy, a new threat, and a twisting and suspenseful storyline.  The final chapters are quite dramatic and a  special look at Harry Potter and his friends and family, now adults with families and jobs, but still very much the same people.  The book would be challenging to read without familiarity with the Harry Potter books and movies.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_483?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=483&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I love the Harry Potter books and characters, so I am glad for the latest story.

Albus Potter (Harry and Ginny's son) and Scorpius Malfoy (Draco and Astoria Malfoy's son) have to prevent time from being altered so that Voldemort doesn't win and change reality.

The good:  I enjoy time travel stories, and the idea of going back in time to correct things is interesting. I like how the story continues with next generation after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  The interaction between the characters,  especially Albus and Scorpius' friendship, is engaging.  I like how the characters (Harry, Albus, Draco and Scorpius in particular) feeling they have to meet everyone's expectations, their sense of inadequacy, and how they have grief to deal with is addressed.  The characters having to make the choice to do the right thing is there as it has been through the series.

The problems:  I would like to have seen more of Rose (Ron and Hermione's daughter) and Lily and James (Harry and Ginny's kids).  I wasn't sure what to think about Delphi's character either.  This didn't prevent me from liking the story however.  This is a play, so it is better to watch rather than read the story.  I would be interested in seeing this in novel form, and I do want to see the play when I have the opportunity, but I am going to have to wait until it comes to the States.

In the meantime, this is worth reading, and it works as a standalone story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Loved It!","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2016","** spoiler alert ** Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reconnects with Harry Potter and the gang as they navigate adulthood, raise families and try to suppress a past that doesn't want to stay put.

There wasn't much that I disliked about this novel, except for maybe the fact that it was pretty short and a quick read due to the fact that it was written as a play script.

Otherwise, absolutely entertaining to read if you enjoyed the original series that J.K. Rowling produced. I loved that readers got a chance to continue on yet another adventure with Harry Potter and his friends, as well as watch their children experience some of their own adventures. Like father, like son.

Although Draco Malfoy was pretty much a prick throughout the original series, he actually shows that he's a human being with feelings in this latest novel. And, that his son is nothing like the monster Draco was in school. Little Scorpius ""King Scorpion"" is a wonderfully optimistic kid that seems to find the light in even the most morbid darkness even as he battles rumors of being a descendant of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!!

In comparison, it was interesting to see how one of Harry Potter's children, Albus Severus Potter, seems to harbor a pessimistic, distant attitude having to live in the shadow of his father. While Harry may have pulled out ahead in his battles with Voldy, he demonstrated that he has a LOT to learn about parenthood ... thankfully, Ginny seems to have a good handle on it.

While I have heard varying critiques of the book being offered as a script, it's still a thrilling adventure that the reader gets to embark on. Yes, you don't get as serious detail with the script but if you are familiar with the previous books/movies, or have any amount of imagination that won't stop you from thoroughly enjoying this latest installment in the Harry Potter Series.

Worthwhile read for anybody seeking an escape from reality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's a playwright, which may be different to read if you are not used to it. But I enjoy playwright and this was very well-written. I was a little shocked at how hard-headed and ""mean"" Harry seemed to me at times, but I guess when you've been through what he's been through, you can't be perfect. This was a great epilogue to the series, and I'm always eager to read JK's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_370?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=370&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I don't want to give anything away and honestly the thing I was really hoping for is - will this launch a new set of books?

You'll have to read it and find out.

If you read it and picture a play...you're going to picture the play.  If you read it and try to capture the awe and wonder of the original books...you'll be more than satisfied.  I read this in 2 days.  I cold have finished i one but I had some work to do.

What a great idea for the plot.  Love the NEW Characters!!!!

Being that said I didn't read it when it first came out as there were SO MANY bad reviews. At the end at the start of this year I found myself in a deep Harry Potter groove, it was childhood all over again for me so I decided that I was going to read The Cursed Child as I was growing more curious about it, specially after reading that the play won so many awards.

Now, is this the best plot I've read in my life? No, definitely not and the ""shocking"" plot twist I saw it coming a mile away, I was more shocked for being so obvious and unoriginal that any other reason, I actually broke down laughing on how silly I found it. I read the book at least a  month ago and I had mixed feelings about it, so much that I actually started reading fanfiction of The Cursed Child and I found a GREAT one that continues on with the world The Curse Child introduces us to, the plot is MUCH better and the characters are very well portrayed so it took out a little of my frustrations with the play, BUT as time passed I kept coming back on how The Curse Child made me FEEL. From the start it wasn't so much about the plot, but more about the emotional journey of the characters and that is something I quite love and enjoy.

A lot of people complain about Harry being a bit ""dark"" (which sounds so much to the Star Wars fans saying that Luke is too ""hopeless"" in The Last Jedi) but that's life people!! In our own lives we experience hardships and bad moments, sometimes we grow to be a better person, others we do not, but either way the only way we grow is by being challenged and THAT is the core of Albus's story with his dad; their relationship is a challenge for both of them, not just to one another, but to also in an introspective way. We see how their lives have evolved, changed them and mold them. We have the Potters, and in the other hand we have the Malfoys and the difference is so great! We see how the hero (Harry) and the antihero (Draco) learned and grew out of the different experiences they had to live, how that shaped the relationship with their sons and how that affects EVERYTHING around them.

The lovely thing about The Cursed Child is not the main plot which I find dull, but the journey the characters are embarked on emotionally speaking, and how at the core of it all is the desire for family, to be seen and understood (even for the most unexpected characters); which is something we can all relate to. We have all being teenagers, we all KNOW how it feels when your parents don't see you, or you don't feel loved or understood by them, Albus's suffering is legit, despite being a little self-centered (like all kids at that age) and we see how Scorpius too deals with growing (and quite heart-wrenching) pains, but at the same time we see how they differ from one another and the different perspective both take on life.

Also I have to add that the ""big problem"" in The Cursed Child and that much people don't get is that this is NOT a book. A book, a novel is meant to be complete and whole on itself, it doesn't need anything else to be added. A script on the other hand is not, it is complete only when it is performed and showcased in front of an audience with its actors, scenery and music. I've been hearing the soundtrack created by Imogen Heap for The Cursed Child play and is BRILLIANT! If you love her credit song for Narnia: The Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe you will love the music she created for the play. Is mystical and magical, it takes you somewhere deep within you and into the story; I can totally see the different scenes matched up to her music and it just FITS. So maybe as a written experience The Cursed Child might not be much, but I feel that as a play is something else entirely, although I haven't seen the play, but just by hearing the soundtrack Imogen Heap created I have a deep desire to see it, as it truly transports you to the story, hopefully they will in time bring it so south america, 'cause it would be awesome to be able to be transported to that world, as I find the emotional journey of the characters VERY compelling so being able to see it on stage must be wonderful.

So my advice it this, if you like this type of stories with emotional load and character development, read it, I believe you will enjoy it. If you dislike that type of story and you want those BIG plot twist with an amazing story maybe it will not be of your taste, although everyone has their own definition of what an ""amazing story"" is, but comparing to the other Harry Potter books I say this pot is rather dull, but the emotional road is intense and I quite enjoy that; love character development in stories and Albus relationship with Scorpius is rather truthful and conflicted sometimes too, I feel it is very honest in the way it treats father and son relationships, family relationships, friend relationships, the relationship with yourself and your own darkness as well.

Also, if you have Spotify (or on Youtube) do look up Imogen Heap's soundtrack for the play, I bet that reading the script while hearing the music would be a profound experience, even if we can't see the actors performs, we can well see the characters perform in our minds.

Hope this review can help you all and as said in the title, if you are curious it doesn't matter what anyone else says, go and read it and is your choice if you enjoy it or not, you have the right to both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Yes, it was different, more brash, more confronting and the characters now trying to cope with their own children, trying to keep them safe, just as Dumbledore and the Weasleys, Hagrid , etc had been doing for Harry, Ron Hermoine and yes, even Draco all those years ago....It got me in from the start, even though I thought Ron could have been a bit more aggressive, I thoroughly enjoyed the read, and read it in a couple of hours.

I bought this book seven hours after it was released, and I read it twice in my room before I came down for breakfast. I was so intent on reading it that I just rushed through it and loved it. But after I went back and read it again and again, I had to notice some differences and things that I didn't like about it.

Although this is a great book and the script line makes it seem really interesting and good, I was definitely not reading the same type of story as Harry Potter, and it is clear that this was not completely written by J.K. Rowling. It was really good, but in a very different style and I noticed several times that it would give information that was completely wrong from the Harry Potter series or things that they just made up. The characters acted in different manners and sometimes things happened that just didn't make sense. Also, I loved the time travel, but we have a whole other book about time travel in the third movie, but it tied in with the plot better. I know that Albus wanted to show to his dad that he is also good and can do things, but I just can't see why he'd risk his life to save the son of someone who had rejected him.
I loved the party with Snape in it, and I loved that they introduced new characters, but the Cedric Diggory turning into a Death Eater because he lost the Tri-wizard Tournament is a bit much, as well as the part with Padma getting married to Ron. Hermione going with Krum made Ron jealous! If he went with Hermione why on Earth would that mean that he is jealous of Padma! She is in Ravenclaw and he probably hasn't spoken mroe than five words to her in all their time at Hogwarts. I am also a little bit disappointed that they left out almost all of the kids besides Scorpius, Albus and Rose form the story. I would have liked to hear more about them. Albus is always talking about how he hates Hogwarts, but we hardly even get a view of what is making him hate it, except for a tiny bit at the beginning. And Voldemort having a child... it just seems like a joke to me, because I just finished the Deathly Hallows for the 50 thousandth time, and she is pregnant NOWHERE unless somehow magic makes a baby disappear and appear out of thin air, but let's be honest folks. Also, how can Delphi fly? It says that she learned it from Voldemort, but he can't fly without a wand. The Death Eaters and Voldemort can turn into those black-ball-spirit-things, but they can't just glide without a wand.

But honestly, if you don't focus on that stuff and you're not looking for something EXACTLY like Harry Potter, then this book would be great for you. The script adds a lot of suspense to the story sometimes in the way that it's written and has a pretty good storyline. I absolutely loved it (apart from the mistakes) and gave it a four star because I don't want to be those rude people who just give it one stars. Yes, no story is perfect, but no story is done without work. It doesn't help anyone to get feedback from people after they've spent a year on a book to be told that it is terrible. I liked the book, and I hope that you did (do) too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I didn't have an issue with the story like many readers did, although I can say that it does read a bit like fan fiction rather than a genuine J.K. Rowling story. If the play does come to the U.S. I will likely go see it if only to see if the magic is more reminiscent of the books when it's performed.

Nine years since my favorite book of all time came to an end. So the announcement of an eighth Harry Potter story seemed too good to be true. And finally, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" is here. It only took a day to read--partially because the play-format makes for a quick read, and partially due to my fevered excitement to see what the epic trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were up to now that Hogwarts is so many years behind them.

Without giving away too much of the plot, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" finds an adult Harry struggling to bond with his teenaged middle child, the most troubled of his three children, Albus Severus Potter. In turn, Albus struggles with living in his famous father's footsteps, as well as dealing with the complications surrounding his relationship with Scorpious Malfoy, the son of Harry's former school tormentor, Draco Malfoy. Most notably, however, is Albus' struggle to process the consequences some of Harry's school-day actions, and wondering if there is anything he can do to make up for his father's deeds. Though Harry and Albus at times seem as different as day and night, both are plagued with the unrelenting desire to ""right"" the ""wrongs"" they perceive, even if fate often has other things in store.

While the magic of the original seven books is somewhat lacking due to the story not being in the prose format that we Harry Potter fans are accustomed to, it was still a pretty good story. The overall theme is something that has been done plenty of times before, but seeing beloved characters work their way through it creates a feeling of nostalgia for the original HP tales. Also, much like the HP movies tended to pale in comparison to the rich stories created in the books--reading this, I got the impression that it paled in comparison to what the stage production must be like. I feel like the story likely resonates a lot more effectively in the format it is meant to be experienced in, and can only hope the play is taken ""on tour"" in the U.S. one day.

""Cursed Child"" doesn't quite go as deep and dark as some of the later Potter books, and overall, this story feels a lot more light-hearted, and even fan fiction-like at times. Regardless, it is still full of surprising revelations, despite some being easy to see coming. This book probably isn't the epic return of Harry Potter that fans have been waiting for, but it does satisfy the desire to return to Hogwarts one more time, and to get a ""check-in"" on the characters we grew to love so much during the Potter era.

So while this story does not live up to the seven Potter books before it, I think it is enough to put a smile on the face of true HP fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The plot was good, but it wasn't quite the real Rowling. Scorpius was the best character for hearing Rowling in the writing.

Even though I enjoyed the book, I miss her Dickensian detail and sense of humor. It felt a little fan-fictionish because it lacks much of Rowling's humanistic and humorous voice.

This play make me appreciate the later books all the more. I miss Rowling's clever and intricate descriptions of weird and wonderful people, places, and things. Plays don't have time for that the way novels do.

Still, a quick summer read -- not something that you can say about most Harry Potter books.

This is a great story, and the play format challenges us to imagine the Hogwarts universe in another way.  (Yes, it's different from the books.  Different does *not* mean bad!!)  a plus here is that our family can read the lines together and immerse ourselves as much as Muggles can.  Very consistent extension of the Potter story.  I am secretly pleased that the grown-up Harry confirms what I noticed around Book Three or Four:  he's kind of a jerk.  No one is perfect, not even the Boy Who Lived.

Over the last few months I have actually read this a few times. Each time I read something new, if that makes any sense. I thought I knew all there was to know about this fantastic world that Jo created and then this ""book"" comes along and blows everything out of the water. I can't imagine a world where Ron and Hermione aren't together or where Cedric is a death eater (wtf to that!). Now that I see what a Time Turner can do, I'm not so sure that I want one anymore. Granted Malfoy had his made, but the consequences are far too great, especially toward the end. Talk about bravery. WHEW!

As a director of theatrical productions I could picture the story as it took place on the stage in my mind.  Of course I had images of the original actors and their voices as I read it, but I thought it was conceptually a real achievement.
It has to be nearly impossible to take something so well loved by readers and attempt a new piece of art with it.  The only way to enjoy this is to allow that part of you that loves Harry Potter and allow your imagination and your love of the characters take you on another exciting ride.  Yes, some of the dialogue is a bit shaky and you can tell it wasn't written by J.K., but it's still pretty amazing.  I loved the whole father-son dynamic. It just flowed right from the ending of the original series.
My only regret is that I am not going to see the play tonight!  I want to know how they make all this wonderful magic happen on the stage.  Plays are not really meant to be read, but to be witnessed.  It may have been a mistake to release the play to the masses so quickly. Perhaps it would have been a smoother move to let the play speak for itself until word of mouth demanded a need for the public to read the script.  However, I for one, am thrilled that I was able to read this wonderful addition to the Harry Potter collection and am saving up for my ticket to see the actual show!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_270?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=270&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I'll tell you there are some things to say, and while I shall admit my biases regarding almost anything Harry Potter related, you'll still find I found some things to critique.

As I've said before, the bias I have regarding this book is immense, and I apologise ahead of time!

The Good:
Harry Potter and the characters - need I say more!? This was actually the best part to me about reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child because it gave all of us fans and readers a chance to see an adult Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The most wonderful thing about seeing these characters evolve is that some have changed for the better, and some have stayed the same.
There was no inner dialogue, therefore you are left to your own devices to figure out who the characters really are. Some may actually place this within the 'Bad' things about this book, however I really enjoyed it. It left me to my own devices to judge these characters, and also learn how true they were to themselves through the dialogue itself. If you've read all the Harry Potter novels, than at this stage of the game, not having an inner dialogue doesn't ruin anything because of our own innate knowledge of these characters.

The Bad:
The writing style was not necessarily in line with J.K. Rowling pieces of work. This is minuscule however, because the knowledge of how it was primarily written by the playwrights themselves made it forgivable. It also wasn't detrimental to the entire reading of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I guess for me it was just things that didn't quite fit in the way I read these novels when I've known them since I was young.
This book didn't stick to some historical scenes. For any new readers out there, or individuals not attached to Harry Potter like some fans are, than this small piece is also miniscule. The thing about the scenes that held no 'historical' significance is more or less along the lines of how these scenes were Harry Potter's memories of when he was younger, and in those scenes what was said in the book was slightly different than the play. In regards to the history of some of the events unfolding in the novel when Albus and Scorpius go back in time, it definitely deviated from some of the moments of history - but only in the regards (once again) of what was said. (Not a big deal though!)
Overall, as a heavily biased Harry Potter fan I can't help but to give this new book 4.5 stars out of 5. If I was unbiased based on the above facts, I would most likely rate this closer to a 3.75 or 4... As such though, I still stand by my love for Harry Potter and everything to do with the Wizarding World.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

However, my experience reading this one will make me much more likely to try reading one in the future as I did get the hang of it. I did feel that it was being told by J.K. Rowling however, it did lack much of her descriptive details. All in all I do feel like this writer captured the Hogwarts and Harry Potter feel and I would look forward to a full book.

Harry and his son don't get along and then Harry's scar hurts for the first time in 20 years and creatures are moving in strange ways.  How can this be and what does it mean?

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is (technically) the 8th book in the famous Harry Potter series by J K Rowling. It takes place 17 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and in fact, picks up right where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ends. It details a particular adventure had by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy (sons of Harry and Draco respectively). The use a time turner to try and right what they perceive to be a terrible wrong via a trial and error method that results in a world that has no Harry Potter and where Lord Voldemort rules. As with all the Harry Potter stories, this one deals with relationships - namely the one between Albus and Scorpius as well as the relationship between each boy and his father. Yes, imagine that! A play that features characters who have daddy issues. Gee, that hasn't been done before - like 782,423 times. It's a minor quibble I have with the story, but at least it was done well if somewhat predictably. The only other quibble I have is that the Albus's first two years at Hogwarts are summarily glossed over. I don't understand why that was necessary. It doesn't enlighten the journey of any of the characters or figure into the plot. I did like that the reader gets insight into Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and his understanding of Lord Voldemort. Harry even comes to understand why fate had to roll the way it did in his life. I'd always wondered if he'd ever come to terms with that. Those who know me might wonder if I had any problem with the whole time travel theme. I didn't, but that's only because this is the Potterverse we're talking about here and in the Potterverse, all you have to do imagine something for it to be possible. Now, if you want to know what the consequences of trying to establish a Potterverse in this universe are, I highly recommend reading Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Time travel and its physical as well as philosophical implications are actually addressed there. I found the last third of this book impossible to put down. The story, although slow at first, builds into a very suspenseful tale that is worth your invested time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

My wife is a big fan of Harry Porter series so decided to buy kindle copy online at midnight.
well, the clock turned 12 midnight on the east coast and trying to buy it by refreshing the page for kindle edition , It just didn't work for at least 10 minutes before I just gave up and went to apple bookstore and bought it instantly , no issues at all. Si in my experience there was a delay in kindle launch when ibook was available.

My wife was able to finish it before the book in print arrived in 2 days . She feels it was not excellent but still above average . It's written in play  style so dialogues are there rather than the usual flow of the story .

she is excited to watch the play someday

Rowling, John Tiffany & Hack Thorne
HARRY POTTER and the Cursed Child
Arthur A. Levine / Scholastic
Young Adult / Fantasy

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not a novel. It is a play. The story is by Rowling, and was written by Rowling, Thorne, and Tiffany It is the eight Harry Potter installment, and premiered on a stage in London on July 30, 2016.

This book takes place some 19 years after the Deathly Hallows (Book 7). Albus Potter, the son of Harry and Ginny, is headed to Hogwarts. His biggest fear is the Sorting Hat. He does not want to wind up in Slytherin. Always at odds with his father, Albus knows he will never make it into Gryffindor. It is one more comparison to his father bound to deliver more disappointment.

On the Express to school, Albus befriends a boy sitting alone in one of the cars. Scorpius, like Albus, is plagued by the legend of his father. Although Harry's father was the Wizard of all Wizards--an impossible shadow to crawl out from under, Scorpius' father was the dreadful Draco Malfoy. No one likes him based on this fact alone, and the rumors that Voldemort might actually be his true father. No one, that is, except Albus.

When a Time Turner is recovered, a device allowing for time travel, the tale quickly spins out of control. Amos Diggory (who's son, Cedric Diggory -- the boy murdered in Goblets of Fire by Voldemort) wants Harry to go back in time and save his son; to make it as though the death never happened.

Taking it upon himself to make things right, to maybe impress his own father, Albus and Scorpius, team up with Delphi Diggory (Amos' niece), in an attempt to save Cedric from an untimely death. Their journeys back in time mess up the present. They change the future. Timelines cross.

The damaged caused may be too significant to fix. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco Malfoy are desperate to save Albus, and Scorpius. They fear the return of Voldemort -- and the possible present world where Voldemort isn't just alive, but where he rules the world! Time is of the essence. If the newly revealed prophecy comes to light, the world that they once knew, and loved, would be gone, changed forever!

The play is taut. The Acts, and Scenes perfectly laid out. The story is filled with emotion. It is most definitely a tale about father's and sons. Parents and kids. Depression and hope. Division and reconciliation. The final Scenes brought me to tears. As a fan of the Harry Potter saga, it was amazing to see this story end where Harry Potter's legacy began. Very emotional. I would give anything to see the play. I suppose I will have to hope they make it into a film. I loved placing this finished book on my shelf alongside Rowling's other titles.

This was the biggest plus for me.

A word of caution for other readers is to remember that this is a script. It isn't as detailed or character driven as the books themselves because it is meant to be performed. And as a piece that is meant to be performed I felt that it was well done. I would enjoy seeing the characters make this come to life.

There were somethings that I did not like in terms of the story - but I felt that the money that I paid for the book was worth it - especially to have the ability to be placed back in the Universe of Harry Potter.

I pre-ordered this book a few weeks before its release date and held on to it for the past few weeks until the hype died down. I read very few reviews for this book, knowing only a few basic facts before I went into it. I didn’t even read the synopsis when I ordered it on Amazon because I didn’t want to risk any spoilers.

Luckily, the synopsis didn’t give away the story. I’ve read some mixed reviews about this book, and I can honestly say that the hardcore Harry Potter fans will have issues with how time travel is handled. I went into this as a new adventure, happy to have another Harry Potter story. That’s it. I didn’t analyze every book in the series or make too many comparisons because I wanted to enjoy this story as if it were the lost novel J.K. Rowling stashed away in some drawer. I don’t care about the loopholes or the inconsistencies or the fact certain characters are missing from the story. Okay, I care a little bit, but I did not let it disrupt my enjoyment of this book.

If you’re expecting this book to be a continuation of Harry Potter, you will be disappointed. But if you’re like me and you’re thrilled just to get another glimpse into this world, then you’ll probably rave over it. Another thing to consider is that this is a play adapted to a script book. With plays, the time is limited, and they had to cram a fair amount of information into a short time frame. There are almost always some minor inconsistencies in plays. It’s just how it is and it’s something I’ve come to accept after over twenty years of going to the theater. If you’ve never seen a live production and you’re expecting a full length book with all the questions answered, again you will be disappointed.
What I Love About This Book…

  I forgot how much I missed Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione. I think I missed Ron most of all. I loved him from the second I read about him in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. He’s such a goofball and it was really nice to see him again. He had a few lines that made me laugh and go aww, Ron, I love you.

  Harry is still Harry just older and sort of grouchy. Even though the books were about Harry, I was more of a fan of the secondary characters. My opinion didn’t change after reading this book, and I was glad the focus of this book is on Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.

  I really like the dynamic between Albus and Scorpius. From the start, everyone is hating on Scorpius and he was my favorite character from this book. Each scene with him only made me like him more. He could’ve chosen to be the bad guy at certain parts but the underlying story, just like the original books, comes down to friendship. That’s what I always liked about this series and that part remained intact.

  We get to see Snape again!!! I forgot how much I missed him, too. He was down to help the kiddies and I loved that he was willing to take one for the team once more.

  We see a little bit of Dumbledore, and there’s a really cute exchange between Harry and him where they discuss their relationship. Harry is very annoying in this book, which is why I was glad he wasn’t the focus. But I liked how his conversation with Dumbledore’s painting helped him to see what was wrong in his relationship with Albus. They constantly butt heads because they think they’re so different but it’s because they’re so much alike.

  My favorite book in the series is Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, and for that reason, I was really happy with the plot of this book. I loved being able to revisit parts of my favorite book with the help of a Time-Turner. And without going into detail, that also means you get to see some of the characters from back then, which was really exciting.

  I have always liked Draco Malfoy, and I guess if I had to choose a house I would’ve been sorted into Slytherin. I never gave much thought to this, mostly because I always thought with my personality this would make sense. I love characters like Snape and Draco. Who cares what house they’re in, right? That’s my thinking.

  I also liked the development of Harry and Draco’s characters as family men, and even though they’re not going to hug it out and have a sleepover, I did like that they had come to sort of understanding by the end of the book. There’s a secret about Draco that humanizes him a bit by the end, which I think had a lot to do with Harry’s change of heart.

The Parts That Made My Heart Hurt…

  Although Hagrid was not a character in this book, we did see him through Harry’s dreams. For me, Hagrid was the reason I was sucked into the first book in the series. Well, that and the fact the Dursleys were child abusers and I was so angry about it that I kept reading to make sure Harry got away from them. Sorry for the short rant but I really hate the Dursleys. Anyway, hands-down Hagrid is one of my favorite characters in any book. There is a serious tear-jerker moment where we get to see the past, and when Hagrid sees baby Harry, oh my God, my heart melted. It reminded me why I love Hagrid so much. He’s such a sweetie. I just wanted to hug him.

  There are a few scenes at Godric’s Hollow, and if you’ve read the books, you’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to get into the specifics, but my heart literally hurt for Harry. I was hating on him most of the book until this one particular moment.

  Harry and Albus’ relationship was painful at times, but I was really happy with their overall character development. Some of the exchanges between them made it feel like they were strangers and not father and son. It was sort of depressing to see Albus feel somewhat like Harry did as a kid when he had a father right there. I thought it made sense to some extent, considering Harry did not grow up with a father. It was also very sad to read about.

There wasn’t much I disliked about the book, which is why I gave it 5 Stars on Goodreads. I think I was just too excited to have another Harry Potter book that I was willing to overlook some minor issues with things that J.K. Rowling attempted to fix throughout the series, only for them to reappear in this book. Just writing this review made me miss it even more so I decided to start watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I own all the movies through Amazon, so I couldn’t resist throwing it on just so I could see some of my favorite characters on-screen. And now I need to do a reread of this series, most likely some time closer to winter.

I really tried to limit this review to character development, and I didn’t give any spoilers, not unless you count who made a reappearance, even though I didn’t mention all of them, but other than that, I didn’t reveal any of the plot. You’re in for hopefully a pleasant surprise if you haven’t read the book yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_110?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=110&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I couldn't put my Kindle down.
I've waited for this particular story for what feels like ages, and words cannot even describe for how grateful I am that it finally exists in my hands. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world that we all know and love.

The story starts out at King's Cross with the original trio preparing their school-age children to board the train to start their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

It's at this time that Harry and his son, Albus, share a nice father-son moment:

“Albus: Dad . . .

Do you think — what if I am — what if I’m put in Slytherin . . .

Harry: And what would be wrong with that?

Albus: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It’s not a House of brave wizards.

Harry: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

(I dislike Snape, but the overall conversation made me tear up a bit.)

I also really appreciated that they talked about Slytherin in a positive light.

We have a few time jumps here and there, and then complications arise because Harry - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - seized an illegal Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it.

“The once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.”

Meanwhile, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and struggles with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.
Harry tries to reach out to Albus but finds that he has diffuclity understanding someone different. And their connection wobbles from year to year because of it.

“Harry: Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which was . . . well, I know you don’t love it but . . .

Albus: For you, it’s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .

Harry: Albus, please — can we just —

Albus: . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.

Harry: I’m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.

Albus: The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say — on behalf of wizarding kind — how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?

Harry: Albus, please — you know, I’ve never wanted gratitude.

Albus: But right now I’m overflowing with it — it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .

Harry: Moldy blanket?

Albus: What did you think would happen? We’d hug. I’d tell you I always loved you. What? What?

Harry (finally losing his temper): You know what? I’m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you’ve got a dad. Because I didn’t, okay?

Albus: And you think that was unlucky? I don’t.

Harry: You wish me dead?

Albus: No! I just wish you weren’t my dad.”

Harry and Albus are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.

As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.

The Cursed Child answered a lot of topics that had been left unanswered in my mind, and it makes my heart tighten just thinking about everything.

“Harry: And I’ve locked away the map. You won’t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away — you know that? Wouldn’t let me go in — wouldn’t let anyone go in — you really scared her . . . And me.

Albus: Really scared you?

Harry: Yes.

Albus: I thought Harry Potter wasn’t afraid of anything?

Harry: Is that how I make you feel?

Albus looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.

ALBUS: I don’t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was better between us then either — so — the fact that I’m in Slytherin — that’s not the reason for our problems. It’s not just about that.”

I really appreciated that their relationship was developed in a very honest and raw way.

And not only theirs, but the development of Draco and his son, Scorpius, was truly melting my everything.

“Draco: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.

Harry: Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We’ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we’ve blighted their present.”

Watching Draco care deeply and fiercely for his child made me open up my heart.

Oh, and I wanted to mention how ecstatic I was when Albus befriended a Malfoy. Their friendship was inspiring until the very last heartbreaking page.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_335?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=335&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I get why people think it was disappointing, and they're not wrong - it did read a bit like a fanfiction (a mediocre one at that), and the plot fell a bit flat. But to be honest, I don't think Harry Potter's original plotlines were as wildly original as people seem to think they were. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Harry Potter, and I do think the original canon was better than this book - just not by as much as everyone else seems to think.

I liked the characters. I thought Scorpius was quite charming. Some of the original characters fell a bit flat for me - especially Ron. I'm not really sure what happened with Ron, but his role in the story was so minor that it didn't stick out to me. I wasn't over the moon over the plot, and it was predictable to me, but there were parts I really appreciated.

This book felt like a Harry Potter book to me, if only because I was as swept up in the reading of this book as I have ever been with one of the earlier Harry Potter book. It brought me back to being in high school and waiting for the books and movies to come out, being at the bookstore on midnight the day of release, and the glorious anticipation of waiting to find out what happened next. As a standalone story, this book is decent and would probably get three stars - but I gave it an extra star for the nostalgia factor. So I liked it. I would recommend it to any of my Harry Potter fan friends. Plus, it doesn't take long to read a play - so you may as well give it a go. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Price","This story is FUN and not as CURSED as it has been made out to be....","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2016","I read ALL of the reviews about this story, negative-neutral-positive. I think some may have read TOO much into this. Agree...this reads like fan fiction. That's not entirely a bad thing. The best part is...it's JK Rowling ENDORSED fan fiction. It is a story that, in my opinion, is not really needed, but didn't hurt anything in the franchise. I feel that way about Fantastic Beasts. The original book was a reference tool for the original stories. Now we have a screenplay and movie created out of that is thinly connected to Harry Potter using history. These stories are just fun. There are preposterous situations, characters and scenarios that are a HUGE stretch...but that's okay. I have my seven books that I get to re-invest in as often as I want. HPATCC is/was a quick read and a, kinda, nice ""Where are they Now"" story. The best part is...one them stayed from the original series...and that is the value of loyal, loving FRIENDSHIP. In the original 7, Fantastic Beasts screenplay and this story...it is universal throughout. In my book...that IS the best thing out of all of it. It is also why I gave it 4 stars. Lastly...there were comments about what Harry would/would not do. I would suggest re-reading ""Order of the Phoenix""... Harry was quite different in that book that ""Cursed Child"" had a deja vu feel to it...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

But I didn't go into the book thinking that it would be.  In my opinion, when something is written in a script format, it is up to the actors, the make up artists, the special effects folks, etc. to give it that extra edge and you do not get that from reading this script or any script.

Rowling released The Deathly Hallows. Fortunately, the play offers up a new story in that universe, and not only allows fans a peek back into what once was, but also a peek into the future of what will be.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at its heart a book about what if’s, particularly the one surrounding the death of Cedric Diggory that happened so long ago. The play revolves around that death and why it remains important in the legacy left by Harry Potter, and involves a time travel plot that is both wibbly wobbly and timey wimey. Because of that premise, it gives fans a chance to reconnect with previously beloved characters, but also gives them a chance to know new characters, including Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.

Particularly interesting is the relationship between Albus and Scorpius: although it seems unlikely that the two would ever become friends, it is their friendship that lies at the heart of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. This is a story about two boys trying to live up to the legacies of their fathers (or in Scorpius’ case, trying to rise above the rumors about him and his family). In the end, those legacies are impossible to live up to and create two main protagonists that readers will easily identify with.

Fans expecting a story about Harry, Ron and Hermione as adults, though, will probably find this a disappointing read. The trio’s stories have already been told: this is a new story about those who come after. Although Albus is a lot like his father, it becomes quickly clear that he’s also not Harry him in many ways. Fans will need to put all previous ideas aside because Albus is his own person.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, though, does leave out one character fans might expect to see: Teddy Lupin. There is no mention of Teddy anywhere, although Harry was the child’s godfather. This is a little disappointing, particularly for readers who want to know if he and Victoire Weasley ever got married.

Something else fans have already expressed a displeasure over is that this is not a novelization of the play, but a script. That’s important in reading the story because a script will read differently. For example, there are very few details given in a script as one might expect in a novel and it is up to the reader to fill in most of the blanks. That’s often difficult, especially for those who will not see the actual play where actors will fill in those spaces with their choices.

That aside, though, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a nice story that allows Harry Potter fans to revisit that world they love: at times it’s sweet – offering both laughter and tears – and is a worthy addition to any Potterhead’s library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_462?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=462&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

The only thing I can think of for all the bad reviews is these are young readers. Young as in children when the first book came out and in their 20's now. I am in late 50's. Started reading the series after book 5 came out. I too love the books! I have read them several times and I loved this new story as well. Having lived into my 50's I understand that people change, life has a way of wearing off those sharp edges of passion, the youthful idealism. I could understand how the routine of working, raising kids in a V free world, would make things much less intense for the adult Harry and his friends.  Ron, Harry, and Herimone  still have their friendship that was so special. Even Draco talks about how they shone with love for each other. They see how Draco loves his son, and let him in, let him help. Draco grows and changes too. And while nAlbus goes through some dark times,  it is his friendship with Scorpius that ends up saving him and saving everyone and reminding them all over again the value of friendship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

There's a lot of people who don't like this book because they say that there's plot holes, they don't like that certain characters don't fall for other characters, whatever.  But I love it as a look at the new generation and for the fact that JK explored the psychology of Harry as an adult.  I can't imagine him going through everything that he did as a child without coming out of it in some sort of mental pain, and he's got issues.

I would love to see the play at some point, but unless they travel to a city near me, this is the closest I'm going to get. J.K. Rowling did not write this, it's based off a short story she may (?) have written by herself or with the play author, not totally clear on that one.

On to the review: I enjoyed this. I didn't LOVE it, like the originals, but I enjoyed getting a glimpse into the adult lives of HP characters. It's been awhile since I've read the books, so I could be wrong on this, but some of the characters seemed a bit off to me (probably due to them being written by a different person). That was really the only thing that bugged me.

While enjoyable, the concept of this story has been done before -- it's basically Harry Potter meets Back to the Future or Butterfly Effect.  I liked both of those movies so that suited me just fine.  The plot focuses on two main themes - an unlikely bond between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy and the ongoing conflict between overbearing-dad Harry and bratty-teen Albus.  I wish there was more of Ron Weasley but I guess we can't have everything.  In addition to seeing how the characters from the novels turn out as adults, we get to meet their children and enjoy some cameos from characters who are supposed to be dead.  There is lots of homage paid to the original series, much the way Star Wars Episode VII paid homage to Episodes 4-6 -- I personally enjoyed all the nods in this play to the novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Our youngest had heard about HP and was anxious for her turn to read ""the Sorcerers Stone. Parents were hearing all sorts of rumors and warnings about the books so I bought a copy and read it. This was a story that my baby needed in her life. She started life as an abused, scared child and was placed in foster care. She and Harry had much in common. I bought "" chamber of Secrets"" and she read both books in the few days before ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was released. These books are responsible for teaching the values of friendship, loyalty, courage, and so much more.
I love that Ms. Rowling gave us this last visit with Harry. It's satisfying to see him  in the natural progression of the themes in the series.

She had some say in it but It's not her writing the play. Her name is plastered all over it for saleability. And it is harder to read as a play. You lose a lot of information and personality and closeness as a play. But I did like it. I enjoyed seeing the old gang, including some faces I never thought to see again.

Harry's childhood was not easy and it appears that his son Albus is following in his footsteps.  Albus is sorted into an unexpected house at Hogwarts and his best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's longtime enemy Draco.  Albus has long struggled with being the son of the famous Harry Potter, but this time his struggles will put him - and those closest to him - in very real danger.

I admit that I had mixed feelings about buying “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, knowing it was a play and not a book, and - while was based on her ideas - it was not written by J.K. Rowling.  After reading it, I still have mixed feelings.  To be sure, the story is a good one with Albus struggling in his father's footsteps just as Harry struggles to be a good father (as he says at one point he did not have any good examples to follow growing up).  Albus's friendship with Scorpius is well done - I never thought I would like a character whose last name is Malfoy but Scorpius is delightful - in fact, I think he is the real star of the play.  Besides the expected Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, many old favorites appear in this play (some briefly) and there are some poignant and scary moments.  But in the end, this is a play not a book and lacks some of the character development that was in the books. Albus and Harry's relationship is realistically done but I would have liked to have seen more of James and how Albus gets along with him.  Classroom action is pretty much nonexistent in the play.  I found that the play, which is split into two part and is meant to be seen on two separate nights, is overlong (so much dialogue for the actors to learn, especially the young ones!) and feels like it could have used some editing (perhaps with some of the alternate worlds in the play).  I was never bored while reading the play; it just seemed a long play to be sitting in the audience watching.  Having said that, I would certainly go see the play just to see how they pulled off some of the magic - I bet it is awesome to see in person!

“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is not as good as any of the books in the series, but Harry Potter fans will enjoy it if only to see what Harry, Hermione, and Ron are like as adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I found the story interesting, but the relationships between the characters even more so. I cannot imagine the impact of what has been written as awesome stage effects that bring life to this written word.

I would love to see a series of second generation Potter books that integrate the adults with their offspring.

For those terribly disappointed in this script of the play, I am sure the sparse narration is more than filled in the live stage performance. I came to the books after seeing the movies, so I had visuals to go with the written word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_361?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=361&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A fun fact that I learned until after she finished the book was that she was texting her Harry Potter crazed friend (who already read this book before she received hers). After every chapter, she would text him her reaction.

As much as she loved the book, she's especially a fan of the two leading male characters, she did have a few issues with Harry and a couple of other characters.

Wilbur","Interesting Diaspora","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2016","THIS IS NOT A NOVEL, nor is it written by J.K. Rowling. With that said, it's not bad either. As a play, it would be awesome. If you're looking for a new Harry Potter novel, this is garbage. Keep in mind that this was always intended to be a play & it's fine. The Cursed Child tells an interesting and fairly subtle story about tolerance and acceptance and dealing with expectations...complex philosophical machinations that show sure signs of Rowling's involvement, but this is a script & therefore almost exclusively dialogue without all the internal trepidation & rumination that colors a novel. This is peppered with cameos from many of the beloved Harry Potter characters which is great for the nostalgia factor, but not so peppered with the side-plots and quirky creatures/plants/spells/red herrings that Rowling was able to populate the novels with. If you can take it for what it is, this is a good addition to the larger world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It didn’t quite live up to the original HP series but was a fun addition. As silly as it sounds some of the story was a bit unbelievable or didn’t quite connect the way I had hoped. The idea of time turning was great in its introduction in book three where they could only go back a few hours, but the idea of going back years and changing the complete history by casting a few spells just seems much too powerful to be messed with by any wizard.

J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer, and her books are engaging, witty and cleverly written. This book had an interesting storyline, and was a nice addition to the Potter story, but it was not QUITE as good as previous stories. I'm not sure if I was thrown off by the different energy it takes to read the lines in the play, the fact that J.K. was not the primary author so the ""voice"" was different, or the fact I was just left feeling like more could have been included.

I have to assume that the people who disliked it just don't like the same characters as I do.  I love that alternate universe snape is still every bit the hero, as snape as always been my favorite character.  I have been waiting for draco to get some redemption, to learn that he grew up and made better, less evil, choices in life than his father had, since book 6.  Dumbledore died in part to protect him.  Snape killed one of the greatest wizards of all time to protect him.  Snape was willing to have everyone of colleagues, friends, etc believe he was entirely evil, he gave up any chance at being allowed in public again, to protect him.  I always wanted draco to show that there was something worth protecting, and the draco story we got on pottermore was the exact opposite of that.  So...I am extremely happy with this draco, one who admits he was wrong, one that shows he is human, one who isn't evil, cause I have always wanted that, and was really disappointed when rowling said that draco was not worthy of crushes back in dec 2014.  I also really wanted to know more about harry's kids than we got in the horrible epilogue.  We only got that for 1, and that's disappointing, but maybe there will be more in the future.  I also love that the fate of the world relied on neville, another favorite of mine.  I loved the storyline, I loved the plot, I wish there was less angst, but, yea, not enough that I think it loses any stars.

Plus, it's more harry potter, and more harry potter is never a bad thing. ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_462?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=462&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I'm really puzzled by all the negative reviews written about this great sequel to the Harry Potter series.  Many reviewers seem to feel that the play differs so much from the books themselves that J.K.Rowlings could not have really been very involved in its writing.  I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE!  The story itself is wonderful and Rowling's involvment couldn't be more obvious.

I'll admit that initially I was a little disappointed by the fact that this story is presented as a script and not the usual novel format.  I'm not a great fan of reading scripts.  But within about 2 minutes I completely forgot about that aspect because the story is good...it pulls readers in...and the format itself is done so well that it doesn't detract from the story in any way.

Before I wrote my review I read many of the existing ones and did some research of my own to answer a few basic questions.  One of my top questions was 'how and why was Jack Thorne selected as the writer?'  I learned that he's a relatively young playwrighter and screenwriter who has already built up an amazing reputation.  The Guardian writes that ""He's quickly establishing himself as one of Britain's most sought-after writers.""  The Guardian maintains that his talent is unusual because ""he's equally prolific in both theatre and TV.""  And also that there's no doubt that ""Thorne will achieve the first instance of a play text becoming a runaway No 1 bestseller. ""

More importantly, Rowlings herself was the main reason Jack Thorne was chosen as the writer...her involvement in the selection and writing process is very easy to document via Google.  The last shred of evidence is included in her dedication at the beginning of the play manuscript.  Rowling's Dedication to Jack Thorne reads ""To Jack Thorne who entered my world and did beautiful things there. —J.K. Rowling""

I also discovered that Jack became a first-time father while working on ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.""  His own Dedication, also in the beginning is to his newborn son Elliot Thorne who was born on April 7, 2016.  It was something I missed when I first read the play and I think knowing that adds an a personal element that's sweet.

Without revealing too much of the plot line, I think that this story does a remarkable job of continuing on from where ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" left off in the epilogue.  It answers questions about how Harry and his friend's families grew and evolved overtime as well as how he and his friends developed personally and in their careers. It's a compelling story exactly because everyone isn't how you might have envisioned them to be later in life.  It mirrors real life so well in this regard.  What our intended courses were versus what the real courses our lives have taken are oftentimes very different from each other.  It's puzzling to me why those that criticize the play don't understand this.

In reading the positive reviews I was struck by how many people wrote that they wished this story were longer...because I felt the same way.  Although it ended and closed well...I didn't want it to end.  And I do agree with some of the criticisms that mentioned there are too many characters who are left out of the story entirely...and who I'd like to hear more about as well.  But overall, I think this story was perhaps one of my favorites because it did a great job of not overemphasizing the negative 'dark' plot lines that can scare younger readers (or play attendees.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The storyline feels silly and pointless and the ""twist"" is neither shocking nor surprising. It also lacks that certain something in the narrative that J.K. Always brought to the books that leads me to believe that her involvement was less than they let on - and I don't think this is only attributable to the fact hat it's a play and not a novel. However, the emotional story between father Harry and son Albus feels genuine. It's worth a read, but I would say it hardly felt like the ""eigth installment"" in the HP series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I will say it took me until about Act One : Scene Three to get the hang of reading the script but after that it was like reading a book, just with a little bit less description (as is meant to be, seeing as this is the script to a play that will fill in the visual details).

My rating is 4 because it was more than I expected, it was smart and fun. I see JKR in the story and sequence of events, even though the style is so different.
However, I didn't buy the way some of the characters were represented, Ron, for example, was of a really different personality than in the novels, and I really don't believe he would turn out like that, they weren't fair to him. The way some of them ""spoke"" was also quite different from their usual tone, but again, I didn't expect it to be perfect, so it was good enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I hope they write a sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_481?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=481&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

You have to like plays, and you have to be imaginative enough to build a world in your head using just dialogue. So all of the negative reviews saying that this doesn't conlare to the other books... They're right. Because this isn't a book. It's meant to be performed, and we are just lucky enough to get to enjoy it without having to fly to London and see the play.

I thought it was wonderful. A terrific extension to the Harry Potter story. I don't want to give away spoilers, but I loved it.

Love getting to read more Harry Potter!

Yes, this is a script so it is different from a novel, but you get used to reading it after a few pages.

Being a script I would compare reading this to watching one of the movies as opposed to comparing it to one of the previous novels. Definitely not the details you see in J.K. Rowling's novels but that is because this is basically people talking. You don't get to hear all the thoughts going on in Harry's head.

I would still recommend this to any true Harry Potter fan, just know what you're getting when you buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_322?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=322&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I liked the kids and how their parents struggled to relate to them and it also gave insight into what it's like to be an adult in this wizarding world.

Idiotic this is a play and it's written as such. The emotions are to be read between the lines. I understand this as a theatre major and I honestly think this was a brilliant idea for JK Rowling now the Story of Harry can be told through generations and travel around the world in productions. I'm happy she didn't make this into a Summer blockbuster that would soon be forgotten. Jo is brilliant. This story took me back to place of magic and I loved reading it as an adult with my own child.

I enjoyed being immersed in the wizarding world of Harry Potter again.  This story focuses on the next generation of wizards, specifically Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.  These two sons of famous nemeses form an unlikely friendship during their first year at Hogwarts.  The play fast forwards time quickly through their years at Hogwarts while also presenting the reader with each sons' difficult relationship with their fathers.  Harry Potter, the beloved orphan-turned-wizard hero who everyone loves has difficulty bonding with his middle son.  What an overwhelming reputation for a son to live up to!  Scorpius has to deal with his own problems and devious rumors that make him an outcast as well.  The friendship between Albus and Scorpius plays out nicely and leads to a fun and eye opening adventure that causes many problems to be solved.

As much as I liked this book, I felt it was a fast read and left more to be desired.  I missed the detailed descriptions of the wizarding world that I loved in the original books.  This book/play moves faster and doesn't have the same attention to detail.  But that shouldn't stop anyone from reading this book.  I loved the way the angst of being a teenager and parenting a teenager was played out.  The story still focuses on friendship, courage, and love, which was so much a part of the previous books.  I would recommend this story to all Potter fans, who I am sure have already finished it!  I do hope to see the play one day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

For anyone saying that the characters do not stay true to themselves, I'd like to question whether you believe you would be the same as your teenage self 19 years down the road. No, you will not be. No one could expect you to be. So why do you open this book with the expectation that you will be reading the characters in their teenager minds.

They have grown, they have changed and most importantly, they have had children. As a parent, I can tell you that I am no where close to being who I was before my daughter. If you haven't had kids, you would not understand.

My last point is that we never really got much insight into their adult lives in the previous books. We got one chapter. ONE. The lines from that chapter existed in this story as well.

So for those that choose to not read it or give it a bad review simply because it's the characters don't stay true to their teenager selves, I say wait 19 years and see how much you have changed.... then judge this book again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_243?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=243&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I was nervous about this story.  One of the things I loved so much about the original Harry Potter series was Rowling's writing style.  She has this way of completely enclosing the reader in the world of witches and wizards.  And as much as I love plays, I just wasn't sure if this would match up.

I want to just state for the record -- I was pleasantly surprised.

The new characters have been taken straight from Rowling's mind.  Thorne did a wonderful job of making Albus, Scorpius, and the new set of Hogwarts witches and wizards the same as Rowling would have, had this been a novel.  For me, that was a huge relief.  It made it so much easier to get sucked into the story.

The storyline was also classic Rowling.  It was a moral story (don't mess with time!) and a story about relationships between fathers and sons (and daughters).  But it wasn't overtly obvious or preachy.  It was just a good story.

I'm not going to make this review very long because if you're a Harry Potter fan, you've already read this or added it to your TBR list.  And if you're not a HP fan...how very dare you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

So with high expectations, I pre-ordered the kindle version & like many many many others, stayed up the first night of its release to finish the ""book/play"" (approx. 2-3 hours). Then, I went back to re-read all the seven HP books on my kindle. Fair to say, HP and the Cursed Child definitely cannot compare to JK Rowling's original writing in the other HP books, but you're introduced to many new characters. *Bonus- there are SO many twists and unexpected reveals in this play which I truly enjoyed (although most were unbelievable).

Bottom line, if you're a die-hard HP fan like I am, get this play- I definitely think it's worth it. However, take the content in HP & the Cursed Child with a grain of salt because I don't believe that Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, etc. would truly have grown up this way. Hopefully the next release will be written by Rowling herself so that she can develop a more believable future for our beloved characters!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It has to be short so you can watch it in the average time of a play. Yes it's a different kind of book.

lol
I didn't know much about the plot when i started reading the book, and one of my biggest fears about any new stuff in the HP world, would not have Harry in it. i was sooooo happy to see that was not the case in this book.

this is not the kind of harry potter book we are used to. it isn' really written as a book. it's a play. sort of like reading a script, which makes it super fast to read.
it does have a nostalgic feel and i have to say this, when i read the Epilogue on Deathly Hallows i couldn't stop crying. Harry and the gang, all grown up, taking their kids to platform 93/4 to take the hogwarts express... harry married ginny. hermione married ron... after folowing their adventures that ending just made me so happy i couldn't stop crying.
we get so involved with these fictitious characters, dont we?
yeah so i couldn't stop crying throughout the whole epilogue, didn't matter how many times i read it. even years later. i cried on the movie too. and every single time i watched it after that. silly i know.

but then... what happened was that i couldn't stop crying while i was reading this book. lol
no spoilers but it starts EXACTLY at the Epilogue in DH. i started reading it sunday night after i finished watching the last movie and i had to stop. i was sobbing!!! lol

it was amazing travelling back into harry's life. it was great to see them as adults and dealing with life after everything that happened to them. especially harry. and draco. im happy they were all there and the story was a good balance between the new kids and the old.

it left me wanting more tho. not even more stories, it does have a finality to it in my opinion. a sense that yeah... NOW the story is over.
but it left me wanting so much more of this particular story.
it's a play... it's short compared to all the other books. it doesn't have all the reach details of a story written in a book. it really concentrates solely on the main characters and the main story... where a book can branch out a bit more, florish around, and give way more details! i missed more stuff about james (son, not father) and Lily (daughter) Hugo is barely mentioned. I really want to know more about Draco's wife and their own story. Little scorpion... how not to love that little man??? a book could spend so much more time with him and Albus.

the cursed child as is is a GREAT story... i highly recommend. i finished yesterday and i need to read it again. that's how awesome it is.
But i hope and wish with all my heart JK Rowling writes a REAL HUGE BOOK and then that it becomes a movie.... with all the actors back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_428?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=428&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I was never satisfied with the prologue in book 7. And I'll tell you what, this script took me on a whirlwind of emotions and adventures and I am now more envious than ever of those who get to see it!

About the nay-sayers who don't want to see this as canon: I actually completely understand why it might have a lack of magic for them, because as a script it does take a lot of imagination and some rereading to really get into the fun of it. Honestly, it was jarring and you have to apply the characters personalities rather than experience them. It does make for a rough read. However, I felt just as much, if not more, emotion from the script and I felt it was super realistic and true to Harry, Ginny,Hermione,Ron, Draco and their kids! I can absolutely see, and definitely appreciate, the struggles of normal life that comes after a fantastic adventure. They are older, and now having to experience normal everyday life, and they experience the fun and hardship of parenting. I'll say only that to keep the secrets!

I do think this is fanfiction, but it is the ultimate fanfiction where the original source author not only auhorized it, but joined in the fun. To me, this is absolutely canon, but even if you don't feel that way, don't let it ruin your experience. It is still a fun read, even if you want to pretend none of it happened in Harry's world, and I can only imagine how great it is to see on the stage. I personally loved seeing what happened to my favorite characters and their children. Scorpius is now my favorite character and I hope to see more stories about him and Albus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_436?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=436&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Read with caution :-)

This is a good book. It was entertaining and a nice, quick read. A word of warning to Harry Potter fans: It is VERY different than the main books. It doesn't feel like a continuation of the book. It's a shame that it was marketed as the next chapter as, to be honest, I don't think it fits that well with the main book. There are some odd parts and some of the rules of magic aren't entirely consistent (The time travel aspect in particular is really bad.) However, it's nice to see new characters and old characters brought back. Some people really hate the way Harry is portrayed as he's kind of a jerk at times. However, I quite liked this. Harry isn't put up on a pedestal and shows human flaws. To be honest, I thought Harry was portrayed as flawed in the last two books of the main series as well, so I'm not sure why people are so upset about that aspect.

Overall, a good read, but don't expect it to be the same as the main series. Look at it as a JK Rowling endorsed fan fiction and you'll be much more satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

It is written in script form, so that took a little getting used to.  I liked the plot and seeing how the characters interacted as adults as well as their children.  I felt the story line could have been a little more developed, though.  We see Albus start first year and then we are in the fourth year with little to expand on what happened in between.  James is hardly mentioned, which was disappointing.  I understand this was written as a play and not as a novel, but perhaps a novel form would have done it more justice.  Still, a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Though lacking the depth of a true novel, it leaves me wanting more.  I personally find it very frustrating that the production is currently so limited (as any stage play is) - I won't be able to ever see the original performed (and it looks to be a truly amazing production).  I hope the will either film it, or produce it as a motion picture eventually.

Good pacing - and if you were to see it over two nights - well the cliffhanger would be nearly unbearable. (Though I don't  want to see it as two movies).

The original books were all written for children - the age of Harry himself in each book.  I feel this continues here - now dealing with Harry as a parent.  Rowling does a good job exploring the fears and hopes of parenting ( and of children learning that their parents are actually people too).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_476?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=476&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

The old characters are likable as always (though Harry and Draco specifically receive some sublime character development), the new characters are likable (for the most part), and the villain is intimidating and threatening. The story is full of many creative twists and turns, emotional moments, surprise reveals, unexpected connections, and a great mix of suspense and thrills.

Keep in mind this is a play- there are more punchy jokes to get the audience laughing, and the plot is simplified (not nearly as many angles or reveals as previous books) but I really think this is the only way the final part of the story could be told. The books are untouchable and there's an absolutely magical quality that can't be recreated.

O'Reilly","It was great","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2016","Lots of people will tell you that it sounds like a bad fanfiction. I don't believe that. You have to get in the mindset that it is a play. After that, I think it's great. It's a little plausible, (no spoilers) but nothing you could guess from reading act one scene one. I really loved it. I think if you are trying to decide if you want to read it, my advice is this; try a sample, or just read it. The worst that will happen is that you won't like it. Well too bad. It may have escaped your notice but life isn't fair. It's hard to tell if you will like it just from others' reviews, or reading the description. Ignore people telling you it's bad, ignore people telling you it's good. You must decide on your own. It is our choices that really define us, so make the choice to try it. Please. Just try it. Also, to those saying it's not like a novel, obviously. It's a play, it's not a novel. Also, everyone asked for J.K. Rowling to write more. She has. Beggars can't be choosers.

M.","It's a Script, and Not a Final Script at That","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","Something a lot of reviewers seem to be missing is the designation as a ""rehearsal script."" In other words, this is what the play more or less looked like when previews began back in June, but not what's currently appearing in the West End. The whole point of rehearsals and previews is to figure out what works and what doesn't and eliminate the latter. The final script, with all the revisions, is supposed to be published next year. It takes a while to print several million books (Scholastic said their initial print run was 4.5-million), so the printed script was frozen weeks before the play, making it entirely possible that a lot of people are complaining about things that aren't even there any more.

As an actor, and sometime producer, the thing that struck me about this script is the complexity of the production. I honestly doubt you'll ever see community theatre productions, first because of the length, which is over five hours for both parts, and then because of the frequent scene changes and complicated stage effects. This is a play that can be staged with a budget in the millions, but you're probably not going to manage it if you only have a few hundred available for scenery, costumes, and props.

In any case, it's difficult to get a complete feel for this. As in just about any play script, there is very little in the way of description. Just a relatively simple indication of location and action, and the rest is carried by the dialogue. With a bit of luck, perhaps the West End production will be filmed and we'll be able to judge that as well. Or, perhaps, Rowling will decide to turn it into a novel and fill in what seem like gaps in a basic script.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_368?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=368&reviewerType=all_reviews","6 people found this helpful"

I enjoyed it thoroughly. Maybe because I had low expectations for it? I think if you are reading this expecting it to be as good as or exactly like any of the original 7 books, you will be disappointed.  But it was enjoyable, and a great way to revisit the world of Harry Potter that I love and miss. It definitely has limitations being written as a script, and it isn't on par with the novels by any means, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have value of it's own. Is it the kind of fleshed out 8th book that JK Rowling would have written if she were to written a full novel on her own, of course not. But it was fun to read, fun to get a bit of Harry Potter back and I devoured it in one sitting basically. Glad I read it , despite the negative criticism surrounding it. I especially have to laugh a bit at everyone whining about Harry's ""moral integrity"" and that this character would NEVER do this or that.... which come on, is ridiculous...  did we all forget what a whiney, surly, self absorbed JERK Harry was for book number 5? yeah. he doesn't always take the high road. I guess I read this more as a story about the kids than a deep dive into the psyche of Harry, Ron and Hermoine... there are parts that I rolled my eyes at, but for an entertaining few hours, which is basically what I am looking for in a book, it was perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I didn't hate it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019","This is a script. It's not a movie to watch, it's not a book to read. It's missing all of JK Rowling's clever descriptions and adverbs after every line of dialogue. It completely forgets that Tonks had a baby before the end of the last Harry Potter book and it assumes that Hermione Granger would join a bureaucracy rather than stay as an auror. It feels very much like A/U fanfiction at times with some of the characters they bring in, but it also explores some moments in a way that really were interesting and refreshing. I liked what happened to Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, and Draco and how they all handled their kids being in Hogwarts... I just ended it feeling like at the end I was never to take it seriously as a part of the Harry Potter universe.

If you don't regularly read scripts, this will be challenging to enjoy.

This book was so much more than I imagined, I could never have guessed that this was how the story line was going to go, which was great since I was able to be surprised & love it that much more!

I loved the surprises along the way since they made the story that much more enjoyable.

I always loved Draco in the books and movies and this play just made me love him more, as well as the rest of the gang!

The characters Al, Scorpius, Rose deserved a book and the plot, especially of the children and their time at Hogwarts deserved to be a well thought out and written book.  J.K.

(A) This is not a pure work ...","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2017","I have been a Harry Potter fan ever since the books came out. I've read so many negative reviews about this written script and I see why people don't like it. (A) This is not a pure work of JK Rowling , there are 2 other co-authors.  So, the characters that we've grown to love seems ""out of character"" because of different word choice. Again, this is not purely a JK Rowling work. (B) This is written for a play format, thus the characters in the play have to state out loud the emotions they are feeling. How can the live audience know what they are feeling if they don't say it out loud? Unlike in the original books, we know what's going on inside their minds because we are reading them off the book. Thus, again, the characters seem ""out of character"" because of this. (C) The book/script is fast paced because the whole script/book covers Albus' journey through Hogwarts up to their fourth year (I think). It is unlike the original books where each year has one book dedicated to it. This is my objective review. lol. Now, I docked off one star because (spoiler alert), why is Albus devoid of talent? Like zero? Not even one? I thought we inherit intelligence from the mother, isn't Ginny a vivacious talented witch? He is brave, for sure, but his stupidity caused all the trouble in the world. But I guess that is why we have a story. Harry's son got insecure, so he starts on a reckless/stupid journey to prove something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Zethmayr","We have also read other plays like Waiting For Godot","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","My husband just read the play aloud to me, doing all the voices aloud, adding the stage directions.  The posted reviews of the book were very discouraging, but the theater reviews have been stellar.  We have also read other plays like Waiting For Godot, Richard the Third and Twelfth Night.  We are used to filling in the scenery and fleshing out the ""text.""  The script is good and tight.  It really moves, twists and turns, carrying the tension in the rhythm of the dialogue.

A play is not a novel.  There are no details beyond where actors stand and what they say.  The reader must be able to recreate the pictures in the mind, in this case, from all the preceding novels.  The play runs 5 hours, about as long as it took my husband to read it aloud.  It was gripping.  Had this been one of the Potter novels, it would have run into three books!  Plays are concentrated story telling, like frozen orange juice.  The reader must add the water to the proper dilution without learning all about oranges.

I believe that this play will become the new ""Our Town"" of high school productions in years to pass, that theater can become a real local pastime with strong, well written scripts like this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_374?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=374&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As parents, the Granger- Weasleys and the Potters were true to life, not as you could have pictured them 25 years before. No one is perfect! Malfoy and Potter have boys that they can't figure out. Ron is still doing magic , jokes, and his interest in Muggle  driving hasn't changed. He and Hermione Granger have side parts. I loved the use of Polyjuice  as in earlier stories.

I COULD NOT put this down once I started reading it. Oddly, the screenplay format does do the story justice. So many layers within the story: father/son, friendship, a story of understanding oneself, and the altogether 'normal' story of good v evil.

Just want to say that I LOVE the characterization of Scorpius Malfoy, and imho, Rose Granger - Weasley comes across as having the worst traits from her parents: her mother's stubbornness and her father's prejudice. Album Severs has the broodiness of his father, and Draco Malfoy is still the Slytherin we all love.

So, question: just who IS the 'Cursed Child?' Is it Harry, who can't escape being 'the Boy Who Lived' even at age 40? Is it Albus, who is ""cursed"" with having an infamous father and legacy to live up to? Or is it Scorpius,  who is ""cursed"" with rampant gossip about his parentage as well as the nearsightedness of his friend (Albus) and his potential love interest (Rose) (btw, the play between Rose and Scorpius would make anyone think of James and Lily Potter).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_158?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=158&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Miss the Details a Novel Would Have.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2016","“Do you know there is a new Harry Potter book out?”  I have been asked this countless times over the past couple of months.  I did know there was a new Harry Potter tale out, but I knew it was a play that was opening in London and the script was being published as a hardcover – not as a narrative book.  I also know that J.K. Rowling said that the Harry Potter series stopped by book seven and I felt unwilling to move on from what had been promised.  Then I kept hearing snippets of all sorts of intriguing things happening in the Harry Potter world and I could not resist anymore and ordered the book.

I first fell in love with Harry Potter in my undergraduate years at Michigan Tech in the late 1990’s.  The first two books had been published and I heard great things about them.  I received them for a Christmas present and soon found myself engrossed in the tale.  Friends would laugh to find me in cubbyholes between engineering classes reading furiously.  I preordered each of the following novels and loved the entire series.  Was I ready to see what happened to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger 19 years later?  Yes.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child starts off right where book seven ended – with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione dropping their kids off to take the Hogwarts Express to school.  Harry’s middle son, Albus, worries that he will be sorted into Syltherin and his worst fear is realized.  He also befriends Draco Malfoy’s young son, Scorpius.  Harry and Albus struggle with their father and son relationship, especially when Harry tries to ban the friendship between Albus and Scorpius.  Albus feels adrift and decides to correct what he feels was his father’s greatest error by stealing a Time-Tuner with Scorpius and a new friend, Delphi.  They travel back to the Triwizard Tournament that was held in Book 4:  The Goblet of Fire.  Things don’t go exactly as planned and time goes amuck.  I thought of this as Back to the Future 2 after Biff goes back in time and screws up the future.  Will Albus and Scorpius be able to remain friends?  Will time go back to what it was or will dark forces be unleased?

I really enjoyed this play, and it really made me want to see it on the stage.  I hope it comes to the United States one day and/or gets turned into a fantastic movie.  It was a very engaging story.  I missed the great detail that is found in a Rowling novel and wished that she could turn this story into a full-fledged novel.  As it was a play, it was a very quick read.  This was welcome as my oldest son (10-year old Kile) started the Harry Potter series at the end of July and just finished book six today.  I realized I better get this review up as he will be reading this play before I know it!
My favorite quotes:

“Meet the once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.  I will leave you in peace, sir.  If peace is the right word for it.” – Mr. Diggory

“The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution.  Dumbledore.” – Harry Potter

“I don’t care what you did or who you saved, but you are a constant curse on my family, Harry Potter.” – Draco Malfoy

Do you enjoy reading plays?  What is the play you’ve enjoyed the most?

Are you a fan of Harry Potter?  Have you read The Cursed Child?  If so, what did you think?

Overall, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a great story.  I would have loved the detail that a novel would have contained, but the storyline was intriguing. I also loved the growth and different three dimensional view the storyline gave many of the characters, in particular, Draco Malfoy.

I got this book from Amazon a few days after it came out and read the whole thing in one day. I would have rated this book five stars, but I only rated it four for a few reasons-
* The book is written in script format, since it was based off a play, which is kind of annoying, but once you get used to it it's just as good as reading a normal book.
* Some bits of the story, like the Trolley Witch, seem a bit ridiculous (but isn't the whole Harry Potter series that way?)
* Rose Granger-Weasley and James Sirius Potter are barely in it, and Teddy Lupin isn't in it AT ALL.

But overall it's great <3 It's really cool to read about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco (unfortunately, Neville and Luna aren't in it) in the future and it was also really cool to learn more about their kids (especially Scorpius)

I would totally recommend buying this book if you're a Harry Potter fan!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

A play, being intended for a theatrical performance, is inherently different, it requires more of its reader's imagination. ""The Cursed Child"", because of its form, lacks all the richly detailed descriptions of the Harry Potter books.  Instead we are given dialog and the briefest of setting details.  Does it capture the magic of J. K. Rowling's world?  Yes.  Is it worthy of its ancestors?  Oh, yes, emphatically yes!  The plot ties tightly into the Potter world we already know, its characters and issues.  We see that world nineteen years after Voldemort's defeat, and primarily through the eyes of the next generation.  I rooted just as hard for Albus and Scorpius as I had for Harry and Hermoine.  I felt relief as Part 1 was successfully resolved but apprehension as Part 2 began.  Having now finished “The Cursed Child” I find myself wondering how so many others were not as completely enthralled as I was.  A worthy successor to the books.  Thank Ms. Rowling.  Many, many more, please.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_358?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=358&reviewerType=all_reviews","5 people found this helpful"

Based on a new original story by JK Rowling and John Tiffany -- the script has been written by Jack Thorne, and performances of the West End production in London opened the same day as the book's release (coincidentally, also Harry Potter and JK Rowling's birthday--July 31).

The play is set 19 years from when we last saw Harry at the end of Deathly Hallows (Book #7) -- Harry now works within the Ministry of Magic, is married to Ginny and has 3 children. The story focuses on Harry's second son, Albus Severus, (namesake of both Dumbledore and Snape). In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry, Albus makes an unlikely best friend - Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. Albus also gets sorted into an unlikely house -- the house of Slytherin.

Albus and Scorpius soon find themselves on an adventure through time, back to the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which took place in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book #4) over 20 years in the past. Not surprisingly, they find out that changing events in time is a dangerous & tricky ordeal with dire consequences. They will need the help of their family and friends (including Harry, Ron, Hermione and other well loved characters from the series) to right their wrongs and return to the present time.

The play primarily explores themes of father/son relationships and friendship - the strengths and weakness of both. It is a quick, fast-paced read; I received my copy in the mail on Monday and had it read by Wednesday evening. It is a must-read for any Harry Potter fan, although as a play it lacks the descriptions a novel would have had time to flesh out. As a play, however, it includes stage directions that allow readers to imagine beyond the text -- and it is packed with both action and heart. After a successful run on London's West End, perhaps it will come across the pond, giving American Harry Potter fans equal chance to relive the magic, seeing ""The Boy Who Lived"" once again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I mean, I'm not interested in putting on a play, why would anyone order it?! So looked into returning it, without even reading it.
I'm so glad I was not able to return it!
I eventually picked it up and gave it a quick read, scripted and all... And guess what?! I couldn't put it down!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!!

I also wanted to say I liked the concept for the kids in this (I'm trying to avoid spoilers so bare with me.) Also I find the main antagonist's origins very plausible. Considering the obsession factor of the mother in that situation I could see it.

I don't want to write a long review because I will start such an in-depth analysis it will be hard not to avoid spoilers. Its a bit different of a read than the first 7 books because it is a PLAY. It is a script. There's not a lot of descriptive imagery here, but that's okay because we pretty much have those scenes laid out in our heads from reading the first 7 books or watching the films. Its strictly dialogue, which makes it a very quick and easy read. Its a lovely story.

I am so glad that I started reading it. It moved quickly for me (but I am a very fast reader and have read plays previously.  I did not like the the twist in personalities of the boys at first. then I found that it made them all the more endearing. It was good and it was hard to put down. it took me about a day to read it only because I had work and slept. I knew if I started to read it before bed, I would have stayed up to finish it.

I enjoyed the interaction of Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Draco and Ron. I enjoyed the mentions of others from the previous books as well. I would have loved to hear about more of them. There were definite sad points, where you feel as though your heart might break for these characters all of them the parents and the children.

I agree that HP did some things that seemed out of character, but obviously he would be different as an adult than he was at 17.  I absolutely loved the character Scorpius!

Rowling's work, but rather a cooperative effort. The story itself, dealing with Harry's son, Albus, might have been everything I'd hoped it would be, had it not been for the problem that, in my opinion, the writing did not hold true to the standards to which I have come to look forward with Ms. Rowling's work. Differences in writing skills aside, I tried to see beyond the inconsistent style, to the meat of the story.

Dealing with the relationship between father and son, Albus' rebellion against who he felt people expected him to be, as Harry's son, and his discovery that he was more like his father than he thought, does make for an interesting evolution of the HP saga. In this tale, however, Albus just seems more like a pouting, rebellious child who feels put-upon by having a famous father. Unlike Harry, he seems to lack the noble character of his father at first, preferring a pity-party over 'sucking it up and dealing with' his life.

Albus doesn't seem to have the soul-deep, innate sense of honour that defined Harry (not to mention thevery deep type of person he appeared to be in the last scene of Deathly Hallows, both in the book and movie), and yet the reader is supposed to just love the little guy to death, simply because he's Harry's son? The blurb of the book indicates that we are to feel compassion for this child who is finding it hard to fill his father's shoes, but I stopped feeling sorry for him early on, even though there were still times that I sympathized throughout the story.

There was very little in this book that ""fit"" with the HP saga, from the grown up versions of Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione and Draco and his family...oh, yes and speaking of which, what was with the very thinly veiled inference to Scorpius' attraction toward Albus? If you're going to have the character gay, be up front about it...or if he wasn't (he did have a crush on Lily), at least delve a little deeper into what that attraction actually was: admiration? envy? brotherly love (sure didn't seem that way)? or maybe just a preteen questioning where his psyche lies? Better yet, leave it out altogether, because all it did was detract from the side-story of a deep friendship developing between two boys whose fathers were, at one time, enemies.

Now, this sounds like I didn't enjoy the book, but in truth, I found a lot to like about it, even if it wasn't very J.K.-ish.. However, to agree with another reviewer, it just seemed more like fanfic. Had it followed the character of the characters more closely, and played true to what we HP fans already know about the wizarding world after around twenty years or so of visiting, through books and movies, the book could have been exceptional. As it is, it was simply a pretty good read, IF you'd never been introduced to Harry and the gang.

This should have been a GREAT book, but there was no justice done to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I wasn't to excited to get started reading the play format so finished a couple other books first. BUT... Once I got into the story I could not put it down. I disagree with one reviewer who felt the play did not feel like a Harry Potter story. The script format did make for a somewhat ackword flow to the plot. A lot happens from one scene to the next and most scenes were very short. But I could easily visualize the characters and environment as if I was viewing a movie. There were references to many of the events from the movies and I felt this added to my enjoyment of the play. The story is suspenseful and and has some unexpected surprises. There is a cliff hanger between parts 1 and 2 that heightens the suspense. I would like to have read this as a novel; maybe we will see one in the future. I did see a WB teaser trailer on You Tube for a Cursed Child movie... to be released in 2018. It looked legitimate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The writing of this book is difference than others. This is not really a full Novel type but a screen play as Author already informed us.
The story line itself, this is NOT a book about a boy Harry. He has grown up, become a father. And of course, no such things as perfect life, each family will have some challenge either small or big, challenge with communicating with their kids. Harry is no exception.

I would recommend this book. Read for yourself before you judge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_338?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=338&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I have been reading about Harry's adventures since I was 11 and now as a parent myself I was so happy to see Harry experience the ups and downs of parenting while I do so myself. I also loved the way she kept it fun and interesting for the younger crowd by focusing the story in Harry's son's adventure. I was really disappointed when I originally heard about the play being released only for the fact that I knew that I wouldn't be able to leave the states to go see it.

One thing you should understand is that this is a script to a play and not a proper novel, so don't go in expecting it to be anything like the other books in the series, it's meant to be experienced as a play (for example the book details where characters will appear on the stage and things like that.), and just reading it isn't giving you the full experience.
I see many people complaining about the characters and story, apparently expecting the content of a full novel from something that is only a script to a play with a very limited amount of time in it, so the story goes VERY quickly, going from plot point to plot point to plot point as you would expect in a theater production.

Personally as a fan of the series I enjoyed the book a lot, I loved the characters, and the story. And I went in with basically no knowledge of it or what would happen besides that it was a script to a play, and I didn't expect anything more than that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_288?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=288&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

M. Arends","but I was delighted. I enjoy reading plays","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","ATTENTION -- SPOILERS AHEAD

As a Harry Potter fan, but also as an actor and director of stage plays, I was thoroughly entertained by this script.  I know a lot of HP fans are upset that this isn't a novelization of the play, but I was delighted.  I enjoy reading plays, and finding new materials to perform and direct.  When this play is available for amateur productions, it will be on my list.

I actually found the time-turner aspect of the story a lot of fun.  Yes, the HP world has shown us before that time travel is a closed loop... but we also only saw that from a few hours point of view in the third book... this one plays the time travel aspect going back 20 some odd years... and even 40 years at one point.  It's the same premise that was used in the Back to the Future series.  When what is supposed to happen doesn't happen, what are the consequences?  You end up with alternate time-lines, and until the loop is closed and the things that were supposed to happen actually happen, everything will be slightly off from what you knew before.  When it first happens in our play, the world as our young heroes (and make no mistake, the true stars of this story are Harry's son Albus, and his best friend Draco's son Scorpious) is different.  Not a lot different, but enough to have wiped out one family they knew... Showing that when even small, subtle things don't happen like they were supposed to, changes are made for both good, and ill.  Their second trip back in time tries to undo some of the damage done by the first trip, and still complete what they believe is their mission... but this one goes even worse than the first trip back.  It's an upside world, and, as an actor, I find that a brilliant challenge to play.  How do you take a character so well known, and turn them upside down so the core of who they are is the same, but their experiences are different, and subsequently the choices they made.

I look forward to seeing the stage show when it comes to the US... and eventually look forward to tackling this story as an actor/ director.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I loved how traveling through time created the new problem. And how voldemort had a daughter, excellent. I always knew that Albus was a slytherin since James was teasing him about it. I thought that even though it had a few flaws, overall it was great. A few things I would have changed was seeing more of Albus and scorpious school time. I mean, I knew it was written as a play, and they might not have had time to add that. But in the book, maybe they could have added something more. Otherwise, I think it was a really good story, and I could follow the plot really well.

But really","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, J. K Rowling, Jack Thorne, & John Tiffany.
“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a play based on a story by J. K. Rowling, but written by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany for the stage. Set in the present, Harry, now a father of three is struggling with his relationship to his youngest son, Albus Serverus. Harry, it turns out, is not quite the perfect parent. But really, who is? Albus, in my view is a pretty typical teenager, unhappy and embarrassed by his famous father. In a misguided attempt to win his father’s approval, Albus and his best bud Scorpius Malfoy get themselves in a real pickle. As always, friendship is at the heart of any Harry Potter story, and I loved that the friendship between Albus and Scorpius was a strong factor in the plot. Scorpius is a delight and has some great scene-stealing lines. I don’t view this play as Harry Potter #8. It’s really just a short story that’s been turned into a play. I know there is a lot of outrage by some fans, who feel this work falls short of Rowling’s best, but I quite enjoyed the play; how could I not? It allowed me the opportunity to visit Hogwarts and all my favorite characters again.
Highly recommended for Potter fans everywhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_450?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=450&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I'm a big fan of the original HP series too.  We won't go into how many times I have read the series, because it's a lot.  And here are my two cents.  This newest installment isn't a HP novel, and it doesn't read like one.  It's not even by J K Rowling, though her name appears on the cover.  However, I still enjoyed the story.  It was interesting to read Harry as an adult, struggling with his teenage child.  The play does feel a bit like fanfiction in spots--the time turners, the alternate universes--but at least it's fanfiction endorsed by JKR.  I enjoyed the story, and reading it made me miss the Golden Trio so much that I now need to re-read Books 1-7 for the umpteenth time!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_251?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=251&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Having high expectations, even though I knew it wasn't solely written by JKR, I read it in one day.

The way I describe it as such: while it's a great story, it's not the same. The flow and way the characters act do not correlate with the original books. You can tell that JKR didn't write a lot of it, it just doesn't have her flair (her imagination is there,  but character development was very much lost).

Cano","I eagerly suck up any additional stories or writings I can from ...","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2016","I feel I must start this review by saying that I am a die hard Harry Potter fan. I have all the books on audio and listen to them on repeat on a daily basis. They are my ""background noise"" or ""white noise"". I can quote whole sections at a time with Jim Dale as he reads it. I eagerly suck up any additional stories or writings I can from JK about the wizarding world and for that reason alone I love the play. With that being said, I am disappointed by the obvious lack of JK's skill in this play. It is obvious that it was written by someone else and only approved by her. There is a lack of detail in the storyline and more flat out bashing you over the head with information. The story also seemed rushed as compared to the books. This might be because it was meant to be enjoyed as a play and not as a book, but I found it to be a little disappointing. From this point on I warn you of spoilers!!!

SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT

The story picks up at platform 9 3/4  19 years later. Already I am annoyed that some lines are spoken by the wrong characters, but maybe I am the only one that picks up on that.  Albus becomes best friends with Scorpius, Scorpius and Albus become best friend, Albus and Scorpius are attached at the hip, inseparable friends... We get it. They bash you over the head with it. Unlike JK, who let's you discover character development through character behavior, these guys flat out tell you over and over and over again. I found it a little insulting, but maybe it comes across different in the play. I hated the lady that pushes the trolley. They changed her from a human witch into some strange bogart like morphing monster. It seemed out of line for the wizarding world and rather uninventive. I find it more likely that there is a spell or barrier that keeps the students on the train and not a monster cart lady that is as old as time.

I did like hearing about where Harry, Ron and Hermione are now. I find it perfectly natural that Ron is a huge jokester now. We all knew that he took over Fred's spot in the joke shop and with his wife being in a serious position like the minister of magic, it makes sense that he would balance out the relationship by being over the top funny. I also liked the way they portrayed Ginny and Harry's relationship. Ginny always did seem more insightful than Harry so when he flies off the handle at Albus it seems natural that she would comfort him and be able to reassure him that Al will forgive him.

I always thought there was something between Bellatrix and the Dark Lord so to hear they had a daughter seems entirely natural. There is easily enough time between when we see them at the beginning of book 7 (July so probably already pregnant but not showing) and when the snatchers bring Harry to the Malfoy’s for her to have had a baby.

Over all, I am glad to have further information on where everyone is now, but I am disappointed in many parts of the plot, the way it was written and the lack of JK’s input. This won't be something I listen to on repeat, but I will likely still read it once a year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

At first, the play structure distracted me, but before long I didn't even notice it. I think my only issue with it can't be helped. Because it is a play, it's considerably shorter than a normal Harry Potter book. I think one of the best things about those books is that you can get fully engrossed in the world and stay a while. The Cursed Child is so condensed in comparison. It's still a full story; you're not left hanging. It's just not quite the all-consuming experience that Potter fans are used to. The story line is fun, though.

IT IS A PLAY. YOU ARE LUCKY YOU EVEN GET TO READ IT!","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2017","All I'm seeing is people complaining about the format. YES. IT IS A PLAY. YOU ARE LUCKY YOU EVEN GET TO READ IT!

Seriously! When I first heard about the play coming out I was depressed because, realistically, I didn't think I would ever be able to see it.  So, the fact that I get to read the script is a pretty great thing.

It may also be easier for me, given I was in a lot of plays and musicals when I was younger, so I'm used to the format. The book actually gives a lot more detail than most scripts do, so it really doesn't take too much imagination to create the scene in your mind.

Anyway, overall the story started a bit slow, but picked up for me in Act 3. There are a lot of previous scenes and events from the first books incorporated, which adds a nice nostalgia aspect.

I hope they eventually record one of the performances - I'd love to see it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I was very pleasantly surprised.  It took a few chapters to get past the fact its written in play form, but once that happened I really, really enjoyed it.  I am a big Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to the release.  I see many people leaving negative comments and don't understand.  If they read the description of the book you would know what it was you were ordering.  One, its states its written as a play, Two that JK Rowling assisted in writing it, not that she wrote the whole thing.  No one should say they were deceived.  Descriptions are listed for a reason.  Anyway....  I enjoyed this book and will keep it safely with my collection.  My suggestion is to read with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.

Heiden","Give it a try","Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019","I almost didn't read this because of all the horrible reviews, but I'm glad I did. I would have preferred it in novel form and not as a play, but I was able to get over it. The main complaint I read in other reviews was that the characters weren't written like they are in the other Harry Potter books. While I can certainly see their point, I truly felt that the characters were only different as all adults are different than we were as teens. From 17 (the age Harry is in Deathly Hallows) to 40, most people change significantly. Plus, once you get married and have kids.....it changes you. So, taking that into account, I felt that the characters were written true to form. Was it as good as any of the original books? No. But it was still a good, quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As i read it i could envision the play before my eyes and it will be an amazing play in London. *SPOILER* that being said, It's not nearly as good as the novels, and i did think the time turner plot was a bit cheesy and interferes with info from the 7 novels, and that was admittedly dissapointing. But I knew that being a play script it would need to be condensed and fast. I feel that the reviews giving 1 or 2 stars are disappointed because it is not like the 7 novels, which it isn't.  This script does not come close to the depth of story and characters in the novels. It is a play! To sum up, if you approach the book as it is, a script not an 8th novel, and accept it wont be as good, you should not be disappointed. A great addition to my harry collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rogers","Nice to extend the Harry Potter line, but nothing like the originals.","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2017","I'll preface this by saying, I'm not a literary genius by any stretch of the imagination.  I enjoy reading, and thoroughly enjoyed the original Harry Potter books.  That being said, I enjoyed this ""book""/playscript for what it was... just an added story to the Harry Potter storyline.  Nothing particularly special, no sense of continued wonder that was built through the original books.  I think that's one of the things I loved about the original books, there a constant sense of ""ooooh, where is this going next?"" and general speculation from book to book.  This was more of a short story, that didn't have that sense of wonder for me.  It told a pretty good story, but it definitely began and ended for me.

It took me a while to write this review.  I think after reading the Deathly Hallows, my imagination came up with an idea of what would happen to Harry and the rest of the gang.  Where they would go, and what they would do.  This book destroyed that, and I think that gave an immediate negative bias toward the story.  I had expectations that weren't met, but that shouldn't weigh in on whether it was a good story or not.  Here I am a year later, and I can say I did enjoy the story.  If you have similar thoughts about what happened to Harry and the gang after the Deathly Hallows, let it go before reading this.... read it as objectively as possible, and let it sit for a while before you really judge it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A script is a bit different than a book and the reader must realize this. Still, the author did an excellent job of portraying the characters without the benefit of giving us their thoughts. The only thing that bothered me is we are never told why Ron is managing the joke shop and no mention is made of George, the one who owned the joke shop. Is he no longer around; the readers are never told?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I did miss the wonderful flow of Rowling's story-telling, but the plot of this book was pure Rowling. The characters from the original Harry Potter series, although now adults, stay true to their well, character. Most of the story centers on the 'next generation.' Following Harry's kids, especially the one named after two former heads of Hogwarts, begins a little slowly but picks up the pace as the story moves along. As Albus Severus Potter heads back to Hogwarts, he resents his famous father and the expectations that come with his bloodline. He finds a friend in an unlikely student from the Slytherin house. As Albus seeks to make his own mark, he time-travels back to an earlier time. The affect of simple changes shows Albus the importance of some of the things he has resented most about his lineage. I could not put this book down.

Because it's a screenplay, it's in script format and it has more jarring and sudden changes than a novel or movie. If you're comfortable with this style, it's a good story. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of a book or movie, it's very linear and has a single story line with only one or two very short side threads.

Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, I think it safe to say that the major interpersonal conflict in the play's plot could have been established much more quickly; the beginning I found tedious and repetitive. Once this was out of the way, however, the pace moves along quite nicely. There are flashbacks to the books/films which are brief enough not to slog things down, but that, as a fan, I found delightful. A major event in one of the books/films is a primary vehicle for plot advancement here; this is done quite well, when it could have easily been a retreading disaster.

That being said, of the two main characters, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, the former, though the main figure, is wooden and, frankly, not that interesting. Scorpius is the real scene-stealer; he's quirky, extremely likable, and much more real than his counterpart. He truly made the play for me.

Like the books themselves, much is predictable here. One can see immediately who the truly menacing character will turn out to be; the ""true meaning"" of the curse over the child is patently obvious (to everyone but those on stage). And when, oh when, will Ron Weasley's character be allowed to be anything more than comic relief? Still, if you love the series, this book will grab you at least by Act Two, and provide you a fun, engaging, and entirely worthwhile experience. At first, I felt prepared for disappointment. By its finish, I was psyched for the inevitable film -- and the next installment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling. Had it been written by just J.K., it would have been better. As it is, the thing is good, but not the great it could have been. Throughout, it leaves you asking: ""why would Harry's kid want to do such a thing?"", and it never supplies an answer. To show daddy up? To declare independence? To....what?

""To crate phony TV episode like drama"" is all I can think of. So much of it revolves around going into the past...with no valid reason for doing so. Still, what there is is well written, and interesting. I don't regret having made the purchase, or spent the time to read it, but it did not cost a lot, either, and it was short. I recommend it to Harry Potter fans, with the warning that it is not quite what they may expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I enjoyed the plot, and as it progressed the writing was fleshed out better.

Particularly earlier in the book, however, it was choppy, not ""deep"" enough, and negatively changed in ways from the HP 7 Epilogue, but these issues were mainly just distracting.  More concerning, the wording of sentences by characters well known across seven books was flat and not consistent with those characters as children or teachers, mainly in the early scenes. This is particularly noticeable with Hermione and Ron, where neither portrayed a personality early on as adults in the script,  as mature and animated as their child selves in the books. Professor McGonagall came across a bit silly and flakey in some scenes, something she never would have been accused of in any of the 7 novels.

Those things aside, the play developed very well, in my opinion, and had the right flavor of twists and turns in the play as the novels did.  The ideas and family bonds, as well as the strife, was consistent with what you might see between parents and children with the backgrounds they have, or stigmas they might carry due to association.

All in all, it was a good script and I think as improv and and general response is given to the viewings, the stage play will correct many of the faults seen in this version of the script book.  I will definitely endeavor to see it when it comes to the US.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","","One person found this helpful"

In this new installment, Albus struggles with his famous father’s legacy.  With his BFF Scorpio Malfoy, he schemes to steal a time turner to go back to the Triwizard Tournament to save Cedric Diggory.  Two inexperienced adolescent wizards playing with time is bound to go bad, and when they change history, mayhem ensues.  The time travel device could have gotten confusing, but I think it was well done here.  When the boys realize the consequences of their meddling, the adults get involved to try to prevent Voldemort’s victory.

Was this book a necessary addendum to the stories we already know and love?  Not really.  Was it entertaining and nice to revisit our favorite characters?  You bet!  Though it wasn’t as thoroughly engrossing and endearing as Rowling’s novels, it was still a fun return to the wizarding world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_489?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=489&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Still, it had a perfect mix of mystery, misery, and heart warming moments, making it a much appreciated Harry Potter revival.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Without spoiling it for anyone, if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Yes, it's a play which means you aren't going to get the amazing depth of imagery that JK provides. I thoroughly enjoyed envisioning I was an audience member as the play went on, at the edge of my seat with my heart in the pit of my stomach. The story gave me everything I could want from what is to be the final story in the Harry Potter world. I laughed. I cried.

We get a glimpse into what the wizardry world is like after Voldemort is defeated. We also see how the characters we watch grow up in front of our very eyes while reading the books is like in the older age. It was exciting to also learn some of the new Potter and Weasley clan. At the end of the original series ending book, we see Draco Malfoy begin a transformation from his family traditional view of people. We get to see his son pick up that mettle and transverse the name into a better light. The writing format is total different than most people are use to because of it being constructed for a play. But once you figure the cadence and get a good grove going while reading, you fall back into the world everyone has loved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_257?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=257&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A character and a series that defines a generation. Having grown up alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the Harry Potter series has been near and dear to my heart since I first picked up The Sorcerer's Stone. So when I learned that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was going to be published for us to read, I was both happy and hesitant - happy to see what more might be done and hesitant to have the ending from Deathly Hallows changed in my mind.

As Harry and Ginny's son Albus first attends Hogwarts, the apprehension that Albus feels stems from his trying to live up to his father's reputation and expectations. When Albus befriends Scorpious Malfoy and gets sorted into Slytherin, he becomes more and more distant from his father, and Harry's temper eventually gets the best of him. When the opportunity arises that Albus can change the past, he takes it, not realizing the drastic and dark changes it could spark. Albus's actions bring back the pain in Harry's scar, leading him to fear the return of unspeakable evil and confront the consequences of his and his son's actions.

A play is a different beast than a novel, and it's always a touchy subject to revisit a cultural staple that played an integral part in people's childhoods, but this play that visits the famed 19 years later in the Harry Potter world does a good job of developing the characters, both new and old alike so that it still has that Harry Potter feel. Events took place a little too rapidly for my preference, and it was filled with areas in the plot that raised more questions than it answered, but it was an entertaining foray into life after we left the story.

Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","","9 people found this helpful"

Rowling's imagination. While this ""rehearsal script"" for a theatrical production (first stage in London on July 30, 2016) is frenetically paced and (at least on the printed page) lacks much of the novels' spirit of whimsy--their rich depth of colorful, if often superfluous detail--readers do get to reconnect with many of the most-beloved characters in the series once again, and there are a few interesting (and essential) new characters as well.  Young Albus Severus Potter finds it increasingly difficult to live in his famous father's shadow; Hogwarts for him is no Hogsmeade holiday, only his friendship with the shy and lonely Scorpius Malfoy offers consolation, and Scorpius is himself dogged by dark rumors about his parentage. Mischief and rebellion are in the air like a swarm of dementors, but this mischief won't be quite so easy to manage when the two friends endeavor to change history.

That's the story in its broadest outline. The plot of ""Cursed Child"" draws on the earlier books, most heavily ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"", but a thorough familiarity with the entire series is assumed from the beginning. This may be problematic for some Potter neophytes, while ""purists"" who claim to adore The Boy Who Lived but can't abide the notion of his ever growing up or changing (as real people so often do) will find a fair bit to complain about--but don't they always?

Yet, by and large, the source material is skilfully mined for its 'quantum possibilities', the resulting story is often quite clever and, in moments, moving, poignant, and insightful. Rowling has once again given us an engaging magical tale that is also a compelling story of relationships (fathers and sons, friendship and love, family past and individual destiny) human emotion, growth and the understanding that comes with experience and maturity.

Recommended with the caveats noted above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It is a play based on a short story that J K Rowling wrote.  Just like the Potter movies change the plot and skip over massive sections of the novels, a play must have it’s own pace and style of writing.  It can’t cover all of the glorious detail the books could.
For me the play script was a lovely short story, sort of like another couple of chapters at the end of The Deathly Hallows.
If you didn’t enjoy the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, then this play is not of you.  It is hard to see the our beloved Hogwarts friends grow old and boring, I found that a little depressing at the end of such a wonderful series. This play helped me understand that it is OK.

In this story we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the Potter and friends' progeny, along with an exciting page turning adventure.  It’s use of the time turner is a plot device that allows us to view the ‘greatest hits’ from the book series.  I imagine the crowd cheering each time we see an old favorite character make an appearance, like an encore after a fantastic concert.

As a huge Potter fan, the play script helped me realize I have had enough of Harry and friends as adults. I realized that with adulthood Harry could no longer have the same sort of adventures his character had in the novels, he has kids and responsibilities.  It would be against his big hearted character to put those things at risk.  And after reading the first few chapters, I didn’t want him to.  I was more interested in what the kids were up to; they were interesting because of their well established back stories and I wanted to read more about them.  If you had asked me before I read The Cursed Child, I would have told you the opposite, I didn't want to read about the kids, I wanted more from Harry, Ron and Hermione.

If there is more of the Potter universe out there in JK’s mind, I’ll be happy to just know that Harry is still existing in it and that he is still an imperfect human, who makes bad decisions as a parent as he did as a kid, but is still pure of heart and every bit the hero from the novels. But if the adventures in that magical world continue without him, I will be delighted to read every last word.
I really hope this is a bridge to new adventures in Rowling’s magical world, it successfully established new Hogwarts' characters that I care about and want to see more of.  I struggled with the idea that the new Potter universe movie, 'Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them' will take place years before most of the familiar characters were even born, because I thought I needed our three original heroes, but now I am hopeful that Rowling’s magic will be more than enough!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Having said that - I like it better than her usual writing. I only give it 4 stars because if you're reading it hoping to get the Harry Potter/J.K.Rowling feeling again.....I don't think you will get that. However - If you're reading it to read a really well-written, interesting story about a world you care deeply for......you will get that. I absolutely loved it! There was a more grown-up, philosophical feeling to this book than there was to the HP books, which I liked better than the HP books, but that's because that kind of thing really appeals to me.

It's a beautiful mix of nostalgia and new characters that will make you laugh, cry, and wish we lived in the wizarding world. There are two major differences between reading this script and reading the Harry Potter books. First, it is a very quick read. I read it in about 3 or 4 hours, so about an hour per act to read through. Second, even though there are stage directions, a lot of the action is left to your imagination. Fortunately, if you are like me and read all of the Harry Potter books and watched the movies, it is easy to imagine where the scenes are taking place and what all of the actions look like. I highly recommend this whether you plan on seeing the play or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_288?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=288&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A script is still a story but it requires some imagination. In addition, scripts also come in book form. Anyone who is complaining that they can't believe it is a script needs to remember that is the way it was always going to be.

I am a hardcore fan. Have the books, have the audio books and just this year I went to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios. Now, I did not have a hard time reading it. I loved the character development and the real struggle between Harry and Albus. I always imagined that to be a child of Harry Potter would be immensely difficult. As an angsty teen, Albus displayed more realistic emotions and I love that he is the opposite of his father. I also find that the main characters from the original series developed EXACTLY as they should.

Many of the complaints on here say that you can't recognize Harry or the other characters. To that I have to ask: what adult in their 30's or 40's can say they are the same as their 17 year old selves? Harry is a father, that comes with a whole new set of challenges that can't be magicked away or solved with a quick conversation. The development between Draco and Harry is the way things should be, when you are older you don't always hold the same grudges.

To sum up: the script will read like a script and yes reading nothing but dialogue can be difficult. But keep in mind that if you know the originals as well as you think, creating imagery in your head shouldn't be hard. Remember that these characters have changed in 19 years and should be looked at as they are now. It's a great read and don't discount it. Now to the spoilers.

Spoiler!!!!!!!!

Of course Hermione would be minister of magic, she was always destined to be that powerful. Ron is still Ron with his fun loving goofy spirit who is steadfastly loyal. Ginny has grown wise and not so much the meek Harry Potter worshipper she once was.

I can see how Harry would have a kid in Slytherin and that they would be best friends with Draco's son.

While some feel that the plot with Voldemorts daughter is far fetched; I implore everyone to rethink the relationship with Bellatrix and Voldemort.

To sum up again: the script will read like a script and yes reading nothing but dialogue can be difficult. But keep in mind that if you know the originals as well as you think, creating imagery in your head shouldn't be hard. Remember that these characters have changed in 19 years and should be looked at as they are now. It's a great read and don't discount it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_468?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=468&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

The beginning was a bit slow as they set up the characters of Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. The second half bumped up my opinion of the book considerably once we got into the meat of the plot. It just took awhile to get there. Basically, Albus Severus is trying to go back in time to right a wrong of his father's but ends up messing up the fabric of time. I really enjoyed seeing how small changes altered the current reality so much. The friendship between the two boys was really great and reminded me of the trio in its strength and resolve. Some of the older generation felt a bit out of character at the beginning but I feel like the characters kind of found themselves again but the end of the book.

This isn't really just another Harry Potter book so don't expect it to be like the other ones. Go in with an open mind to a slightly different writing style, an entirely different format, and new characters. It is a good read but some die hard Harry Potter fans might be a bit let down if they were really looking for a direct continuation of the seven books JK Rowling wrote about Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I love Harry Potter and it will forever be in my heart and I cried so much when the story ended. I'll admit, in the beginning I thought it was dumb and I was angry, but as the story progressed, I got more into it. I think it's a kind of what if story. What if Voldemort had a child? What if he had survived? It gave  the readers a view of this and I thought it was awesome. I expected a whole series to come after this, but they really summed everything up greatly in that one book.

As it is written in a play format, it took me a while to get used to reading in that style of writing. Harry and his friends were just as they normally were but the children were written in completely opposite form from their parents. It was great reading this story and seeing the many changes in HP, Hermione, Ron and Draco as they were parents. Also many surprises that were found in this book as well - it had me slack-jawed and fast turning the pages to make sure that what I read wasn't real (hint - the alternate reality with no HP).

I think it was a pretty good story, but it's definitely a script of a play.  Everyone should know that by now, but judging by what I've read in some negative reviews, some people aren't used to reading plays.  Reading a play is a VERY different experience than reading a novel.  Yes, the story moves fast and there isn't as much depth.  That's because the whole story must be performed in a few hours.  You also have to be willing to put a whole lot of your imagination into reading it.  Thankfully, we're all very familiar with the world of Harry Potter. Also, honestly, we're missing out by not getting to see the staging.  A read play is never going to have the impact of either a well-written novel or a well-performed play. It's one of the reasons so many students struggle to read Shakespeare in English class, but then they go see a play and suddenly ""get"" why he's the greatest playwright in the English language.  Even though most people knew it was a script, I think they didn't really know (or remember from school) how different reading a play is.

Mild spoiler warning!

I also don't get why some people flat out refuse to believe that Harry might be a bad father.  He would want to be a good father, to be sure, but not all good people are good parents.  Especially when you consider that Harry has undergone a ton of trauma and has never really had a father.  One of the compelling things about Harry as a character in the other books was the fact that he was normal: he wasn't super-smart or the best wizard, he was flawed, and he sometimes made bad decisions which had real consequences.  The fact that this same character would grow up to be a man who isn't the best parent or spouse makes complete sense to me.

I get why some people are not thrilled with the Time Turner aspect of the story, but I think it was fun.  They really explored what changing time might do and how that all works.  It was taking one relatively minor plot point from the novels and playing with the idea a little more.  The alternate universes, so to speak, were also interesting to me.

Overall, I think this is a fun read, especially if you don't expect it to be something it's not.  Would I have preferred an eight novel?  Absolutely, but we've known for a while that we weren't going to get that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_482?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=482&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

Though one piece of the plot was fairly predictable, I still enjoyed it immensely. It in no way tops the the 7 book series but as I said above it was nice to have more to the story.

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  I read the book in a couple of hours on the day after I received it.  This story was written in play form and does not have the in depth descriptions that the original seven books have.  It picks up with the story nineteen years after the defeat of Voldemort, with Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione taking their children to King's Cross Station to put them on the train to Hogwarts. Then it tells about the adventures of Harry and Ginny's son Albus.
  The story is not of the same writing quality as the original seven books but it is a different form (play) and if performed, would be fleshed out a bit.  I enjoyed reading it.  I am interested in reading anything Harry Potter and hope there are more  books, plays,  etc. coming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

Love you amazon!

I just finished reading it, and it's really good, though I can't see it as the ""official eighth book"". For me, it's a really well written fanfiction. I can tell JK Rowling was not responsible for the actual writing, because at times the characters are a bit ott and not quite canon. They don't always sound like the Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the book. And Draco Malfoy is far too cheerful and friendly with the trio (even calling them by their first names). Professional McGonagall is also way out of character. The ending was kind of rushed and also too good to be true (everything fell into place all at once), but otherwise it was a cute, funny and heartwarming read. Like I said, it's a really well written fanficition, but definitely not the eighth Harry Potter book!

I would recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, but don't read it with too many expectations! The storyline is definitely not as complex as the Harry Potter series, but if you're looking for a light, enjoyable read to pass time, then you'll like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I was instantly drawn in and the magic never ended for me. This was a quick read and definitely different because it's written as a play.

Rowling's approval to produce it on stage. All good fun. Just not Harry Potter as we know it. MILD SPOILER. When Hermione took on Snape's personality, though, they just about lost me. In no way, never, ever, ever, would Hermione turn into that of a bitter waspish witch (meant in derogatory terms here, pardon), even out of unrequited love. Never. Not our champion of justice and equality for all. This was the most glaring flaw I could find. Oh, and I STILL can't figure out who the Cursed Child is. Delphi, I suppose. But it just doesn't feel like the answer. It will much better play than it did a book, hopefully.
SERIOUS SPOILER. Voldemort and Bellatrix, though. Eww. I once wrote a Mugglenet editorial on that very point (sadly, lost now), but still. The very idea.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The time turner plot becomes a bit convoluted and overlong, but the characterizations make up for it. Scorpius is by far the best character in the play. Albus is a brooding, sullen and somewhat annoying teenager. Harry's clashes with him are believable. Harry could certainly be all of those things himself and at a similar age.  Hermione is probably what I pictured as an adult. Ron is ill served here and his daughter Rose seems like an alternate version of the character in the epilogue.

Did I have a lot of little and, yes, some big concerns with some of the content? Sure. But I had to remind myself - as I hope others will as well when picking up a copy - is that this is not a work meant to be read but to be watched! Therefore a lot of the writing will seem weak to those who don't regularly read play scripts or screenplays - it's a completely different format that is not generally meant for the larger public to read. I'm sure that watching the live performance, with all the bells and whistles (and there are many in this piece) would totally distract from many of the things readers have grievances with.

The play is not really about Harry or Albus or Hogwarts and magic, but about families and their complicated dynamics. Although sometimes coming across as a Do's and Don'ts for parenting teens, I thought it was an incredibly sweet and charming play. Like the 7 novels that came before it, the play harkens back to the past to inform the future so it gives plenty to those HP fans who have missed the whole cast of characters and Hogwarts while keeping the narrative firmly planted in the frame of this new story. I think it's worthwhile if you're someone looking for a little something to assuage your Harry Potter cravings. My mom and I always read the Harry Potter series together, so I'm excited for my mom to read it and to be able to discuss it with her.

That being said, ***MAJOR SPOILERS***** I was a little disappointed that the limitations of what a Time-Turner can do were completely changed - if not altogether abolished - for the sake of this plot and not at all addressed within the play. And I didn't really feel that the time travel aspect was even necessary. Also I felt like many of the time references ""not since twenty-two years"", ""not in twenty years"", etc. were inconsistent - which is a minor complaint and would easily be overlooked when watching the play. However, I wouldn't be able to overlook the alternate reality created by Albus and Scorpious on their second attempt to alter the past was graphically horrific but lacked all the high stakes that the imagery required. The play described torture akin to or worse than many accounts of past, recent, and ongoing real world genocides but treated them all very lightly since, you know, the gang will correct the timeline anyway, right? But it was hard to read these scenes without feelings of intense frustration at their treatment.

I was also a little disturbed by the way that the character Delphi actively flirted with and otherwise encouraged Albus to fall for her and believe he had a chance at a romantic relationship with her in order to manipulate him. Because this is also too real, in my opinion, to just brush aside and not address further. In fact, the opposite is done and it's turned into a joke - first with Ron claiming he's glad to see the love potion he gave Albus was put to good use, then again when Albus is later teased by Scorpious for his interest in an older woman. But frankly, Delphi's manipulation of a teen boy's feelings and fluctuating hormones is disgusting and no different from the child sexual abuse so many young boys experience because of the narrative that ""boys can't be violated"" or that ""women can't be perpetrators"". And one might say, ""Well she was evil!"" Sure, she was, but her characterization as an evil villain had nothing to do with her role as a (however temporary) child predator. It was really gross and I wish Albus's feelings of having been used should have been further validated by someone. That's just my opinion.

With all that said, I want to reiterate that I did really enjoy reading this script and I can't wait for the opportunity to see it performed live!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_431?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=431&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Right off I will say that I think anyone who moans and groans that this feels like a work of fanfiction really has more issues with the fact that it is a stage play more than anything.  Apparently, they've never read a stage play before, or HP fanfiction.  I've read HP fanfiction and I've yet to find any that was halfway decent.  (If you have, please send me the links because I wouldn't mind reading them.  I'm open to new scenarios.)  The only main thing in the play that is like fanfiction is Delphi which, duh, like I didn't see that being put in here.  You can't use that and compare this to fanfiction.  This is a stage play, plain and simple.  I, personally, have done drama in the past and performed plays so this type of writing did not bother me in the least.  I understood many aspects of the story would not be told since you are essentially cramming a very large story into a three hour play.  Hello?  You can't go into every stinking detail.  Some say the characters were too one or two dimensional.  It's a play!  The actors add dimension.  Some cry that this is not the Ron or Harry or Hermione that they know and love so it must have been written by someone else.  Wow.  Okay, first off, it was technically written by someone else.  It was Rowling's concept but actually written by someone else because she is not a playwright.  Go figure, she had to get an actual playwright to write a play based on her idea.  Hmm, crazy concept, I know.  This is actually what happens ALL THE TIME.  Second, it has been 19 years later.  They have grown up, gotten married, have careers, have families.  These life events change people, as does two decades.  For crying out loud.  Should she have written another novel?  Sure, but she didn't.  She wasn't even going to publish this, but so many people begged because not everyone could make it over to London to watch the play.  How very nice of you, Mrs. Rowling.  I personally, appreciate your kindness for publishing this play.  Thank you.  For you critics out there, you knew that going into this.  It wasn't a secret and nobody tricked you.  Move on.  She is publishing the ""Fantastic Beasts"" screenplay but I am worried that with everyone throwing tantrums about getting a gift they knew they were getting she might just cut us off completely.  Sure, there were a few things that were inconsistent with the HP universe, but have you ever read a series written over decades?  There are always inconsistencies.  I don't put Rowling on some pedestal.  She is not immortal.  She has never put her name on something that she did not fully approve of so I firmly believe she signed off on this completely.  (It wasn't like James Patterson who writes two paragraphs and puts his name on a book.)  If she made a mistake or two it only means she is human.  Those of you out there demanding perfection 100% of the time need to admit yourself into an insane asylum because that is the only place where you will be able to have someone guarantee you will get everything exactly the way you want it every time you want it, with medication.  Before anyone gets their boxers in a bunch, I'm not attacking those who just didn't like the play.  We all have opinions.  However, there are actually people out there going psycho and DEMANDING that she write a new novel and calling her names and denouncing her work.  There have been statements of entitlement to a proper book.  We are not entitled to anything by a freaking author.  People have lost their minds.  Anyhoo, just wanted to clear that up so no one gets offended.  People tend to do that just a little too easy nowadays.

I thought this play was magical.  It transported me back almost ten years to a world I used to stay up at night drowning myself in.  It was wonderful to see everyone grown and how they adjust as parents with all the baggage they've undoubtedly taken with them through the years.  You know this is a one-play deal so you know it will end on a good note, but nonetheless, your heart starts beating faster not knowing if Albus and Scorpius will fix their mistakes and make everything right again.  Will Rowling pull a ""just kidding"" and crush our poor little souls like she did with Dumbledore and Fred and Sirius and Severus?  These thoughts flood your mind, and that's what makes a great story.  Wonderful.  Absolutely wonderful.

I enjoyed the story and thought it was well thought out and developed and it had enough twists to keep it interesting.  It is however a script and not a novel.  For those not used to reading scripts I imagaine they would find this a challenging read.  Much is left for actor's, director's interpretation in terms of emotion of the actor.  It also uses stage notation which if one is not used to reading would make the story more difficult to follow.  In all it is a play I hope to see a production of at some point, or a movie.  As a high school drama coach my thoughs were often about how difficult this play would be to stage and how difficult the effects would be to produce on stage.  I understand the British production has done a very good job of bringing the story to life.  The scrip could also easily be addapted to be a movie, and in some ways would be better suited that a movie production.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I'm a TOTAL Harry Potter nerd (to the point that it was the underlying theme at our wedding) but for so many of you who have not bought the book or read it yet I wanted to give you a view of what to expect without telling you any major plot parts.

So I'll begin with the fact that it is a play script, not a novel, so you have to read it differently. You have to stop and visualize what is going on in the scene because you don't get all the background you would usually get with a book. In the HP books, there was always a backstory, and you followed Harry and his friends through time. This play covers 4 years in 320 pages, so you are getting a glimpse and you have to fill in the gaps yourself. This is a new feeling if you are used to reading Rowling's usual work with all the detail and ""Easter Eggs"" within. I would say that it is more like the next movie rather than the next book.

The Cursed Child is a glimpse into Harry, his family, and his friends' future. It gives you an extension of what happens next, but it is not as fulfilling as reading one of the HP novels. That being said, if you are truly a PottHead and have been as desperate as I have for more of the HP universe, you will enjoy this read. I would love to see it as a play, in live action, because I think it would come together nicely on stage.

Like I said, approach it knowing that it is more like a 9th movie rather than an 8th book. You don't get the depth in a play that you get with novels. But I highly suggest it to anyone who is looking for a Harry Potter fix. I finished within 24 hours, and I don't regret it at all. Some VERY intriguing and exciting plot twists along the way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_478?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=478&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

A must-have for Potter fans:","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2016","Excellent play! No, it's not quite the same as reading the original series, but it's a really well-done supplement to them. The story draws you in pretty quickly and you definitely get emotionally invested in the characters. Will it be your absolute favorite? Probably not, but it's definitely worth the read.
Pros:
- New characters are incorporated into the HP universe pretty seamlessly.
- All events, locations, etc. are accurate to the original books. No changes/liberties taken to ""make it work"" with a new story.
- Modified perspective! While Harry plays a very large part in the story, he's not the main character and he's not always seen in a favorable light.
- While being a continuation or sequel, this play deals with a lot of characters and events from the original series. The events of the past play a central role in the current plot and important characters from the originals add depth or at least thoughts/opinions that weren't given the first time around or, better still, given in retrospect.
- Now that it's been 19 years since the events of the originals, some of the characters reflect on actions and circumstances of the past. It adds a new perspective because not all of them like who they were back then, nor think their actions were the best option. Hindsight's always 20/20, right?
- The physical book is great quality, comfortable holding while reading, and looks fantastic on the shelf with its predecessors.

Cons:
- This is a one-sitting read. Short and straight to the point. The plot flies by pretty quickly without lingering much on details.
- The style, being a play, leaves a lot to be desired as far as what characters may be thinking as opposed to what they are saying. Everything you know and learn and understand comes from dialogue only. Of course this is the nature of a play, but when you're accustomed to full novelization (as we Potter fans are) it's a bit lacking in unspoken emotion and imagery.
- One of the ""pros"" above was that this is a sequel that ties-in well with its predecessors. That is true, but there are moments while reading that feel almost TOO tied-in. That's to say that it feels forced sometimes; like certain people or events, etc. were put in there purely to have something recognizable in a new story.
- While J.K. Rowling undoubtedly had a large part in creating the story/plot, you can definitely tell that she didn't pen the words herself. That's not to say it isn't well-written (because it is), but there are subtleties, word choices, phrasings, etc. that show another writer's imprint. You may not even notice these subtleties at first, but the overall ""feel"" is different. Again: different does not mean bad.

All in all, I'm glad I've got this play in my Potter collection and it was an enjoyable read. I recommend it to anyone who has read the complete series and is itching for more. I don't, however, recommend it to a ""casual"" fan - a.k.a. someone who has not read the entire series or who was never that emotionally invested in the story. This play relies very heavily on the assumption that you know all the details of the original series off the top of your head. Without that knowledge, a lot of the actions/events/etc. wouldn't make much sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A little mote time couldnt have hurt but was not necessary.  This story has a lot of good in, and is a worthy edition for any potter fan.  It is not the 10/10 that the books are, but its not bad.  There are some silly or cliche time travel things (minor issues) but no biggy--the story is about characters--and how past has affected them and thats the endgame and as a play, is the sole purpose.  4 stars, 7.5/10.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

If I’m being honest, I never originally intended on reading this story. I adore Harry Potter, I just felt that the story was better left as is after the epilogue of the Deathly Hallows. But then my book bestie morphed into the pushiest book pusher that ever pushed and suddenly I found myself having already finished and wondering how I ever thought I could not read this. Setting aside all the vast amounts of criticism this has received (i.e. this isn’t written by Rowling, it reads like fan-fic, it’s not even a book but a screenplay) it ended up being more than I could have ever hoped for.

“Hogwarts will be the making of you, Albus. I promise you, there is nothing to be frightened of there.”

Taking us right back to the epilogue of the Deathly Hallows, we get to see Albus getting on his first train to Hogwarts. And his discussion with Harry regarding the possibility of him being placed in Slytherin. We’re not given the detailed account of his time spent at Hogwarts, but rather the generalized impression that Hogwarts isn’t quite the sanctuary for him that it was for his father. The comprehensive details of the world are also missing from the screenplay but for those of us who have already read the first seven books, that world is emblazoned upon our minds and no rehashing of details are necessary for us to fully comprehend each and every scene.

Cursed Child manages to smoothly connect many major plot points from the original novels: the infiltration of the Ministry of Magic by Harry, Ron, and Hermione (Deathly Hallows, book 7), the Tri-Wizard tournament and Cedric’s death (Goblet of Fire, book 4), time turners (Prisoner of Azkaban, book 3), the perpetual battle between good and evil, and the important father-son relationships that have been a focal point of this series from the beginning. It also makes a less than obvious point of showing how seemingly inconsequential deaths end up having a much larger impact in the grand scheme of things. With the help of a time turner, we’re shown snippets of how the world could have been with the simplest of changes. The variation of possibilities was both shocking and horrifying. What I most enjoyed was how this wasn’t simply a new set of adventures with a new set of characters but rather recognition of the fact that the actions of the past was not a given end to that story, but that they inevitably had an effect on the future of their own children.

Harry: “How do I protect my son, Dumbledore?”
Dumbledore: “You ask me, of all people, how to protect a boy in terrible danger? We cannot protect the young from harm. Pain must and will come.”

While we do see the original characters and what they have become 19 years later, the focal point is on their children, primarily Albus and Scorpius who become immediate friends on the Hogwarts Express. Albus has a severely strained relationship with his father, Harry, and has difficulty living up to not just the enormous importance of his father, of the great men he was named after, and because of the fact that he was in fact placed in Slytherin rather than his father’s house, Gryffindor. It’s easy to see from the original stories how understandable it would be for Harry to not be the perfect father, considering his own lack of a permanent father figure. He does what he feels is best even when it is quite clearly not best, and the scenes between the two are often painful and heartbreaking. Scorpius, son of Draco Malfoy, also suffers from a poor relationship with his father due the actions of his past as well as Draco’s own relationship with his father, Lucius.

In October of this year I decided to do an impromptu re-read of the Harry Potter series on audio. I have re-read books 1-3 numerous times but I tend to run out of steam and have never been able to re-read books 4-7. Well, I finally overcame my hangups and completed my first re-read of Goblet of Fire. Due to the majority of this story centering around the storyline from The Goblet of Fire I chose to do my second re-read of the year (ha) of Cursed Child since the storyline was still so fresh in my mind. It works extremely well if you treat it as a #4.5 book as well, granted, it’s vital to know the outcome of the series as a whole in order to fully appreciate how it ties everything together and illustrates the growth of these characters.

“Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.”

Yes, perfection is an impossibility, and while there were many things I would have personally changed, this still managed to hit all my Harry Potter feels as perfectly as possible. Cursed Child reinforced my love of both the original stories and characters by growing them in legitimate ways, it gave me new characters to love (primarily Scorpius <3), and it removed the stereotype associated with Slytherin house by showing that not all associated are necessarily evil. #slytherinpride","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_210?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=210&reviewerType=all_reviews","14 people found this helpful"

I have read each book (1-7) 4-5 times each.  I started reading them as an adult, so I did not grow up with them as many did, but they are some of my favorite books.  I was worried I would not like this script; that the story would not truly be under JK Rowling's ""umbrella"" or feel like her story/voice, and would disappoint.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  It took a little more work to imagine as it is a script, and I felt the characters were left very unexplored, even the ones we know so well and love. With the passage of time, they have all, as expected, changed and I think they (and we) were short changed by not having them flushed out more.  I am sure the actors playing these parts in London will bring a nuance and depth to the characters that you cannot feel or see by just reading lines; however, I do wish it was a book.  I think it is a really neat story that could have been done more justice in a book.  I do feel a bit cheated in that regard.  I wish she had taken the time to do it properly (as I see it).  I am happy to have purchased it and read it though, and I will do so again and again because I enjoyed the story that much.  Hopefully many of you will give it a chance,and find that the overall feel and direction of the story is very much fitting of the series and Rowling as I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_334?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=334&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I'm sure it's something to behold in person.

It came across to me, however, that some of the dialogue points were laid on thick (Dumbledore's painting is highly emotional, which doesn't fit into D's character at all).

It was also disappointing to see Hermoine, Ron and Ginny diluted to caricatures of their more nuanced characters.

It seems the playwright ignored the less is more approach in favor of over explaining certain emotional motifs in some misguided attempt at tapping the HP nostalgia cash cow.

I will say, Harry is well-rounded and makes for a somewhat-touching emotional arc in this play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_431?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=431&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It must be the most beautiful production.... I wouldn't even know HOW they could make it into a reality. I wish wish wish I could see it..... What a blast from the past! While I do feel this book felt a bit 'fan fictiony,' I actually really enjoyed it. I was open to not enjoying it and willing to give it a bad review if needed - I am always truthful and honest with my ratings on books. But - luckily I loved it:

The book takes place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and we follow Albus Potter, Harry's son, who is struggling to live up to the Potter name. There's a lot of conflicts in his life, from a hard relationship with his dad to his pretty grim Hogwarts experience - and so when something happens that means he could change the past and inevitably the future, he grasps the opportunity only to ROYALLY f*!k things up.

I am someone that never rereads a book. That said, I hadn't been swept into the Harry Potter world since I was a kid and I was really nervous that this book would ruin a major part of my childhood. Yes, I was one of those complete nerds who would be standing outside of the bookstore at midnight dressed as a witch, waiting for the release of the next book in the series..... don't judge me.

I'd tried my best to keep away from everyone else's opinions until I'd read it but some people had told me they were really disappointed - I still tried to go in with an open mind though. With that in mind, I really don't understand why people were disappointed in this book! I found it captivating, page-turning and thoroughly gripping. OK, the writing wasn't earth-shatteringly good but it's written in the form of a script and I think they did a damn good job at making it as good as it could be.

I enjoyed being reminded of certain things that happened in the original Harry Potter books that I'd long since forgotten about. I enjoyed catching up with the characters too (although I can never really remember Ron being quite so classically humorous.. I always thought of him as quite ingeniously sarcastic and dry rather than 'trying' to be funny). I am still not sure what I think about Draco's character, he changed the most out of everyone to me - a lot of character development which is always a good thing, but I liked him as the bad boy. Just my opinion.

The plot wasn't as mind-boggling as the original books, it was short and quick and had a direction all of its own and there is nothing wrong with that. You can never beat the original HP books - but I definitely think this book is worth a read nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_314?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=314&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Rowling (sure there is some dispute on how much she wrote) 4.5 out of 5 stars in my book review that I promise to not give any spoilers.  HP and the Cursed Child is an all around is a fun fast read for high school students and up.

I know there are a lot mixed review on this book, but I still say definitely give it a read.  Though, there are a few things that it is best to remember going into this book.  First, you have to remember that this book is a script. Scripts are different from your traditional novel.  To be honest, I forgot that at first.  The first 20 pages or so was a little frustrating b/c I wasn't getting the detail in the setting, characters, story development, etc.  However, after I remembered that little, but crucial, detail I really got immersed in the story.  I have always felt that it is too hard to compare the books to their movie counterparts.  They are different, and they each have different strengths.  I feel the same thing applies with a script to a novel.

There were several things that I really liked with HP and the Cursed Child.  I really liked reminiscing with the old characters.  I really liked seeing the story continue.  There are some awesome quotes/lines found in the story that I had to write down.  I'd love to share all of them with you, but I promised you no spoilers.  Therefore, I'll share just this one from Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. ""I, uh, I opened a book.  Something which has- in all my years on this planet- never been a particularly dangerous activity."" This quote makes my librarian book loving heart smile.  Even though Scorpius is not my favorite (I was never a Malfoy fan either), I LOVE this quote.

Now, it is true, and somewhat shocking that a Harry Potter book didn't earn a perfect 5 star rating.  Though, I've always been a tough grader and that doesn't change.  I'm not comparing the script to the other books b/c they are different (script vs. novel), but I am judging the book as part of the series and that is where it falters.

Since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a continuation of the story I was disappointed that the characters were not always consistent with who they were in the first 7 books.  Hermione was known for being clever in the original series, but I didn't think she was her consistent witty clever self in this book.  I felt there were inconsistencies with Ron and Harry's characters as well.  I don't want to give too much into why they were inconsistent b/c I don't want to spoil a single aspect of the story.  However, it is the inconsistencies with the characters that is the major reason for the less than perfect score.

I still thoroughly enjoyed reading the script book.  I found myself feeling many emotions in the reading.  I was incredibly happy. picking up the book, and concerned, worried, sad, curious, surprised, and more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","","","3 people found this helpful"

I wish this were a novel instead of a screenplay, and I also wish the antagonist was not Moldy-Voldy's kid. That is OOC to me. I can't see The Dark Lord, who was not only determined to not share magic, but also to not die, ever thinking he would need to possibly procreate.

Consequently it differs from the Harry Potter novels, because it is a script, not a book. That being said, all the whimsy, all the wonderful characters, the storytelling, the world of Harry Potter are there, and it is just as magical as the original books. I found the first act a bit hard to get into but by Act 2 I was hooked by the story. I have friends who have tickets to the play in London, all I can say is they will really enjoy it. If you are a Potter fan, read this, remember what it is written as, and enjoy the wonders of Hogwarts again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_492?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=492&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I found this to be a fun story, however less believable at times than Rowling's first 7 books. This is probably due to the fact that there is much less detail in a script when compared to the original books. As a play I can see where they can fill in those details with talented acting and set props to make it very entertaining. This book reminds me more of an outline for a full story. I was hoping for more details about their lives over the past 19 years but not much was offered. Instead it really built upon the friendship of albus and scorpius and their complicated relationships with their fathers.  Overall a fun read and just enough of a peak into the current life of Harry Potter to satisfy curiosity. Would definitely recommend to harry potter fans. As for those who haven't read the books yet (maybe you have been hiding under a rock for the last 15 years) they are definitely worth reading before diving into this one because absolutely nothing will make sense to you if you have not read the books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

So, of course I was super stoked for this one. Without giving away any spoilers, I will say that it is a lot darker than I expected to the point that it became a bit of a slog around act 3. Also, keep in mind that it is a play script and not a novel so it does lack some of the richness of description as you would have in the books. I would not recommend this for someone who is not very familiar with the Potter universe simply because without the visuals or more descriptive language they would probably miss some of what is happening. It also reads a bit like fanfic, complete with a Mary Sue. That said, it was still an enjoyable trip down Nostalgia lane. All your favorite characters make appearances (even some you might not expect to see) and is worth adding to your collection if you love Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

This took me back to elementary school when I first began reading the Harry Potter novels. Reading this play even wanted me to go back and re-read the Harry Potter series all over again.

This book picks up from the end; Harry and Ginny are married and Hermione and Ron are married. Both couples have kids and we get to learn of their different personalities. You get to meet Harry's son Albus Severus Potter and see the mess he bets himself into...while being introduced to a new and powerful person.

The plot was cheesy at first but I love the characters and I love the world Rowling created. The plot gets better as the story progresses. The fact that it's written as a screenplay is different and interesting. I would love to see the play. Overall, a solid read that I will probably revisit in the future.

I was quite worried that the book was going to be bad, due to the previous negative reviews I had read stating that it read like fan fiction and not like Rowling, however i was quite please with the outcome. I have to admit at times the characters did seem to act a bit too childish for my taste (compared to harry, ron and hermione's mature look on life.. but then again, they had harder life experiences than their children), but over looking that,  the main story was quite good and if you just really remind yourself that Rowling DID write this,  you can overcome the negative parts and learn to love the story as a whole.

The story hits so many of our vulnerable places; both as a child and as a parent.  Don't discount this story through the first Act.

Harry enters the room
""Harry: Good morning, Ginny""
Ginny looks at Harry
""Ginny: Good morning""

I did more of a mental adjustment: ""Harry walked into the room and said good morning to Ginny. ""Good morning"", said Ginny.

What Harry receives from his parents is passed on to his own son much like we see in many tales of literary adventure like the vampire slayer von Helsing family or Gregory Maguire's character Elphaba. The theme of geerational karma emphasizes Universal Truths of good and evil with which humans must constantly struggle. Many times a certain family is chosen to serve as hero for the masses, like the Potter family in this series. And, of course, we readers may suspect that the Potter family will continue defending humanity in the future whether the stories are written or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

When they announced they were going to release the rehearsal script, I was happy, but didn’t plan to buy it right away.  I should know me better than that.  Yep, I caved and bought Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the week it came out.

If you aren’t yet familiar with the world of Harry Potter thanks to the wildly successful novels and equally wildly successful movies, then this book isn’t for you.  It assumes you know the backstory to what happens here, and if you don’t, you will be positively lost.  There are references to events and cameos by characters from the past books.  However, if you are already a fan, you’ll love diving into the latest story.

What is most notable about this book is that it is a bound copy of the rehearsal script for the play.  That means it reads very differently than a novel.  Essentially, it gives us dialogue and minimal stage direction and even less description.  It’s a different type of read, and you need to be in the proper mindset going into the book as a result.

The play actually opens with a scene we are already familiar with - the epilogue of the final novel.  In it, we see an adult Harry Potter sending his middle child off to his first year at Hogwarts.  From there, we see Albus Severus Potter landing in the unlikeliest house in the school and making a surprising best friend.  We breeze through a few scenes before really landing on the heart of the story, which involves time travel, alternative realities, and a chance to save an innocent from dying.  But when things go wrong, can Albus Potter undo what he has done?  Can Harry Potter work with his son to save the day?

I’ve seen some fans complain about this book being glorified fan fiction, and I can see their complaints.  The plot seems a little wacky overall, not the carefully thought out books in the series.  Yet, every time I started to feel that way, the characters pulled me back into the story and I forgot my complaints.  If you know and love these characters, it’s hard to not cheer for them.  I still feel like the basic premise of the story doesn’t sit completely right, but I don’t mind so much.

And that’s because I love the core cast of characters, and it was great to see them again.  I’m not sure I bought Ron’s personality in the story, but that’s my only real quibble with the characters.  There was a surprise ally along the way, and I loved seeing that relationship develop.  There were some truly touching moments as well.  Many of them were predictable, but that didn’t make them any less touching.

Those used to the immersive world of the Harry Potter novels will definitely miss that here.  Once again, we are reading a play, which is mostly dialogue.  The details of Harry’s world aren’t here because we would see that on stage.

And maybe that’s part of the reason I always had a hard time getting truly into the world like I would the books.  I kept picturing actors on a stage as events unfolded.  And the short scenes always made me think of how the scenes would change for an audience.  I tried to picture how they’d do the magic on stage as well.  That was distracting, although it is a personal issue.

The book is only 300 pages, so shorter than most of the novels.  Couple that with lots of white space because this is a script, and you have a very fast read.  Again, I think this helps explain some of the complaints from fans.

While I don’t think this will ever be anyone’s favorite book in the series, I’m certainly glad I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  If I ever get a chance to see it, I’ll jump.  If you are a fan, go into it expecting a play script instead of a novel, and you’ll be just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Doenges","If you're old Harry Potter reader with a good memory of all the wonderful settings","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2016","If you've never read Harry Potter, then this isn't the place to start.  It depends not only upon the general premise or some characters from the previous series, but also upon some very specific past plot sequences.  Indeed the plot of this book is very clever, hence the four stars.  If you don't already have a sense of setting and characters, you will not find enough here.  If you are Jonesing for the next Harry Potter book, again I'd say stop. This is not the next book; it's the next story.  Big difference.  As this is a play script, there is virtually no setting.  Unlike reading a novel with its rich descriptions of things and moods and circumstances, this is a play written sparingly.  The clever story hangs upon dialog and some simple stage directions.

If you're old Harry Potter reader with a good memory of all the wonderful settings, that you can call to mind as the play unfolds, and if you know the characters well enough to pick up with them much later, then you love this.  The new characters in the form of children are a wonderful addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I purchased this book knowing it was **not written by JK Rowling and that it is an **inspired fanfiction story.

The book picks up right at the epilogue of the last movie/book ends (19 years later at King's Cross station). So far the story is ok but you can tell it's fanfiction, so if you're expecting another Harry Potter masterpiece this may not be the book for you.

Once I got used to the new format, this felt like a seamless continuation of the original series. I enjoyed it very much.

The characters are multidimensional and well-developed. Old friends from the previous books are brought in and out in a natural way, complete with the ""baggage"" of having lived and changed over twenty years, while the new, younger characters carry the plot line.

Since it's the screenplay/play write there is not detail into what certain things would look like, for instance the neighborhoods, or the train, or the outfits.  You lose the guidance for your imagination.  I think the story line was predictable at times and other times you didn't see it coming.  It's obviously shorter than most HP books because of the formatting and lack of detail.  The first 25% was slow, very slow for me.  The next 25% was fast and interesting, the 3rd 25% was again slow and the last 25% was wonderful.  There are limited characters so that makes it a breeze to keep up with everyone involved.  If you're a HP fan, and followed all the previous books, you will enjoy this because you have a baseline for characters and their personalities to carry into your own imagination.

These wonderful details created strong characters and a mesmerizing universe that cannot be fully fleshed out in screenplay form. Also, the story spanned years and felt rushed. I would have loved to see Albus's character developed more, so I could actually comprehend his feelings and actions. Even with my minor qualms, I guess I should feel privileged that we even were given this continuation and an actual published version.

The play starts with the last scen of Deathly Hallows, and through the magic of time travel revisits the events of Goblet of Fire.  Key elements of the story are the relationships between Harry and his son Albus, and Albus and Scorpio Malfoy.  The ongoing theme is how small changes in the past can mean large differences in the present.  As an adult who has read a lot of science fiction, I pretty much figured everything out halfway through the play.

Not really. Anyone who expected that is going to be sadly mistaken. A script is not a novel and does not come across as one. You are not going to be transported to the wizarding world as easily and it is harder to connect with the story and the characters. You need prose or to see it performed for that. But, if you can use your imagination to transport yourself into this world, you won't be disappointed. The characters you love are there along with new ones, the story is very grand and reminiscent of the books. The story is more about relationships between characters as opposed to an overly magical setting and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how relationships between some of my favorite characters have evolved as they grew up more and their relationships with their children.

I've read other reviews that said the story and characters are flat and two dimensional, again I believe that is a problem with the way a script reads versus a novel and I think many people are going to be expecting something different. I've also read that people found inconsistencies between this and the books. I didn't notice anything major, but I also have not read a lot of the extended universe material.

Overall, I really enjoyed the story and format and this is definitely worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

It's also a play of a series that's been done and finished for many years now, movies and everything, even if the world itself hasn't quite died with Rowlings great charity books and new Magical Beasts movies.

Still, this story is good. It fits Harry Potter, and is fun to read. There's just under 300 pages of actual story and because it's written as a play there's little to know description for any of the characters or settings as you're expected to know what they look like already, and the read is extremely fast. There's enough twists and turns to make this a great page turner and I'm happy to add it as the 8th story to my Harry Potter shelf.

If I had any complaints, it's that the story definitely feels written by a guy who doesn't really know the world or characters well enough and whose name I'll never see anywhere but on this book. A lot of the story uses repeated events to get itself going rather than inventing anything new, and sticks with replaying events already written by the master JK Rowling. As a result it is a rehashing story, but it's done well enough that I'll excuse most of it to call it a great play-book. The ending is also completely tied in an extremely tight package that one would expect from any ""they lived happily ever after"" story, rather than the world-changing events that happened at the end of the 7th book. While this isn't a problem for fantasy tales, I still feel it would have been better had something meaningful been added at the end instead of the two heroes looking out over the sunset. Then again, it isn't my story, and my expectations are always going to be greater than what's delivered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_478?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=478&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Then I saw the ratio of 5 stars to 1 star reviews.  I was nervous.  I decided to go into this book understanding that this was not part of the original seven books.  It has Ms. Rowling's name on it but it is not solely her project.  I am glad I took this stance before cracking it open.  I enjoyed it while I was reading and am happy to add it (as a companion piece) to the rest of the collection.  The more I think and talk about the book, though, the more excited I get.  I mean, it's Harry Potter!

I do understand why some have said that there is little to know character development.  Things move quickly - almost whiplash-inducing quickly - but, again, this is a play; a script and (much like a movie) three hours cannot be spent on character evolution.  As an admirer of the original series, I missed ""growing up"" with Albus like we did with Harry but I was also thankful that, as the reader, I was spared the nitty-gritty details and was placed directly into the story.  Besides, it picked up precisely where Deathly Hallows left off.

I laughed more than I expected and there was definitely a few instances where I sighed and placed my hand over my heart at the mention of certain characters.  I would like to see the performance.  Given the stage directions, I think it would be an experience for the senses - as it does not just seem to be visual/audible cues.

I recommend this book to the lovers of the HP series so long as you do not try to fit it in the same pretty and precise little box.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It is somewhat of a continuation of the series, but the feel of it is a bit different. I would have suggested that they take off the Harry Potter in the title of the book and called it something else to stir people away from their expectations. All in all, i really enjoyed it. I was a little hesitant to read it at first because of all the negative reviews, but i felt like the writers did a great job with this story. The set up and the pace is a little bit different from the original books because it's written as a play. However, after reading the book for 5 minutes, i was hooked. I read it in one sitting (it's not a long read). It wasn't a perfect book (it had its up and downs), but i thoroughly enjoyed it and was really entertained. Please note though that is not much of a story about Harry, Ron, etc.. It is a story about their kids. With that being said, it did also did a good job of revisiting old memories I had of Harry and his friends.

I am a huge Harry Potter fan and i think this was a great little spin off to the original story line.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It was an intelligent way to get a peek into Harry's future without  tainting his rich history and instead creatively tying in some of the more memorable moments of his childhood.

Others dislike this because it is in fact a play script and therefore doesn't read with all of the wonderful details and descriptions that a novel would have. However, it does follow the Harry Potter world and it is a wonderful addition. This product is definitely aimed at younger children in concepts and language, more so than the original Harry Potter series which I have read as a child and as an adult. Overall, I would definitely read this again and perhaps to my future children in a few decades to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Like many who have posted reviews here, I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan and have longed to see his story continue.  I have always felt that JK Rowling had much more to tell about the magical wizarding world, and was disappointed that there were no more books after ""Deathly Hallows"".  I think a lot of people were put off by this being a screen play.  It does not allow for the story to be fleshed out or for JK Rowling's lyrical telling of Harry's magical story to be heard as we are accustomed to in previous books.  It would have been an extraordinary book and I will always regret not having the chance to read it as such.  But, in the end, it is still a very good story and a very worthy epilogue to a tale that is so very dear to my heart.  If wishes came true, then this screenplay would be fleshed out to become the 8th book on the series, full of the magical writing that only JK Rowling can deliver.  But, I am happy to have had at least a glimpse back into Harry's world, and will remain hopeful that this is not truly the end of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_118?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=118&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I have tattoos, cats are named after characters, I re-read the series at least 3-4 times a year, and have watched the movies so many times I lost count.  I've been waiting for this SCRIPT for ages.  Major emphasis on script.  I'm not sure why people are bashing it so hard.  Obviously this was written so it could be performed on a stage, it was advertised this way, there was no deception...did people not look into this before reading?  It takes some imagination to make this story really come to life, you have to read it like you're watching people perform it.  The story needs to be fast, a little silly, and come full circle at the end.  THIS IS A PLAY!  It needs to wrapped up quick and keep the audience interested/entertained in the theater and in doing that, yes details were over-looked over and you don't get the full Rowling experience. This is a collaboration and really we're lucky to even have it. Too many people are going into this thinking it's a new novel.  Get that out of your head, or yes, you'll probably be disappointed.

I love seeing old characters.  I love seeing their lives after Voldemort.  I love being back at Hogwarts. I love a new adventure.

I actually enjoyed reading this, it's something new, and it was fun.  It is your typical ""butterfly effect"" story line, but with characters I grew up loving.  I'm happy to read anything J.K. Rowling does with Harry Potter.  I appreciate this SCRIPT and wish I could see it performed live.  My imagination is pretty good, but I'm sure this looks amazing on stage.

Keep an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.  Magic!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I felt that the twist being that Voldemort had a daughter is unrealistic. But, on the other hand, I suppose that when you try to add on another book to a already perfect and well finished series, it's somewhat hard to come up with new foes and a new plot, so I definitely give her lots of credit for that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_431?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=431&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I read a lot of reviews written by folks before I bought it and decided I could enjoy it and I got it. First I downloaded the sample and read it, had a little trouble with it and re read it again.  The second time was better and so I bought it and read that part again....by the time I got to the rest of the book I was reading it with ease and was so caught up in the book that I had a hard time putting it down.  I say it is a must-read book if you are a Harry Potter fan.
I do wish to thank all those who wrote what the book was about!  I don't mind the people who tell what happens next!  That helps me decide if I want to read it.  I would recomend that the disappointed folk who gave a one-star, should try reading it again....it is a screen play....enjoy the different style and be thankful for the chance to find out more of the lives involved in the wonderful world of HP.

The fact that it was a screenplay made it a very nice, easy read.  I was able to finish it very quickly, in a matter of hours.  However, I felt the storyline was quite cheesy in parts and could have used a little more thought in development.

Some characters return, and that is where the magic is its most powerful. As an avid HP fan for over a decade, I can honestly recommend this story to HP fanatics that have always wanted kist that little bit more from the magical world.

I do believe that to see this on stage would change the way most view this script; it's meant to be watched and not read. But it's a great compromise for fans who cannot attend the London show.

Is it perfect? No. Did I smile, and laugh, and feel? Absolutely. And those familiar Potter feelings are all I could have ever wanted from a new HP book. Even if it did feel fanfiction-y.

I'm guessing that those readers have had little exposure to scripts and aren't accustomed to visualizing stage action.  I found the limited stage direction delightful, as it allowed me to imagine the creative use of the set, lights, and stage as I interpret.

Another complaint I've heard is that Harry's actions are out of character. I didn't find that to be the case at all. We are seeing Harry the father for the first time since accompanying young Albus to King's Crossing during the epilogue of The Deathly Hallows. Although a grown man with a child of his own now, Harry is as clumsy with fatherhood as he was with his relationships as a boy... something I believe all parents can relate to at times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Since J.K.Rowling is not here the sole author, there are places where her voice doesn't come through completely, and there are a few disparities with the previous books. This is, after all, a play script. For example, previously the two Weasley twins ran their joke shop. but now their younger brother Ron is shown as the proprietor. Interesting characters from previous books are unmentioned.
  Of course scientific analysis of fantasies is rather pointless - who cares? -  but it occurs to me that all the various creatures described in earlier books could have been created by wizards and witches, and that includes elves, gnomes, trolls, giants, hippogriffs, centaurs... all are derivatives of human beings, designed for either usefulness or just whimsy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child takes readers (and lucky theater patrons) back to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World for one more adventure with beloved characters and new friends and enemies. The script splits its time between the adults and their children, mainly Harry and his younger son Albus, whose relationship is strained under the weight of their family's legacy. Things don't get much easier for Albus when he's sorted in Slytherin and befriends Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's still-nemesis Draco Malfoy. But after eavesdropping on a conversation between Harry and an elderly man still grieving over his son, Albus resolves to steal a Time Turner and fix one of his father's biggest mistakes - a decision with potentially dire consequences.

As excited as I was about Cursed Child, I had my reservations since Rowling didn't create the story alone. But I quickly found myself settling in for the ride and enjoying myself, even laughing out loud at the comedic bits. Most of the returning characters were portrayed accurately (or, matching my impressions of older yet recognizable versions of themselves), and I remembered why I loved (or hated) them all over again. The new characters were also wonderful, especially Scorpius. Yes, a Malfoy was my favorite character this time! But he's kind, nerdy, a voice of reason for Albus, and a hopeless romantic for Ron and Hermoine's daughter Rose. Reading a script was an interesting experience, too. The bare-bones stage directions allowed me to imagine or recall each setting and spell however I chose, and I appreciated that.

I have a BIG problem, though, with Delphi Diggory. It's not her character per se, but her true ""parentage""... It defies logic, from who her parents are (really?!) to the timeline of her birth (and the implications her mother's pregnancy would have had on past HP events). Some fans have also criticized the ""queer-baiting"" in Albus and Scorpius's friendship. I can see where they're coming from... but it reminds me of a similar debate over Frodo and Sam after the Lord of the Rings film trilogy was released, and I didn't agree with that opinion. All I'll say here is that it made sense to me for Albus and Scorpius, two young and awkward boys who are shunned by their peers, to become as close as they did.

Anyways - yes, I'm happy with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It's not my favorite HP story by far, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Now I'll be jealous of anyone who's fortunate enough to see the play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Clark","Not the Novels, but Still Fun for HP Fans","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","4/4.5 stars.

I had very mixed feelings about how to review this.  I'm a huge HP fan, and so reading this was of course super-exciting for me, and I did really enjoy it.  At the same time, it was clear to me that reading a play script is not the same as reading one of the novels.  I've heard great things about the play and by reading the script it sounded amazing; however, the script in and of itself, while interesting, was a less fabulous experience than reading the books.

Of particular interest to me as a writer was the fact that the script, by leaving out (as scripts do) all the ""slow"" stuff that fills up novels, was a less rewarding reading experience.  Scripts by their nature can't have any internal monologue or reflection: everything has to be said out loud, or portrayed by the actors' physical movements on stage/screen.  Scripts also have very minimal descriptions of settings and background, and the action is by necessity compressed.  The result is something very spare--I finished the entire thing in a couple of hours--that is more like a sketch than a book.  It's a book in which the author has taken the common command these days to ""tighten up your writing"" and ""cut filler"" to its maximum possible expression, and the result is something that is not really a book.  All the empty space on the page between is just...empty space on the page, lacking the depth that the novelistic form provides.  Which is not to say that this is bad, per se, it just highlighted for me the unique benefits of the novel, which allows for a depth and introspection that other forms do not.

All that being said, Harry Potter fans like me are probably going to enjoy this.  Aside from the genre differences, reading it was more like a cruise through a greatest hits album with the occasional original track thrown in than a fully-fledged new book, but a lot of the old magic is still there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Johns","This is good as long you are clear what you're getting","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2016","There seems to be some confusion from certain buyers of this ""book"" about what they are getting and comparing it to the original seven works of the Harry Potter heptalogy. This is a bound script book. It's literally the script to a stage play of a new story set in the HP universe. As such, it is almost all dialogue with very little of the detailed exposition that so many of us loved in the original series.

Keeping in mind that this is merely a script, I give the work 4 stars. Would I have loved to have seen it fleshed out into a proper eighth book - of course I would have. So would almost everyone who has read it, but it is what it is and as an HP fan I'm glad that the story has continued with the main three characters set 22 years in the future.

Without giving away too many spoilers, the story mostly revolves around the sons of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy and their daddy issues that get them into lots of trouble. Of the two, I found that Draco's son, Scorpius, was easily the most entertaining and distinct character but Albus Potter was also well defined.

As far as the adults, Hermione is very Hermione-like and Ron is exactly what you'd expect a middle-aged Ron to be like. The one character that just didn't ring very authentic to me was adult Harry. There was just something off about his depiction and his relationship with his son Albus that didn't ring true to me.

It's a quick read being that it's a 300 page script book so be prepared for that. And maybe I had lower expectations knowing that this wasn't a ""real"" book, but I still think it's a very welcome addition to any Potter fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

My love for ALL things Harry Potter runs deep.  This is in my opinion HANDS DOWN the GREATEST series ever written.  The thought of being able to dive back into this world made me so, so happy.  I have had the book for a while and have been dying to get to it, but other things got in the way.  Now that I am done, I just want to open it up and read it again.

I cannot even count anymore how many times I have listened to The Harry Potter Series, or read it, or watched the movies.  It is too many to count.  Every time I get like a giddy little school girl again, because they make me that excited and happy.

Anyhow, lets get on to the review.

This is a script of the play that is now playing in England where I wish I was right now watching it.  We get to go on a ride with Harry's son Albus, and Malfoy's son Scorpius.

Albus is a lot like Harry, he likes to ""fix"" things which usually means he is getting into trouble.  Scorpius, is nothing like his father.  He is kind and he befriends Albus right off.

These two remind me so much of Harry and Ron.  Albus and Harry do not get a long very well, and when he befriended Scorpius Harry forbade him to see him anymore.  As a parent of a teenagers I know that is the WRONG thing to say...hehe

Needless to say, Albus and Scorpius set off on an adventure to change the world so that Albus can make his dad proud.

This is such a wonderful read.  I cannot express that enough.  I weeped like a new born baby while reading this book.  I laughed, got mad, and a whole other plethora of emotions.  Rowling's writing goes beyond brilliant.  She makes a world come to life in ways I have never experienced with another book.  She has made these characters personal to me, and I love that more than anything.

If you haven't picked this book up, you should.  Especially if you are a Harry Potter fan.  I know there are so many nay sayers out there about this book, but in my opinion they don't know what they are talking about..hehe

I hope there are more to come.  I hope they make this into a movie or bring the play to America.  I need more Harry Potter in my life.  It just makes me happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

So did Draco Malfoy. Now we follow Albus Severus Potter and Scorpio Malfoy in an epic time travel adventure that sees them going back in time to try to change the future. What they don't think about is how their actions in the past will change the future.

If you're in need of a Harry Potter fix, then you will enjoy this. Yes. This is a play. But its better than nothing. You'll see what your old favorites are up to and learn more about the post-Voldemort world. No, it's not like the other books. Which is fine enough too. Just read it and make up your mind about it.

Also, as someone who got placed in the Slytherin house, I was happy to see certain events take place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I enjoyed this glimpse into what would be a more modern-day wizarding world. Albus and Harry's strained relationship is intriguing, and the I love the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. I was, however, more than a little disappointed itn the offhand way the female characters were dealt with--very un-Rowling-like, in my humble opinion. I know she co-authored this, but it appears to me that she let the male authors deal a bit too much with Hermoine and Ginny. I'd have liked to see the stong women they should have become.

A great read usually stops me from watching ""any movie"" because my imagination is typically greater than any portrayal. Because this book is written for a 'play' it falls short for creating images.

I'm also a huge Harry Potter fan, having read the entire series around 8 times, so I was very excited for this. This is a good read in general, but definitely doesn't stack up to the original series. The style is very different and the plot feels thrown together and not as meticulously planned out as the original series. The plot is reminiscent of fan fiction about the characters as opposed to a published work, and is at times outrageous. I felt that parts seemed out of character or not compliant with statements J. K. Rowling has made about this timeline. This being said, this book was enjoyable to read. I found moments poignant and humorous. I enjoyed Scorpius' character a lot.

Well, I was a little disappointed. It read like more of a fan-fiction novel than the original Harry Potter books, and I found it to be a little over the top in regards to its occasional cheesiness. Sometimes the dialogue of the characters didn't seem to fit the personality of the characters from the previous novels. In my opinion, the whole thing seemed a little bit rushed and forced.

However, because I'm still a huge Harry Potter fan, I still had to give it 4 stars due to my pure excitement about there even BEING an eighth book.

Harry and Ginny are married with three children: James, Albus, and Lily. Ron and Hermione are married with two children of their own. This account revolves around Albus, the misfit of the family. He is so afraid he will be sorted into Slytherin and in his first year his worst fears are confirmed. These seem to be Harry's worst fears too. An unexpected friendship with Scorpius Malfoy makes the relationship between Harry and Albus drift even further apart. After overhearing Amos beg Harry for what he believes to be the last remaining time turner in existence, Albus gets it in his head that by saving Cedric Diggory he can right all his father's wrongs.

I really liked this installment in the Harry Potter saga. The screenplay format made it a quick and easy read. There was a lot of emotion and feeling. The middle part of the story was phenomenal. Without giving too much away, I loved seeing the alternate versions of the wizarding world. The reappearance of so many beloved characters was a real treat.

The one thing I didn't like is that I felt like some of the characters weren't true to their nature's from the previous books in the series. Snape and Draco in particular. Though I did enjoy the direction they went with Draco and hearing his entire story made me understand more. Also, McGonagall was much more lax as headmistress when as a teacher she was extremely strict and a stickler for rules.

I would give this one a4 out of 5. I liked it. It had some really great parts while others fell flat. The resolution to the main plot was good but I thought the resolution to character relationships I thought was lacking. I would've liked to see a bit more development there. It is definitely worth reading for fans of the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I was excited about Cursed Child and had high expectations that were not met. Overall the story is good- I thought it was going in one direction and they threw a curveball in which was refreshing. It was also fast paced and a quick read. However, I felt as though some of the character choices didn't make sense and the book was still reliant on Harry.
Logistically, I am fascinated to know how they pull this off on stage as the scene is constantly changing. Some people may not appreciate the script (vs a novel) but I have a theatre background and liked reading it with each characters voice.

My husband and I are die-hard Potter fans!  The early reviews scared me away, since the reviews spoke about ruining the series for the reader.  I finally decided to take the risk.  I completely disagree with the negative reviews.  Since it was a play and not a novel, it was not as ""meaty"" or ""rich"" in descriptions as her novels.  I thought it was a good story, interesting characters, and old friends, and JK Rowling themes.  I had a problem with how Ron was portrayed ...sort of a ridiculous...and not as bright as the Ron we know in in the first 7 books. I highly recommend Potter fans try this play with an open mind.

I love the plot of the story, I love the characters, and I love the author. But this book is a little bit different...

If you didn't know, this book is a script book. So the writing is a bit different and a bit hard to follow. So if you are a Harry Potter fan, I will tell you this is NOT like the other books. It is a play in London.

Also, most people are upset about what house Albus is in. I know, it's different, but this book is supposed to show that Albus dose NOT want to be like his father.

But here's one thing that kind of upset me. I wish that the author was only J.K. Rowling. I think that the book might have been different if it was only her. But the other authors were still wonderful.

And lastly, the book lacked adventure. Which was also upsetting. But it was supposed to have a lot of heart and it definitely did.

So read this book. It will make you laugh, cry, and stay awake all night.

I wish I could read a new Harry Potter book every month.  JK Rowlings is the absolute best writer and storyteller.  I was engaged right from the beginning.  I could have cried I was so happy to be back in Harry Potter's world.  This book makes you forget about everything and makes you feel like you have stepped into another world.  It was so nice to catch up with all of the beloved characters from the first book and see what is happening with all of them.  I wish Mrs. Rowlings would consider writing more books about Harry Potter.  He is like part of my family and I love reading about his life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_244?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=244&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It is very different reading script versus a novel. You won't get the imagery a novel provides and scripts aren't meant to have that-- I think the folks that were disappointed in reading this were expecting a new novel filled with J.K.

A good way to stay connected to the HP world and follow the stories of our childhood heroes. The play format is easy to read but the lack of description and narrative text makes even the most exciting passes a little flat. Worth it if you're a fan. Not a good way to get into Harry Potter if you haven't read the originals, start from the beginning as this one will spoil several storylines.

K","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2016","I love J.K. Rowling's writing. I have the entire series of Harry Potter. This book is a bit different. It is written more as a play write and if you aren't familiar with play's the descriptions and themes are lain differently than in a typical book. However, this is an action packed book and takes you on a very interesting and unsuspecting journey. The story twists between Harry and his son Albus, and the definition of their relationship is interesting and not quite what you would expect. However, the fact that he hates that his father is famous and has a very well-known past is interesting to say the least. If you love Harry Potter books and you think you would like to try this one. The only thing I would say is be prepared for the play write style of writing in this book. Totally safe reading for kids and young adults. Shoot ! I recommend this book to people of all ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_249?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=249&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

(Spoiler alert)
1) Where Harry and company watched baby Harry's parents get killed by Voldemort, you see Hagrid cine and take Harry. Where is Severus Snape? In the books and movie we know he found and rocked Lily's body while Harry watched.
2) Found it a bit difficult to believe that Bellatrix had Delphi at Malfoy manor without Draco knowing his aunt was pregnant. Also found ity hard to believe that Narcissa would allow Delphi to be raised by someone other than a Malfoy. Just my opinion, however I did enjoy the twist.
If you read this play, try not to make it into a spin of the original Harry Potter books.  This is a much older (40ish) man who isn't perfect, has his flaws, struggles to be a parent, etc. People change and we are fallible. Read it for what it is (barring the two major timeline issues noted above), and enjoy something new.
Honestly, this is an enjoyable read if you can separate the two Harrys. I enjoyed his adult flaws, it made the story more believable. I think the young Harry attitude would have been harder to fathom at this age as whimsical and accidentally getting caught up in things would have made him seen a even worse parent and made it hard to see his marriage to Ginny as believable and real.
I'll make a final note, that maybe will help readers decide, a comparison. In the 10th anniversary edition of ""Twilight"", Stephanie Meyers made a leap with changing almost all of the characters into reversal roles. Many people supremely disliked this and couldn't handle the story because it wasn't of the original Twilight ilk. If you were one of those folks, who couldn't deal with such major change, then I believe you may not enjoy this screenplay.
Hope this helps. Honestly, how can reading another HP reality hurt, in my opinion, but I pretty much love the HP world, so it's easy to be open minded and ready for something different. A bit if a challenge, yes, but worthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I love the series and have read them many times. I find that I always get something different from them every time I read them. I found the same to be true for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The story line is believable and actually use portions from the previous books so they tie in nicely together.
The book is basically a play. It contains stage directions and the dialogue is written as each cast member's parts. This made it a little awkward to read it out loud as we read it together as a family.
All the main characters are accounted for and it was nice to see what came of them as they grew up. I feel as though I just caught up with some old friends that I haven't seen in a while.

So first off no it does not seem like the writing of jk all that much however I did enjoy the book a lot which is why I gave it 4/5 people were saying it didn't seem like a harry potter book but I highly disagree I really think it does. Only thing I really didn't like about this book was that it sped through parts of his child's life that I would have like to read a little more into. Because in the harry potter books he was in year one in book one and so on and so forth I knew it wouldn't be drawn out that much but I did think that It would give you a little more information.

I enjoyed the story line, the cast of characters and the action. The limitation of the script format didn't detract my pleasure of the story.  I thought the characters were very well written.  In particular I enjoyed the portrayal of Scorpius Malfoy, who was very likeable, and I found Albus Potter rather irritating, not because of poor character development but because he was written that way.

I went into it with an open mind and realized that the play itself was based on a story and not directly written by J.K. Rowling. I felt that it was quite fast moving and I did miss the rich full detail of the original series, but I understand clearly that this is a play, just the dialogue that misses the richness that is filled in by the visuals of watching a play in person. Additionally this wasn't a complex novel, it is the script of a play so the long meandering conversations and slowly developing story that I love about the original books was definitely missing. Again, I don't count this against the play because that is just not what a play is.

I found myself filling in a lot of the missing bits with my own visuals in my head. After having read the books so very many times, J.K. Rowling's original descriptions left me a wonderful imaginative landscape to watch this story play out in. I think as a free standing play without the knowledge and history of Hogwarts, the wizarding world and the characters themselves, this probably comes up short. As a piece of the Harry Potter universe, it was a fun jaunt through nostalgia and I actually found the plot to be unexpected and entertaining.

I read the play for entertainment and I definitely got what I was looking for. If you're looking for a significant addition to the Harry Potter novels akin to another book, you will be disappointed. If you're looking to read the script to a play that tells an interesting story about the goings on of several familiar characters and how life has changed since the original books, then this is a fun read with surprises, laughs, and lots of nostalgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Shanahan","Canon...adjacent? (Spoilers for the plot)","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2017","I was 17 when Deathly Hallows came out so I grew up with Harry Potter like a lot of these reviewers.  I own all the audiobooks and listen to them frequently.  I was so excited to hear a play would be brought to life and even more so that those of us without a hope of seeing it live in London would still get a chance to read the new story through the published rehearsal script.

I continue to have mixed feelings about the story as a whole.  There are parts I adore about this story, such as Scorpius being the greatest child ever, Draco admitting to his lonliness and vowing to bring his son up differently than how he was raised, the struggle Albus feels carrying the weight of his father's legacy and pressure to succeed.  And then there are parts that I struggle to reconcile with what I know and love about the HP series.  I cannot fathom the idea of Voldemort having a child - consensual or not, magical intervention or not - with anyone.  I can't imagine any amount of public humiliation at the Triwizard Tournament that would turn Cedric into a Death Eater and kill Neville at the Battle of Hogwarts.  I can't imagine Harry ever saying he sometimes wishes Albus weren't his son.  Even if he regrets it immediately, I'm not sure I could see him going that far even in the heat of the moment.

I had issues with the mechanics and plot holes that time-turning caused in Prisoner of Azkaban and had many of the same issues with the time-turning in this story as well.  I felt quite a bit like the entire hidden purpose of having a story involving time travel was just a way to bring back old characters for the fans to see again, although I don't feel any characters were done any real justice by that so it was often awkward.  Most of the characters felt at least a bit *off* to me; close to their canon personalities but not quite right.  I started referring to it as 'canon-adjacent'; it's easy to say it's a fan-made telling of Harry's future if that's easier to accept, but for a lot of people it's also a perfectly acceptable addition to the series.  Accept the parts you like, and continue to daydream and rework the parts you don't.  Fiction allows that kind of freedom for headcanon.

I would love the opportunity to see it performed live.  While this wouldn't change the issues I had with the plot, it would definitely be a more well-rounded experience with the story overall and I think I'd have a better appreciation for the story presented in a completely new medium for the HP canon.  I think I could forgive some of the more absurd points if I had a more complete picture of the experience, with the atmosphere and magic - both literal and figurative - I associate with the series as a whole.  I'm definitely saving my pennies for when it makes the trip to Broadway!

Overall, I flew through the book and enjoyed the experience of dipping my toes back into the world of Harry Potter after so many years of having no new material, but it's clear this was a fan work and not the complete brainchild of Jo Rowling.  Her approval and backing of it tells me that she's at least behind this tell of the future of her characters even if she didn't write it, which is a bit tough to think about given how different parts of it feel.  However, I don't think it's fair for me to do what so many fans have done by completely trashing it and writing it off.  I think it's given the fandom overall a new thing to discuss and debate and love (as many people do!) and that's important.

Lodge","Totally worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","Things you must understand:

One, this is a script for a play, not really a book. It reads like a play, the details offered are those you'd get in a play (stage directions and so on). It's easy to read but this is a different kind of Harry Potter book. Two, you won't have to worry about what they left out when they make the movie as you know they will. There isn't much that they could leave out. Three, if you were worried that this was going to ruin the series for you - don't. It holds up the Potter flag. You won't be disappointed.

In some ways, this reads like fan fiction. What happened if... and they got Rowling involved to make it all work. And it does work. You will enjoy the story, you will believe these are the same characters, and in the end you will care about what happens to them. I can't give it 5 stars mostly because I wanted an 8th book, and this isn't that, it's a lot less detail and a lot less story. But it was a whole lot of fun. If you keep in mind that this is NOT an 8th book but the script for a play, you will enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Rowling’s play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, billed as the eighth Potter story, was released on July 31st.  Naturally, I and the world and his dog rushed to pick up a copy.  Here are my thoughts.  I should point out that I have not seen the play, worse luck, and am going from the script alone.  Note that there will be total and complete spoilers, which I will hide after the cut.

First, the non spoilery section. There was a lot I loved about it, and some things that didn’t work nearly so well for me.  I loved that the same themes that pervaded the book series – love, friendship, family, loyalty – still form the core of Cursed Child.  It was wonderful seeing how Harry, Ron and Hermione coped with adult life and parenthood (being an adult myself, it was especially fascinating.). The new characters, Scorpius and Albus and their friendship are completely adorable – Scorpius really does get all the best lines.  And, naturally, it is simply wonderful to revisit the Wizarding World in any shape or form.  Rowling’s world is utterly breathtaking.  I really wish I could see how certain scenes played out on stage.

What I didn’t enjoy so much were certain plot points.  I didn’t feel they gelled too well with what we know about the Wizarding World and the characters in it.  Some character development points I didn’t feel worked too well in a play setting.  They might have worked better for me in novel format with more space to expand and develop them.  Also, while it’s not necessary to have devoured Pottermore, certain interactions do have much more meaning if you are aware of some of the character’s backstories.

All in all I enjoyed Cursed Child and gave it four stars out of five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

I imagine JK and whoever had some great ideas to a fanfiction, and then turned it into a play. It resembles a fanficiton A LOT. I mean, I read A LOT of fanfiction, and this is some of the stuff I've been looking at, so seeing it as an official book was pretty crazy!

But in my opinion, it doesn't come anywhere close to seeing it live. There's so much magic & theatricality on stage, and simply reading the dialogue with limited stage directions doesn't make any of that come to life.

I did however, brace myself prior to reading this book. I was aware that J.K. Rowling was most likely only minimally involved and that it wasn't going to read the same since it was a screen play. I think that knowledge and preparation made it easier for me to enjoy this book. The biggest issue with it? That was probably the fact that it tried to do so much with so little. Plays have to be short enough to sit through, yet this one spanned great amounts of time and jumped around. It therefore lacked the detail necessary at times to make plot twists believable. I found myself sitting there wondering 'how?' and 'why' way too many times. I think that was the hardest part for most Potter fans and why so many say it reads like a fanfic. It simply doesn't take the time to develop and explain things and simply relies on people taking everything in stride. That being said, I felt there were some truly 'Harry Potter' moments. I got a little teary eyed and nostalgic at times, and that is really why I enjoyed it. I would not recommend comparing this to the books. There is no contest. It has no where near the talent in it that they did. That being said, it certainly has a place in the Harry Potter world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_118?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=118&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

But this is not really new ground, and that is ok because Ms Rowling has already outdone herself. She has no obligation to wow me anymore. The characters have aged appropriately and have the appropriate amount of angst. The next generation of characters were presented well, but it is difficult to feel the same emotion toward them. Don't read this if you haven't been a fan. If you are a fan, be prepared for the script formula instead of the usual narrative and scene descriptions.

Both father and son are having difficulties accepting each other and where they fit into the wizarding world.

This book is written as a script for a play, and sometimes feels very much like Harry Potter meets a Comedy of Errors - but, not in a bad way.

It has a powerful plot line while spotlighting difficulties between fathers and sons, which is weird, given that we have known these fathers since they were 11 years old.

I'm about to dig in for my 2nd read and am only sorry that it isn't/wasn't fleshed out into a novel.

His unlikely friendship with Scorpious proved that old animosities can be set aside and friendships see beyond the exterior into the core of who the person is. Now I have a great desire to travel to London to see it performed, or hold my breath for them to make it into a movie (or two), bringing back our old cast favorites :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I enjoyed this book as well as I enjoyed the previous seven, I think it is very wise and deep and really touching. I advise all grown up readers to read it as soon as possible - it is real magic.

Based on the reviews, I wasn't sure if buying the book was a great idea, but I enjoyed it. A few words of advice for fellow readers:

-The play format sucks. There's no getting around it. There's notes in italics on what the characters are doing, what scenery is changing, etc. Not ideal, but still readable.

-It gets a little corny. Go into it with a sense of humor, and also remembering that Harry was a bit bitter by the end of the 7th book. Relieved, yes, but still somewhat bitter.

*****SPOILER ALERT *******
-His son is in Slytherin. Happens in the first, oh, 15 pages, but that adds to the divide in the rest of the book and all of the teenage thinking that follows.

I honestly think it would be fantastic if not for the play format. But if you remember how all of the characters were and how they acted in the previous books, it's really not hard for your imagination to fill in the blanks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_487?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=487&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It was AWESOME!! I recommend it 10/10, my favorite book in the series! It really showed Harry's trauma from the war, which I loved. It's rare when authors explore psychological elements like that, and even rarer when it's done so well. It was shorter than the other books, and I read it in under six hours, while the others took me three days to two weeks. It's as action-packed and emotionally deep as all of the others, with a bonus of being even more relatable than the rest of them.

As a screenplay,  it is mostly dialogue. It is not the richly written book that the rest of the series is. Much of the richness comes from actually seeing the play (which I have seen in London). It is based on the series but is not written by  J K Rowling.

After a brief time, I got used to the format and enjoyed the story. But without all the descriptive portions, I found it to  be easily forgettable.

Definitely a lot more fun to read than King Lear! I would have preferred a novel. The storyline was good and ticked along at a rapid pace. There was a large cast of characters but it never became overwhelming. Personally I would have preferred more character development and in particular the adult Harry, Draco and Hermione could have been fleshed out a bit more. Instead they were more or less the same as their teenage selves and it was hard to find them credible. The next generation characters were also heavily reliant on the previous Harry Potter books for their development and motivation. A fun read for Potter fans but could do with an accompanying novel to fill in the gaps","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Kenyon","While I'm sorry it's not a novel, it's still well worth the read!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","My sister asked me what I thought about this book, and I told her it had me spellbound. It pulled me in so quickly that I read it in one sitting. While it doesn't equate to the in-depth delight of reading the previous 7 books, anyone who likes Harry Potter should read this book.

It's hindered, of course, by it's format. It's a script, and so much of the magic of the novels is missing. Being limited to dialogue and stage direction means that this story, while enchanting, lacks the full bodied delight of the novels. The setting descriptions are very sparse, we don't truly ""see"" the characters, and without being able to watch the actors on stage, we miss the nuances that would be given to us through introspection and narration.

However, I truly loved this glimpse into the future of our beloved Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron. Seeing them navigate adult responsibilities and parenthood is a lot of fun. And the glimpses of other beloved characters (McGonagall, Draco, etc.) was like finding out that while yes, you did indeed already eat the whole cake, there was still a bit of frosting left over to enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

A lot of the reviews on here are pretty telling of that.  I think a lot of fans were expecting typical Harry, Hermoine, and Ron high jinx which you just don't get from this story.  It lacks JK Rowling's magical touch, but that is because she didn't write it.  She came up with a story with these 2 men, and in turn these 2 men turned it into a play.  Play scripts aren't the easiest to read sometimes.  They tend to lack dimension and can have characters coming off a little flat.  For this particular story some of the flatness does come from the writing.  There are moments that could have definitely been better, but I also think some of the lack luster moments are nothing like that while you sit and watch the actors weave their magic into the characters they are portraying.
After all the negative reviews I read I was a little hesitant to start even reading, but half way through I realized it wasn't as awful as some of the more melodramatic reviews are portraying it to be.  Is it the same Harry that we've all grown up with no; but that's just it who is the exact same as they were 19 years ago?  Harry is almost 40 overworked and living a rather mundane life compared to his adolescent years.  The play deals with far more dare I say muggle issues and much less of the wizarding world magic we've all been use to.
This story won't work for everyone who is a lover of this series and I can see why.  For me this story has in no way changed how I feel about the series, as other have felt it has ruined it for them.  If you are on the fence I'd say read it. Definitely go in with an open mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The storyline holds to Rowling's twisty standards, but the format does not allow for her rich descriptions, which are so much of her writing charm. The tale is solid, but it is a quick read, which for many HP fans will not be enough. I loved reading the tale in script format, as my imagination could fill in the blanks, but I long for more Harry and friends and am sad that I have already finished it. I can imagine that the play is quite entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

So much so she willingly stopped protecting her husband from me. A little backstory... I was friends with her husband first and throughout the years of knowing him he has sold me inch by inch more pieces of his sphincter and color starting from his anus. These were transactions that usually included me feeding him delicious home cooked meals or treating him to a ""Man Date."" I am a Straight Man but we've played this game where we try to catch each other off guard and do things like cop a feel, grab butt, or even do Kancho (see definition below).  After he met his wife she's tried to be his shield. Why I am telling this story?  After gifting his wife this as a Christmas Present she said to him that she cannot protect him any more because I gave her the Best Present Ever.

Long story short: This can make wives stop protecting their husbands from being molested or violated.

*Kancho is a game or trick often played in Japan by young school-aged children; it is performed by clasping the hands together so the index fingers are pointing out and attempting to insert them into someone's anal region when the victim is not looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_164?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=164&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Good story!","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2016","First off this is written as a play with the majority of the writing coming from Jack Thorne not J.K. Rowling; however, the writing style is very in sync with her other books.  This jumps around a lot more than a traditional novel with much shorter chapters if you will, because it is designed to be acted out on a stage in front of a live audience.  Coming in at just over 300 pages it was a quick and easy read.  The story line is actually not bad at all, though some seem to be throwing fits about it.  It takes a little getting used to reading this as a play, but it didn't bother me much at all.

I recommend giving this book a try.  It's actually well written with a viable story line and interesting plot twists.

Rowling and the creative team behind Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and it almost struck me as meta-commentary that the story ends up being about Albus struggling in Harry’s shadow. This is a play that’s immensely aware of the shoulders it is standing on, and that tries for better or worse to embrace its difficult position.

Personally, I felt it succeeded quite well under the circumstances. While there were certainly some missteps here (it’s very show-not-tell; several of the central conceits seemed to me to contradict our previously existing canon or just struck me as implausible for this world; there are some very awkward implications about Hermione’s fate without Ron; Ron himself seems a little too broadly comic; I would have loved more trio time and at least a cameo from Neville and Luna), I greatly enjoyed being able to immerse myself in this world again. I really appreciated the choice to spend time revisiting well-traveled story territory and giving it new life and new detail, especially given that the story is in many ways more about the next generation as it was about the original heroes I came to see.

I also thought Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, in addition to exploring the reliable series themes of the vulnerabilities and blindness created by and yet the ultimate power of love, hit on something very real and very natural in focusing on sons struggling with the legacies of their dads and dads struggling with their own pasts in trying to raise their sons. We know how difficult it can be in this world to grow up the child of a famous or infamous father, and it seems like it would be exponentially worse in the world of Wizarding Britain, which is so obsessed with family and bloodlines.

I don’t think I would ever recommend someone start with Cursed Child (and if you’re reading this and haven’t read the series for some reason, fair warning: this is very much written for people who know and love Harry Potter, and please borrow my copy of Sorcerer’s Stone at your leisure), but I think it’s a worthy addition to the series, I’m extremely jealous of anyone who gets to see it play out on stage, and if this exemplifies what J.K. Rowling’s version of Harry’s future is I would love to read more of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_434?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=434&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I felt almost scared about reading this play, since I did not want it to take away from the magic of the world the 7 books (and movies) had created.

When finally getting to read the play, I was very positively surprised. I enjoyed that the storyline focuses on just a few characters, as we know it from the other books where Harry, Ron and Hermione used to be the main characters. To me it seemed better this way, instead of trying to give uptdates about each and every characters live (I do realise some characters like Hugo or George are completely left out of the storyline or only touched upon quickly - however, it used to be the same in the books, with for example Hermiones parents only appearing very little. Now other characters are in the main focus, and some we used to ""know"" better in the books aren't as much talked upon. I don't see this as something negative).

The play seems like an actual new story, while at the same time tying in nicely many questions left open within the 7 books. I had to read it a second time directly after having read it for the first time, and was left with a very content feeling. It seems to confirm things that had happened throughout the books taking away any possible doubts about why something had to happen the way it did happen in the book series.

I can only recommend ready this play, but do keep in mind it is a play - you need to imagine more for yourself - but again, I don't see that as a problem.

I cannot wait to get to see the actual play!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Revisiting familiar places, people and events the Cursed Child is a nice catching up with old friend and also some perceived enemies. Harry, now grown with three kids of his own sends his second son Albus off to Hogwarts. Who he meets there, the friends he makes and the things he gets up to well… you’ll have to read the book if you want to know because I will not give away anything here.

Written as an Official Script book for the play, this definitely reads slightly differently than the previous installments. After taking a few pages/scenes to familiarize myself with the formatting I think I actually preferred this format for the purpose of this story, it worked very nicely. The scenes are sketched in basic format and it is left to the reader to fill in the blanks… as grand or minimal as you like. Clocking in an a little over 300 pages, I’m fairly certain that if this were a traditional novel we would have been looking at closer to 500 pages.

 After reading “Cursed Child”, I find myself nostalgic for the Wizarding World and would love to see more installments of the grown up Hogwarts alum and the new generation of wizards. As far as if that will become a reality, I guess only Professor Treylawney knows for sure; but  I would definitely be game for seeing the stage production if it ever makes it stateside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_457?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=457&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I was pleasantly surprised. Your three teenagers (how we left them) grew up & were living adult lives with problems. Albus Severus was a middle child & Scorpio was an only child. Both weren't popular & they were drawn together. I don't want to say a lot because of spoilers but trust was misplaced & they were curious. Wanting to do something good for another person but being boys, you can hurt or get hurt not knowing what you are doing. Albus was the middle child, he would never be anything special to his parents & he could never live up to his Dad's legacy. He reminded me of Harry when Draco told him there were people to hang out with and ones to stay away from. He stood up to Draco & made clear Ron was good enough for him. Albus did the same on the train to Hogwarts. He joined Scorpio in an empty train compartment (Scorpio was alone). Albus' cousin Rose told him they needed to sit elsewhere, basically Scorpio was not a person to sit by and especially be friends with. Albus stood up for Scorpio. After that, Rose, his own cousin severed all ties with Albus. When Harry was young, he idolized his dead father. Albus resented his living father and wished he wasn't his son. I could go on but read this book through the eyes of Albus & Scorpio & what transpired. When parents don't keep open dialogues with their children & tell them how they should feel instead of listening to them, bad things can and will happen in our real world and even in Harry Potter's world. Read it from this point of view and you may really enjoy this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Rowling.  I have been a huge Harry Potter fan since 5th grade, and was really excited about HP and the Cursed Child.  This is probably going to sound silly, but I decided before reading it that i was going to treat it as something separate from the original seven books - almost as though all of the characters were brand new characters who just happened to have the same names as the original Harry Potter characters.  This helped me to enjoy the book a lot more, because I could just enjoy it for the quick action, rather than comparing it to how I envisioned the future of Harry and his peers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Cooper","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - whens the movie going to be produced?","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2016","This is a play script, not a book. But still it reads like it fits right in with the other Harry Potter novels. Basically, the story starts off right where the postscript of the movie Death Hallow part 2 left off, with Harry, Ginny and sons at Platform 9 3/4 as Albus Severus Potter prepares to leave for his first year at Hogwarts and is worrying about being sorted into Slytherin.

I will try to avoid spoilers, but let's just say Albus makes best friends with Scorpius Malfoy, who seems to have fallen far from his father's and grandfather's tree.

There's a timeturner involved, a prophecy, and the return of Voldemort.

That should be enough to get you hooked.  For me, I am waiting for the play to come to the USA and then I have to figure out how to secure some of the tickets which will may be sold out for decades in advance.

And if you figure it out, tell me who the cursed child is supposed to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Harry Potter has a huge following and many people from my generation (myself included) grew up with Harry. These books are hands down the reason I learned to love reading. There’s also a few things you should know about this installment, if you don’t already: its written as a script and while the story is from J.K. Rowling, it still had to be translated to a play form so we don’t get a lot of the descriptions and detail we are used to in the books. There were absolutely phrases I recognized and I was so appreciative of that. I’m not saying this is necessarily a disappointment, and I know it was necessary to adapt the story to a script. Still, I missed it.

That being said, did I enjoy the story? Yes, I did. I honestly did not have any expectations, because how could you when the story is told in such a different format? In a way, I think Rowling is smart to do it this way. If she had simply written another book, would I have been disappointed if it didn’t live up to the first seven? Probably. Most likely. But with a play..its new and original. Its a standalone, in a way, and I can appreciate it for what it is.

As for the story line, there were many aspects that were really heartwarming. There were elements from past books, and scenes with characters I never imagined I would see again. There are relationships I was happy to watch develop. I don’t want to say too much about the plot though. The story mainly follows Albus Severus Potter and his adventure. There’s not as much time spent at Hogwarts, not as much magic and spells, yet I still enjoyed it. It is not, by any means, a continuation of the series. It is a standalone play, but we do get to revisit our beloved characters one last time. There was so much nostalgia with this story!

The dialogue is also hilarious. Ron is still as goofy as ever, and Hermione is equally bossy.

“Ron: Honestly, every time I sit down I make an “ooof” noise. An “ooof.” And my feet- thr trouble I’m having with my feet- I could write songs about the pin my feet give me- maybe your scar is like that.”

Page 67

Harry is still same old Harry, and I was very pleased with his relationship with Ginny.

“Harry: I’d do anything for him.

Ginny: You’d do anything for anybody. You were pretty happy to sacrifice yourself for the world.”

Page 277

Oh and Scorpius was darling! I loved his character. His relationship with Albus made me nostalgic for the Ron, Hermione, Harry days.

I also really did love all of the references to Harry’s adventures from his childhood. I experienced some major Harry Potter nostalgia going through this play. The ending was also very poetic, in a way we ended where everything began. Overall, I was pleased with this Harry Potter story. It was a lovely tribute to our favorite characters, and we even learned a little more about some of them. My only regret is that I can’t see it on stage! Maybe one day :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It still brought some of the charm that people felt when they first read the series at least that is what I received after reading through, in the end it is up to everyone else if they shall enjoy a new adventure in a magical world or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Since the last book, nothing has been able to fill the void left by the absence of new books. I prepared my self for what to expect before reading the play, and thus I was not disappointed by the pace or the format of the book. It should be understood that this text is not meant to be another chapter in the Harry Potter series, it's simply a peak into what their lives might currently be like now.

Goes fast.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2016","Despite the size and being in script form, it was actually a really engrossing and fast read which first begins where the 7th book's epilogue ended. I found a lot of the returning characters seemed to be a little, or in some cases quite a lot, out of character from the original series of books in ways that couldn't always be explained away by being older now and having more life experiences. Though, some of them could be and I liked those changes quite a bit.

Some characters we get much more insight into than we did in the original series and their changes make a lot of sense due to that insight. Perhaps the changes that didn't make sense were because of a lack of that sort of insight. There were also a few plot holes I noticed but nothing that was annoying. It's probably important to note that even though this is a book you can pick up and hold, it is really just a script for a play and isn't meant to be considered in the same way a novel would be.

The new characters are engaging and have their own distinct personalities and issues and struggles and are fun to read about. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy especially, which is a good thing considering that they're the main characters for this.

This is an exciting, touching addition to the original series and I find that my money and time were well spent on it. I would absolutely recommend this book. The only reason this doesn't get full stars from me is because I docked a star (I would have docked only half if it would've let me) for the returning characters whose OOC-ness* didn't really get an adequate explanation.

It was well written and stretched my imagination, especially beyond the world of possibilities created in the original Harry Potter series. With that said, though, it does stray quite about from the story line and does it pack as much of a punch. It is noted, though, that this is written from the perspective of a different main character, Harry's son, and in a play format, as opposed to a novel. Overall, well done - 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_394?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=394&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Schmidt","Surprisingly lovely and worth reading, despite haters hating","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2017","I think this book deserves to be on the high end of four stars -- I really liked it.

The only character that was really amiss was Harry, and the main problem there was his dialogue.  He just didn't sound like himself at all until later on and during the scenes with Dumbledore's portrait (who totally WAS himself, far more than Harry was, even though he was just a portrait and apparently wasn't supposed to be really real *rolls eyes*).  But I could still imagine real Harry doing the things he did in this play, just not the way he's portrayed as doing them here.

The rest of the story was wonderful, the time travel sequences deeply affecting and profound (and heartbreakingly hurried), and the idea that this whole production goes on in a staged performance is a bit mind blowing.  I'll have to see it myself.

I loved the new characters, and yes, of course it was all terribly hurried. IT'S A PLAY -- it simply has to cut to the chase.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

And despite that fact, the timeless themes of friendship and finding surprisingly wonderful people in the least likely places (i.e. Draco Malfoy's progeny and the first Potter to be sorted into Slytherin) shined through the imperfections in a wonderful way.  I loved the closure that this story gave readers to Snape and how he would be remembered.  I loved the moment where broken-past-present Draco reflects on his relationship with his wife.  I loved the dialogue between Albus and Scorpius.  I loved Rose Weasley and wished we could have seen more of her.  Hermione as Minister of Magic was a bit tough to swallow (so soon??) but whatever.  Ron was funny.  The trolly lady growing spikes on her hands was a bit much. To be sure, I could imagine her doing something intense and scary to students trying to the leave the train.  It just didn't need to be spike hands  (－‸ლ)

Ok, I could go on.  But I liked it.  There was heart, there was closure, there were beautiful moments with great new characters.  It's not a Harry Potter book like the others, but it was a J K Rowling story worth taking the time for.  I'll likely read it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

This story is written like a screenplay, so if you are expecting a lot of scene development you will be greatly disappointed; however, if you are a TRUE fan of The Potter series this book will just further expand your love for the world of Harry Potter. The story was great, character development ok, scene setting minimal. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't a traditional Harry Potter book you are expecting. I enjoyed the read, but the lack of scene setting seemed almost lazy to me. Either way, JK Rowling creates a wonderful story to further my love for the magical world, and I will continue to read anything she puts out about the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Harry, Hermione and Ron are all grown up with jobs and families of their own. The story revolves around Harry's son, Albus's trials as enters Hogwarts with the legacy of being Harry's son weighing heavily on his young shoulders. Almost Immediately, he befriends  Scorpius, the son of his father's school nemesis Draco Malfoy. The friendship and adventures of these two boys is reminiscent of that of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who are by no means background characters, but central to the story as well.

First, should it have been a book instead of a play?  I would have liked to have had it be a book (or even a series of books, as we could have seen the development of the next generation), as that would have allowed more detail and character development, but the play was OK and if the authors were looking to tell a good story without spending too much time and effort to write a whole book, they succeeded.  The pace moved quickly, I'm sure prompted by the limited time a play would allow, but it kept me involved and there were a sufficient number of surprises to keep me interested.

A lot of people didn't like the people Harry and his friends had become, but I found them to be believable adult developments of the kids we knew from the books.  Was this the only way they could have turned out?  Of course not, but it was one, reasonable, way.  The only one who I didn't like was Ron, whom they made out to be little more than an insignificant, silly and almost meaningless piece of fluff.  Granted, in the books he was the least important of the trio, but he still played a significant role. In the play, they could have left him out entirely and it could only have served to improve things.  On the other hand, I liked the way Harry and Draco interacted.  And Ginny continued to show herself as the marvelous person she was.

The whole thing about time travel - a lot of people didn't like it.  Given that they had introduced time turners in the books, the canon certainly gives credence to the concept and it presented a lot of opportunities for Albus and Scorpius to meet some of the characters from the books and grow to know their parents better, which I think added to the story.  It also presented some alternative timelines that were interesting and helped the boys to learn several important life lessons.

Some said that this didn't seem to be written by J. K., but I thought there was sufficient body to the story and characters that her involvement was clear.  True, it wasn't up to her level of detail and magical fun, but to be fair, I don't know how much more could have been fit into a stage play.  The pace was much too fast for much more development.  As I said before, there were still enough surprises and development that I thought it was reasonably well written.

The gay thing.  First, regarding the boys.  Perhaps it was written a little touchy-feely, but both boys showed interest in girls, so I think their closeness was primarily from intense friendship, caused in no small part by their loneliness and rejection by the other students, and heightened potentially by latent homosexuality generated as a reasonably normal learning about relationships by sensitive young boys.  As far as Dumbledore is concerned, I know J. K. has stated that she always considered him to be gay, but the way he was written in this story, I'm not sure this applied to his feelings for Harry.  If it did, then his feelings toward Harry would likely be beyond simply gay and be more those of a pedophile, which would have gotten him into trouble at some point in his career as a teacher and headmaster.  I think the feelings he expressed toward Harry were more along the lines of the love a father would feel toward his son.

Finally, if I could find a major fault with this story, it is that it was a piece of fluff compared to the books.  In SS, I was drawn into the magical world by wonder and the fun twists and turns of the things Harry encountered as he learned about this world he was born into but didn't know at all.  As the books went on, the story became ever darker and more intense as Harry found himself driven toward his fate.  This made the stories more involved and attractive to older readers, such as myself.  The epilogue in DH was bordering on fluff and a bit less satisfying because it was so nice and predictable.  Upon finishing the play, I found myself feeling much the same way as I felt after finishing DH.  The play's story was enjoyable and drew me in, but the ending left me feeling a little bit sugary.

In summary, then, if you're expecting a story of the intensity and detail of the books, you'll be disappointed; but, if you read it accepting that it is a play and, therefore, must move at a faster, less-detailed pace, I think you'll enjoy the story.  Harry and his friends are still there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"
