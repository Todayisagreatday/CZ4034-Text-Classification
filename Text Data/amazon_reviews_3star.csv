It's not just the descriptions I miss, it's the complexities of the characters. I knew going into this that it's a play - not your typical Harry Potter book. Yet, I still feel as if it's missing the kind of depth that was carefully woven into the original books. For example, the scenes are very short. What could have been beautifully written in a novel format seems to be short changed into a clumpy collection of short sentences within just a few pages. The scenes are not long enough to really feel any connections to the characters. They feel choppy and rushed almost.  The main characters, Albus and Scorpius, have so much potential to blossom into beloved characters, but it's just not shown in this book. Considering this is what most Harry Potter enthusiasts have been waiting for, it just didn't feel up to par for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_157?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=157&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

If you are unfamiliar with a play script you may have been disappointed in the flow. The brilliance of a script is that it allows the director to set the scene and stage when it is put on. I wasn't expecting the in depth detail and description of other Harry Potter books. However, the flow of the book (play) made it overtly obvious that JK Rowling did not write this. She had input but it lacked her special touch.
The story was good. It wasn't the best but it was decent enough for me. I did miss the descriptive writing and wish JK would redo this as a full novel and delve deeper into some of the characters and their relationships. This was a little predictable in the outcome. It was still enjoyable. It just lacked much of the Harry Potter magic we have come to know and love.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

To me, this was a huge disappointment. I'm familiar with scripts and I know they don't read the same way, but this felt like they didn't even try to make it believable. It was lazily written, character development from the other seven books was ignored, and I didn't find the plot believable at all. This books saving grace was the relationship between Scorpius and Albus, it was clear that that was well thought out and it actually felt like it could happen.

This script is basically glorified fanfiction and I wish I could obliviate the memory of reading it, not because I didn't like it but because it causes me to lose respect for the world as a whole. They reveal some things that have no place in the Harry Potter universe (SPOILER his daughter and her mother SPOILER) and because of that I have decided that I'm going to accept this new content as fanfiction instead of an addition to the universe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews","8 people found this helpful"

I was tentatively excited when I heard about the play and then more so when I heard they were releasing the script. Now before you say that I didn’t like it because of the script format, let me just say that I’ve done stage acting in the past and still read Shakespeare for fun. Scripts do not kill my enjoyment of a story, at least not if that script is written well.

This one I would say was written ably, but not precisely enjoyably. It’s one of those “the grammar was excellent, but the story… eh?” moments for me.

I wanted to like this book, y’all; I really did. It just fell flat for me.

I think my big issue was the lack of wonder or hope that the original Harry Potter series held for me. Even during some of the darkest moments of the series, there was still as sense of fun and wonder from Harry discovering the wizarding world and comparing it with the hell that was his life with the Dursleys. This book didn’t feel like it had any of that wonder. Instead we had a rush through 3-4 years of Harry’s son being utterly miserable at Hogwarts followed by a plot driven by one of my least favorite plot tropes. I’m not mentioning what trope here just on the chance some of you are yet to read it – I hate spoilers as much as the next reader LOL. But rest assured, it’s a pretty common plot device, and it just felt tired here as opposed to a unique take on it.

Some have said it read like bad fanfiction, only without the happy ending for any onscreen explicit slash couples, and I have to admit, that’s not an inaccurate description of it.

I do know several people who enjoyed it, but I just was underwhelmed overall. I’ve still got tentative hopes for the FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM film, but this play probably won’t be one I’ll spend my money on in the event that it makes it to US theaters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Mediocre. Okay.","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2016","It was meh. Not necessarily outstanding, but not horrendously unbearable either. Mediocre.
If you look at it as ""the much-awaited final installment to the critically acclaimed Harry Potter series,"" you're sure to be disappointed, because this book definitely did not live up to the hype. It was filled with gaping plot holes, much of it read like fan fiction, and the characters were just caricatures of themselves. Harry has been reduced from the shining, confident young man in the Deathly Hallows to a sniveling, self-pitying, insensitive middle-aged bozo we see in Cursed Child. It’s more torture than the Cruciatus Curse to read about him. Hermione is no better. Now the Minister for Magic (I loved that), she has lost all of her creativity and ingenuity that made her my absolute favorite character in the Harry Potter series. Ron was seriously excruciating. It seemed like he was only in the book for comic relief. While the HP series was interspersed with bits of humor from Ron, Jack Thorne seemed to think that is his only role in the story. It nearly broke my heart. And Albus- why, why, are you SUCH an unlikable character, Albus? I mean, I tried. I honestly tried to like him. But he was so self-pitying, so “Oh-my-god-feel-bad-for-me-I’m-Harry-Potter’s-son” that I wanted to slam him into the nearest brick wall. I mean, he couldn’t even see past his argument with Harry to be a decent friend to Scorpius!! Why, Albus, why?? And Rose
However, there were many things in the book worth the almost-20-dollars that it cost. Scorpius Malfoy was such an amazing character; he and Draco Malfoy were the stars of the story, in my opinion. Albus being sorted into Slytherin was an ingenious touch, though most of us saw it coming. And Draco was SO COOL!! He was hands-down the best character in the book. I’ve always liked Draco, but I really wanted him to become friends with the trio, and it happened!! I was beyond ecstatic. Though most people thought the Time-Turner concept was hackneyed and cringe-worthy, I found it to be somewhat intriguing. The fact that a simple Engorgement Charm could cause Voldemort’s reign to endure was fascinating to me. And that an Expelliarmus Charm could cause Ron and Hermione never to get married? Wonderful. But I groaned aloud when Draco MAGICALLY had another Time-Turner…. Like, seriously? That was such a plot-mover. And Delphi. Seriously, you couldn’t come up with anything better than Voldemort having a daughter?? Really?? The rumor part of it (where everyone thought that Draco was Voldy’s son)- that was cool, and I kind of wished he was so that the plot would be so much more interesting. But no. Delphi, this not-even-remotely-likeable girl, had to be the one who wanted to resurrect the Dark Lord again. I had so many questions at this part that it wasn’t even funny. But Act 4 made it all worth it. I teared up at the ending, and the story made sense logically, after they tied up some loose ends.
So all in all, it was okay. Meh. Definitely not what I expected, but a refreshing twist on the series all the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The climax at the end was underwhelming but since I am such a Harry Potter fan my expectations were very high and it read so quickly it was difficult to connect. I would still recommend this book as I did enjoy the creativeness of taking peeks back in time to meet some of the older characters and adding flavor to the original stories by bringing texture to the original characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Performed well, I might give the production another star, but as a book it suffers significantly. As a screenplay it can come alive when dialog is active, but it is difficult to read any rapidly changing scenes as happens during the setup of the story. It also takes a bit of getting used to when emotion is conveyed via stage direction instead of prose.

Ultimately, the thing that bothered me most is the choice to change how an aspect of magic works, the element that the story is built entirely around. While a fun adventure was birthed from it, we end up with a story that doesn't feel as cleanly crafted or thought out as the previous books or movies.

If you can put aside these two detractors, the story offers a fun trip through nostalgia, a new entry in the joys of friendship, and some touching moments of the relationship between parents and their teenage children.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Unfortunately, it wasn't based on the plot of the story itself. Rather, I found myself wondering, ""Is it fair to rate down an item for being exactly what it says on the tin?""

Ultimately, I decided it was--because of how it was sold. While I enjoyed the story here, as a read it suffered for being precisely what it claimed to be--a rehearsal script. Advice that is given to many aspiring authors is ""show, don't tell,"" but this as a script spent much of its effort telling the actors what to show. That's certainly appropriate for a script, but as a read it felt wanting. And there is the rub for most of the book. I think there really is a good story inside waiting to get out, but without being fleshed out by prose, by a deeper exploration of the characters' thoughts and actions, it doesn't really work overall. I think it probably makes a perfectly serviceable play, but as a read, not so much.

I'm not criticizing scripts per se--I've actually read a novel written in a script format that worked out MUCH better (MCA Hogarth's Spots the Space Marine: Defense of the Fiddler--a different genre but highly recommended)--but in this case, this isn't a novel written in a script format; it's a script sold as a novel. And THERE is the issue I have: This was being marketed like a novel, and it doesn't really stand alone in its own right as that.

I would much rather have had a novelization of the play, or else have this not marketed in hardback with all of the hype and hoopla that surrounded the other Harry Potter releases, but as a special edition paperback. As it is marketed and produced, it doesn't really feel like it matches what is delivered.

As far as the story goes, I have seen people write it off as (sometimes ""bad"") fan-fiction, and claim that the characters are inconsistent. I can certainly sympathize with those claims, and I understand where they come from, but I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that if this script were well-acted, it would alleviate at least some of those concerns. Personally, I enjoyed the tale. But again, the limitations of the format within the medium lend this book to exactly that sort of criticism.

At the end, I am not disappointed with my purchase, but I feel there are numerous ways in which this could have been made better, in the marketing, in the execution, and in the delivery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I had been waiting for this. I was left disappointed.

Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I have read the books countless times. I think they are excellent books for children to read because of what they teach them. Yes, the fantasy is nice, but the core values of the books? The heart of the books are where they really shine. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has taken what we loved about all of these characters and completely obliterated all of that. Harry Potter had many character flaws, but I don't believe for a second that he would have made his son feel unloved or separated him from his only friend. Family was the most important thing to him. Love and friendship were his whole thing.

Then, okay, I can see Hermione Granger being appalled at how poorly the ministry was run. I mean, children broke in multiple times! So, she becomes Minister! Don't you think she'd tighten up security?

The characters didn't seem like more grown up versions of their younger selves. They didn't seem anything like...anything I'd ever read. There seemed to be inconsistencies within the realm as well.

The good news is that by the time I finished this book I surprisingly did not regret reading it. There were many parts throughout reading it though where I wished I never picked the book up. Overall though, I don't consider my $8 purchase of the Kindle book a total waste, though I don't see myself going back to it again. The voices of these characters read like a fan fiction with few fleeting moments of capturing the real magic. The ending resolved everything well enough that you don't finish feeling totally robbed.

*spoilers ahead*
The characters voices were definitely off. There were things I feel JK would have never had characters say to eachother or do. Such as the poly juice potion kiss scene with hermoine. Also, snapes character was very chummy, which did not suit the way he was written for all 7 books! Once they concluded who Delphi was, the book got better for me and it seemed to have a purpose. And I also enjoyed the flash backs to the tri wizard tournament.
I know a play is going to lack the depth of a novel but I still feel like the first half of the plot fell short.
The story focused so much around Albus and Harry that other characters were sloppily thrown together. I doubt Hermoine and Ron would've raised such a snob and bully as Rose was. In fact, Hermoine and Ron's personalities seem to be so lost entirely in this that you wonder if they're actually still friends with harry beyond what they went through in the past. Also, where was James in all of this, or Lilly? James, much like Rose, mostly served to be a bully at the start of the book then fade into the background. Harry and Hermoine were written as very self serving type characters, while Ron was a trophy husband that occasionally served as comic relief. Draco actually seemed to be one the most interesting and likeable characters of this entire book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

First Harry Potter book that I felt doesn't have a strong story line. I know this was a play and it is different than a book, It needed to focus more on the building of Albus and Scorpius's friendship. Being it jumped so many years with Harry, Herminie, Ron, and Ginny as adults,  I think the gaps were too large to make a solid connection with all of those characters.  Professor Dumbeldore needed to be stronger and maybe show a better connection between he and Harry. I personally would have liked it better if it were a book where these characters could be developed better. In the beginning of the play there was too much jumping around and that's where  I feel the two boys friendship could have been developed better in their classes and house.

I was prepared for this, and also prepared for the fact it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling. But in the end, it kinda left me with the feeling of: ""what?""

I love all the Harry Potter books, so very very much, but the bottom line is, this book didn't need to be released, it's meant to be experienced as a play if anything. I haven't seen it, but I hear it's apparently amazing, and hey, maybe it translates better, but overall, and I think many will agree- this feels like a CRAZY fan fiction.

This is for a couple reasons:
-It does so many crazy things, all in one book, that it kind of loses Harry Potter magic, and seems to rely all on shock value. Not only that, but things that also just don't seem believable for the universe. You suspend your disbelief for the first half, but by the end, I wasn't having any of it.

-Nothing new is introduced. What really adds to the fanfic feel, is that nothing new comes into play. There are no new creatures, no new wondrous location, this very much stays in the confines of what's already been laid out, and just seems to go over J.K. Rowling's original impressive world. Only she could introduce new elements into this story, and it's sorely missed here.

-The plot is decent at times, but only because of all the Harry Potter nostalgia it injects. There's nothing really new here, just a ton of fan theories come to realization. And they are the most BASIC of fan theories. The most basic crazy thing you could think of when you finished Deathly Hallows, is probably in this book, it just felt like there was no imagination.

-The plot also has a feel of giving no time for character. Every scene is characters saying: ""it's time to go here"" no real time for character moments. When they strike, they strike hard and well, particularly between Harry and his son.

-Kinda sappy as well. I'm not against the message of friendship and love, but this book gave me some seriously eye rolling moments.

BUT it's not all bad, I'm gonna go SPOILERS now, and this is the stuff I enjoyed:

GOOD:
-Albus: An interesting character, and while him being sorted into Slytherin was very much a ""Ok, this is the thing they're going for moment"" I enjoyed the character himself, not wanting to follow the family legacy.

-Harry Himself: I really did like Harry Potter in this book. Seeing the character, even in his forties, have flaws, and being a bad father and accepting of certain elements of his son he claims to be accepting of, was very well done.

-The Time Travel (to a point): The idea of Albus time travelling and saving Cedric is an idea I very much enjoyed, but the scenes where they actually travel back were too short for anything other than their objective to happen, and that isn't interesting.

-Scorpius and Draco: Scorpius is a fun sidekick to Albus, and I liked seeing him dealing with a family legacy, but in a different way. He added levity, even though it felt unrealistic due to his upbringing. I also really enjoyed hearing Draco's point of view on events. Seeing this character matured felt believable, and his story was tragic and relatable.

-Some Nice Scenes: Scenes like Snape finding out Harry named his son after him, and Harry watching his parents death and savior of him are dramatic scenes I've always wanted to see, and in the end, played out very nicely.

Now the not so good SPOILER stuff:

-Delphi: Like seriously, you're telling me Voldermort did Bellatrix? No, nope, not really

-Voldermort: I also found it kinda lazy the story felt the need to go back to Voldermort as a main threat. The whole point is his arc is over. Find a new threat. Wouldn't it have been a lot more interesting if Albus was the villain alone, or at least his inner demons were?

-Hermione: So Hermione has become exposition lady? Ok, I'm not cool with that.

-Lack of Characters: The cast felt very stilted, I didn't like how in every scene the same 6 characters kept popping up randomly. It just didn't feel like the WIZARDING WORLD, full of fun characters. I get it, it's a play, but it's HARRY POTTER!

-The Resistance: On top of lack of characters, it didn't feel realistic having a ""resistance"" just made up of Ron, Hermione and Snape. It was weird, the characters didn't act like themselves, just weirdness all around.

-The Dialogue: This dialogue was...odd.

SO in the end, Cursed Child has some great moments, but at the end of the day it's fan fiction, that being said, enjoyable fan fiction that I kept reading, so...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I *knew* it was either based on a play or had a concurrent play produced with the same name and I *knew* it wasn't a JK Rowling solo authored work. But somehow I still expected more of a novel. Especially since it's been advertised as the eighth BOOK in the series. It's a great story but it's a pain to read as its awkwardly formatted and poorly edited (I found several typos). I wish JK Rowling and her publishing team could have just had us wait a little longer until the story was fully novelized.

It would be a terrible gateway into the series, it relies heavily on knowing the characters, and as I mentioned, some of them don't quite seem to be themselves, time passing and maturity can't account for the changes.

Then imagine reading just the script of the movie, without the pictures and wonderful visual effects, without the expressions on the faces of the actors -- and of course all the extras that the movie left out are STILL left out....

It was enjoyable to read a new chapter in the world of Harry Potter. For that, i am grateful. This story, however, has two primary plot holes that made the character motivations feelvunrealistic.

1) Why was Albus so focused on saving Cedrick Diggory? This was the entire premise of the book, and it just felt like a reach to me that someone who he'd never met could motivate him so much to jump off a train, flee campus, and go back in time.  Perhaps if it were rewritten there could have been a stronger motivation from Scorpius? I didn't buy Albus's, though.

2) Once they returned, after rectifying the past, why did Scorpius lie about having the timeturner to the older wizards? It seemed to me like they had learned their lesson after returning. For Scorpius to ""take matters into his own hands,"" it just feels out of character for ""timid Scorpius"" and overall it is at odds with what it seems they've learned from the first half of the book when they went back in time.

The two above details are incredibly important because they motivate progression in the book, so for me not to believe them, i couldn't buy into the rest of the book.

Again, it was enjoyable to re-experience the characters, but otherwise this did not live up to the Harry Potter name.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I've purchased every book (hardcover or Kindle), almost every DVD, every HD-DVD, every BluRay and went to every movie but this time I feel a little screwed by JKR. Was this laziness? Knowledge that her fan base would buy the book no matter how flimsy the structure?

I was disappointed with the length and really the story line when it came to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Jenny. I know this book is the screen play to the play that was done in London but I think it could have been better. These characters who have been through so much when they were young were made to seem so weak. At least that's how I see it and that's why I am giving this 3 stars.

(E.g. 40-year-old Hermione guards a top-secret artifact with three grade-school level riddles. The Trolley Witch is actually the Terminator. Polyjuice potion takes a month to brew, but the excuse to not use it is that they can just transfigure Harry into Voldemort because plot convenience. How did Albus get his wand back to fight Delphi? Why was Ron morphed into Fred Lite?! Wait, so Cedric becomes a DEATH EATER out of embarrassment? Convenient spilling of love potion and magical reaction on a blanket to send a message forty years into the future!!! Aaaaand the list goes on.)

Ahem. My point: next to everything felt contrived. The writers *not Rowling, she did not write it but did endorse it* simply reused the premise of Prisoner of Azkaban (which, in my humble opinion, had the weakest plot lines of all HP books), threw in some dramatics and teenage angst from an unlikeable and underdeveloped main character (Albus Potter), and rehashed Voldemort. Again. The book's saving grace was Scorpius Malfoy, whom I absolutely adored. He alone would have gotten five stars. He was engaging and funny, and the only character within the context of the story I cared about at all.

But I ramble.  A rating of three stars suits this goofy, vapid read because as I said, it was fun and enjoyable; but overall, it lacked depth and the kind of storytelling magic JK Rowling turns out. Also, Scorpius. I could read eight books about him and Albus (because come on, despite my dislike of Albus, the bromance between the two was still adorable) and enjoy them no matter how wreckless the plot was; which is probably why I didn't give the book 1 star. The plot itself is hackneyed and lacking, but at the very least I got a few laughs from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","8 people found this helpful"

C Glover","Uninspired play that does not add much to the Harry Potter World","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2016","Overall: The story was moderately interesting.  It involves time travel which can be very interesting if done well.  But, this was not done particularly well.  You knew what was going to happen by definition -- no other way than to suddenly change Harry Potter Canon material which is not going to happen with this play.

The writing style / dialog style was a bit off putting for me.  I really did not like the Ron and Hermaine's tone.  The way the characters were portrayed in the future was not very flattering.  I know it is supposed to interject the grind of real life but why do I want too much real life if my escapist reading?

The concept of Voldamort having a child is interesting.  Frankly, if she wanted to really have her revenge then she could have easily done it on the hapless characters in this book.

The content from the play could be an interesting addition to the Harry Potter canon but it needs to be rewritten and definitely not as a play.

I was expecting more for the book.  Harry Potter material does not work particularly well as a play in general anyway.

Summary:
If you are looking for a Harry Potter reading fix, then pick it up but prepared to be annoyed with the play and the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

This book starts at a time several years later than when book 7 took place, yet the action time travels through much of Potter lore as it attempts to explain why certain events needed to happen as they did.

In this book, Harry and Ginny have three children, and at the start of the book, their second son, Albus, is starting at Hogwarts. Against most odds, Albus, and Draco's son, Scorpius, become best friends. Scorpius develops a crush on Ron and Hermione's daughter Rose. Both Albus and Scorpius feel the weight of being their father's sons, albeit in different ways. For some reason, Albus decides that he needs to save Cedric Diggory from death during the Tri-Wizard Tournament--but his attempts bring about changes that he never imagined and lead to a confrontation of the families against Voldemort and his daughter to ensure that their future remains intact.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_151?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=151&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Another Harry Potter story! In a very unconventional form.

The Cursed Child is about Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, the children of Harry and Draco respectively, and their first few years at Hogwarts dealing with their lineages.  It is also about and adult Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron as they deal with their lives as parents.  This book really focuses on the relationship between parent and child, and what it means to be a good father or son.

First of all, this really isn't another Harry Potter book.  It lacks the magic that the original seven had, but that's not that surprising upon reflection since this is a play and Rowling isn't the main author.  It's her story, yes, but Jack Thorne is a playwright, so really, it's his writing.  And since it's his writing, and intended for the stage, it just doesn't come off the page like I was hoping.  Rather than being relaunched into the favorite world of my childhood it was like reading poor fan fiction.

Beyond getting the voices of the characters pretty much completely wrong, a bunch of unnecessary cameos, a storyline that made only the littlest of sense, and a strange (and disliked) turn of events at the very end, this wasn't a horrible book.  It just let me (and I'm sure quite a few others) down.

I don't want to spoil anything so I'm not going to go into what I really disliked about the book here.  If you want to rant, though, hit me up on twitter and I'll share all my in-detail problems with their full spoiler glory. (shameless twitter promotion: @tsundokusam)

Here's what I did like: the new characters.  Albus and Scorpius are gems!  Scorpius in particular will now always have a special place in my heart because he's absolutely adorable and just precious.  I liked the beginning of the book and what happens when Albus gets to school.  I also really liked Rose, though I wish we could have spent more time with her character.  The relationship between Ron and Hermione was pretty cute, too, and Ginny and Harry are really given the opportunity to show us why they fell in love.

Returning to the Wizarding World has been great, but it seems that it missed out a lot of what we wanted.  Here's to hoping Fantastic Beasts does a much better job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I understand this is written in script format, but I expected something more given the fact that JK Rowling's name was written on the cover. There seemed to be so much lack of setting the scene and character development. This fell utterly short of what I love about the works JK Rowling had previously published.

L. Gribble","Excellent characters, but not the adventure I would have wanted to see them in","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2016","Like many readers, I had a difficult time falling in love with the play that continued the story of the both the original and next generation of wizards from the Harry Potter universe. Since I hadn't read anything in script form in over a decade, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out whether my problem was with the unfamiliar storytelling style. Unfortunately, I finally had to admit that while there was much to enjoy about this tale, the rest of it came up lacking.

Though Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite of the original novels in the Harry Potter series, which I know is true of many other readers, what I loved about it wasn't the time travel aspect. While it was interesting to see different versions of a future with a grown Harry Potter and companions, it detracted from a story that should have been about the relationships between parents and children.

On the other hand, I loved reading about a Potter sorted into Slytherin House and a Malfoy who wasn't at the top of the totem pole. These were the sort of different futures I wanted to read about, not awkward encounters made even more gimmicky through the use of Polyjuice Potion.

Though the character was intriguing, I saw the major reveal regarding the main villain miles away. In the end, while I loved the new characters, I'm disappointed that this was the adventure that we saw them in. So as I happily add Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to my personal Harry Potter canon, I'm afraid that this play will linger on the outskirts, keeping company with other exceptionally good Harry Potter fanfic that is fun to read once and never really remember.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling’s novels end. Arguably, this script should not be seen as the “eighth book” in the series, but rather an added bonus. The story follows Harry Potter’s middle child, Albus. Albus enters Hogwarts expecting an experience like his father’s full of heroism and success. However, what he finds is something entirely different. Albus befriends the rumored son of Voldemort, Scorpius, Malfoy’s son. They struggle through Hogwarts as outcastes who do not live up to what society wants them to be. After Albus overhears a conversation Harry, now a ministry worker, has with a supposed old acquaintance who wants to bring his son back from the dead, Albus and Scorpius secretly embarks on a mission of their own to become heros. However, their plan ultimately backfires, and the boys learn a hard lesson when the reality of the future is ever changed by their actions. The boys, along with their parents, fight to save the new world from dark magic and restore life. The play tells the tale of identity, friendship, and family. The script is very well crafted. The playwrights hit many subjects fans of the Harry Potter series have been dying to find out about. However, the play can be perceived as fan fiction as it was not written by the original author and does not contain the same vibe as the original novels. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the script, is that not all characters are true to the novels. Dumbledore, once a wise, brave man, is portrayed as weak and selfish which is a huge let down. Ron Weasley is portrayed as the ‘dumb’ friend, and George Weasley is entirely left off from the play. Overall, the story was exciting and kept me entertained, and the message the story has is very valuable meaning. I think it is worth the read for Harry Potter fans, but one does need to accept the play is not necessarily the reality of the Harry Potter series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Some of the stage directions include characters feeling ""overwhelming fear,"" ""sinking feeling in pit of stomach,"" while things and characters are levitating on every other page. Someone actually executed all this on a stage? And if I have to read ""time...turns over, thinks a bit..."" one more time.
I would never want to see this play performed live.
The story is a little better. Voldemort is rumored to be coming back but, never fear, the millennial wizarding generation is here to save us all.
There is so much time traveling in this book, Doc Brown and Marty are crying their eyes out somewhere.
All of the male characters are in love with each other while the female characters don't really contribute much to the overall plot.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Appropriate for Harry Potter fans of all ages, this script contains no swearing, nothing offensive. Read it just to say you did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I mean, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't all that compelling. I did think I'd like to see the play if only to see how they would handle all the quick scene changes but, other than that, it certainly didn't come anywhere close to matching the magic and excitement of the original series.

I read the spoilers so knew what was coming but the blow of it still sucks. There are so many plot holes and go-backs on canon that my head spins. I keep trying to make sense of all the mistakes but I just can't. I am so sad. On a bright side there is some really cool bits with hermione and Ron - they prove that their love for each other makes each other the best version of themselves. I also love that scorpius is such an awesome geeky goofball and is a mixture of Harry, ron and hermione so albus really lucked out getting him as his friend. Albus was angsty and angry but that's not a character flaw though. I like that he's angsty I just didn't like him so much - pure slytherin narscisist haha. Anyway it's not a bad story, it's not good though and I'm surprised Jk Rowling approved this story and says it's canon when it goes against many other things she says is canon.

It absolutely does, and here's why:

-The play basically takes every ""what if"" and applies it to this nonsensical story.
""What if this person showed their face again?""
""What if this person had a kid?""
""What if this person lived?""
""What if this person was eviilllllll?""
It's a little much. And the villain? Geez, really? I really can't consider them canon. It doesn't even make sense. There is no way the villain would even exist. (This probably makes more sense, if you've read the play. Staying spoiler-free!)

-The play seems to completely disregard its own universe's established rules.
I'm talking about the (potential spoiler) flipping time travel. The Harry Potter series has always used the Novikov self-consistency principle; you cannot change the past through time travel, you can only fulfill it. Yet in the play, if you go back in time and mess with stuff, you're gonna see major consequences. If this type of time travel is possible, SOMEONE would have at least SUGGESTED in the books to use it to destroy Voldemort before he posed a threat.

-Many of the characters don't seem like themselves.
I'm lookin' at you Harry. I was honestly rooting for Draco in this play, which is not something I ever thought I'd do.

Some good things:
-It's a quick read. It doesn't drag on, so if you still want to read it, you won't drudge through. It took me about 5 hours.
-Some of the stage directions were amazing. I know that may seem trivial, but the way they were described had me imagining sitting in the theater, watching it unfold. And it was great.
-Scorpius. He rocks.
-Some scenes are good. Yes, most of it reads like fanfiction, but some things that happen actually make sense, and I liked seeing their impact, although I wish the Hogwarts years were expanded upon. I was actually really curious to see more of how the kids handled school.

So. I give it three stars, because it's alright as a standalone play. In terms of how it fits in with the Harry Potter storyline... eh... it's not great. I feel bad saying that, but it really wasn't the story it could've been.
Give it a read, see for yourself. Maybe you'll love it!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's what I was expecting based on the description and, since it's been several years since I've read in that format, I thought it might be rather fun. What I didn't particularly care for were the tempo and the story line itself. Knowing that this was written to be performed live on stage and having spent much of my younger days in both school and community theater, I found many of the scenes ridiculously short. I also found the dialogue quite mundane and the story line itself didn't feel in keeping with the seven Potter novels. Fortunately, it was a very quick read so I was able to get through it and set it aside quickly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_123?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=123&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It was way too light. It covered way too much time. We didn't get to know the characters like we did in the real books because the play covers way too much ground in way too little time. The Minister of Magic thing was irritating and doesn't even match Rowling's writing on Pottermore. The reader can see glimpses of Rowling here and there,  but it is fleeting, and not enough to carry the story. Dumbledore...sobbing? The whole scene was a mess and a complete deviation from his character. The sentence structure wasn't even on point with his character. It was a light read; much too light to really be considered part of the Rowling dynasty.

So much is left to the imagination at it takes a lot of pondering to eke out the nuances so easily described in words. Given Rowling's immense talent for exposition, this book is like watching a Harry Potter movie through cellophane, you can get the story, but something is clearly lacking.

I get that this is a stage play and that they published the script. However, a stage play is all about visuals that are not necessarily spelled out in the script. Likewise, a book has a lot of color and descriptions to set the scene. This book is not an adaptation. It's the script. Period. No color, few descriptions of scenes, very little to get the imagination going. It's dull and lifeless. More time should have been spend translating this to book form.

The other title I was going to give this review is ""Hail! Hail! The Gangs all Here!""  Because, wow! The ENTIRE gang is all here. Even the ones who died in the battle of Hogwarts get to make an appearance. I heard one reviewer call this book fluff for the Potter fan club. That certainly fits.

Tomer","very different from original series, but read it anyway","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2016","While it IS a must read for fans of the HP series, it is very different.  Characters do not seem well developed... for a while I reminded myself it is much harder to develop characters in a play (we are all aware this is a play, right?  In fact, maybe two... or just one in four acts).  [mild spoilers ahead?]  But even many of the familiar characters seem relegated to serve as plot devices... this one to insert humorous lines even though he/she is too smart to say them; that one to serve as the voice of authority even though he/she appears less mature than in the novels.  The plot might even be a little strained for the purpose of including a number of unexpected (i.e. deceased) characters from the novels.  A family member described it as a lot like a fan fic.
All that is not to say it isn't imaginative and dark and a welcome exploration of some of the emotional issues confronting old and new characters.  Someday I expect I will try to see a performance just to see how the scripted effects will look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's like taking all of the descriptive sentences out of a novel and hoping it still works, it doesn't. I knew it was going to be a script, but thought there would have been more stage direction to fill in the blanks. For example, if you didn't know the characters this would be hopeless as you have no idea who or what are these characters.

The story itself isn't terrible, but we expect much more from Rowling. It's all a little predictable. Due to the nature of the story (avoiding spoilers!) much of it seems to be a repeat of the early books and therefore doesn't have that surprising content that each of the seven books provided.

I'm not sure of the input Rowling had with this project, but I'd suggest that she publicly clarifies her role.Having her name connected with this project isn't very complimentary.

Rowling's touch","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2017","3.5 stars

This eighth book in the Harry Potter series is the script of a play that originally opened in London's West End in 2016. The play harks back to occurrences in the original series so the reader needs to be familiar with those books to fully appreciate the story.

""Cursed Child"" opens 19 years after Lord Voldemort's defeat. By now, Hermione is Minister for Magic; Ron runs Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes; Harry is Head of Magical Law Enforcement; and Ginny is a sports writer for The Daily Prophet.

Harry and Ginny's middle child, Albus Severus Potter, is starting his first year at Hogwarts and - against all odds - is put into Slytherin. Albus becomes best friends with his fellow Slytherin, Scorpius Malfoy - the son of Draco and his wife Astoria.

Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley is also a first year student at Hogwarts, placed into Gryffindor. Rose disapproves of her cousin Albus hanging out with Scorpius because she associates Scorpius with death eaters, and thinks he's a sketchy guy.

Jump ahead three years and Albus, Scorpius, and Rose are about to begin their third year at Hogwarts. Rose fits in very well at the school, where she's popular and a good Quidditch player. Albus and Scorpius, however, are having a rough time: Albus because he feels pressured by being the son of 'famous Harry Potter', with whom he has a very fractious relationship; and Scorpius because rumors abound that he's really the son of Lord Voldemort. In addition, Scorpius is grieving from the recent loss of his mother. Albus and Scorpius are on the edge of rebellion and have a strong desire to prove themselves - and Albus knows just what to do.

While he was home for the previous summer break, Albus overheard some things. First, contrary to the belief that all the Time-Turners were destroyed during the 'Battle of the Department of Mysteries', Harry recently confiscated an illegal one.....and Hermione hid it at the Ministry of Magic. Second, Amos Diggory - having heard a rumor about the Time-Turner - dropped in on the Potters. He implored Harry to go back in time and save his son Cedric, who was killed by Lord Voldemort after he was a co-winner (with Harrry) of the Triwizard Tournament. Harry strongly denied he had a Time-Turner and Amos went away mad, accompanied by his niece/caretaker Delphi.

So.....Albus and Scorpius hatch a plan while they're traveling to school on the Hogwarts Express. They jump off the train, team up with Delphi, and steal the Time-Turner from Hermione's office via clever use of polyjuice potion. The boys then go back in time to make sure Cedric doesn't win the Triwizard Tournament - which presumably will save his life. Of course any diddling with the past reverberates through the future, and the boys' machinations have massive - and unfortunate - results. The boys try to go back and fix things - several times - but end up making everything worse.

Meanwhile, Harry, Ginny, and Draco are informed that their sons aren't at school, and form an uneasy alliance to find the boys - assisted by Ron and Hermione. This is a very 'grown-up' development considering the previous animosity (to put it mildly) between Draco and Harry. The play is realistic in its depiction of difficult family dynamics: Harry (try as he might) can't seem to connect with Albus, who feels like odd man out in his famous/gifted family. And Draco, though he's a loving father, appears to be on a different wavelenth from his boy Scorpius - who's a gentle, unassuming lad. (He should probably be a Hufflepuff.... LOL.) Scorpius even has a crush on Rose, which is a sweet, amusing touch.

And that's about all I can say about the plot without spoilers.

Many characters from the original series make an appearance - including dementors - and it was fun to see them. (Well.....the dementors aren't that much fun .....)

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and I enjoyed the play. The plot is clever, the characters are smart, and there's a nice surprise twist. That said, the story, which was conceived by J.K. Rowling and written by Jack Thorne, lacks the depth, breadth, an ingenuity of the original books. Partly, this is because a play is less detailed than a novel, but also because it doesn't have Rowling's 'touch' (IMO).

Also, the characters' repeated trips to the past give the play a repetitious vibe. When I compare this work to the screenplay 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them', which Rowling wrote herself, I find that 'Fantastic Beasts' is more artful and entertaining.

Still, I highly recommend 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' to fans of the series. If you're a Potterphile, it's a must read!

(Note: I just love the name 'Scorpius'.....It's inspired!)","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The characters in the play do not properly reflect the characters in the Harry Potter series, and the plot was a bit ridiculous and unbelievable (I mean, Harry Potter's plot line is 100% believable in the wizarding world, whereas the plot of this play was just not believable in the wizarding world of Harry Potter). If you approach this book from a stance that you might approach Harry Potter fan fiction, you will enjoy it much more and be a lot happier with the characters/plot.
From a non-Harry Potter standpoint, the play itself was very funny. The characters are hilarious, and some situations are just weird/funny.

After finishing this on release day (short, under four hour read for me...a generally average reader in speed), I initially clicked the 4 stars while hesitating between 3 and 4. I am now switching to a 3 because the more I think about it, once nostalgia wears off you're left with something somewhat acceptable but not very memorable.

I'm sure the play is entertaining with great lighting and effects, but in terms of reading this play as a book, there are times where the dialogue is lacking and the characters don't feel like the characters we know from the seven novels...the story also takes some liberties with new developments that although I'm completely fine accepting, I was surprised to see the direction. And there were some beloved characters that didn't seem to get the treatment they deserved.

All in all, I had a smile on my face during some parts of reading this and was happy to have a chance to experience the play without being able to see it in London, but when I look back on the Harry Potter series, this will be more or less a footnote-worthy licensed side story (that J.K. Rowling may not have had a whole lot to do with), and not part of the main canon I remember.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

I fully confess to being a major Harry Potter fan, I love the series and I have spent far more money than I should have collecting all manner of fan merchandise not to mention the countless hours I've spent rereading the books and binge watching the movies. So obviously I was over the moon excited when I first heard about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and I preordered it the moment it appeared on Amazon. I'll admit I was a little disappointed that it was only being published in script version and not as a full novelisation and it definitely took a little while to get used to the different format but that was the least of my problems with this book so it hardly seems worth mentioning.

I was really looking forward to meeting the new generation of witches and wizards, sure I was expecting to see Harry, Ginny, Ron & Hermione in supporting roles as loving parents but I wanted the focus to be on the children. There are endless directions that this story could have taken and I have to say in the beginning I was just so thrilled to be back in this world that I was enjoying every minute of it. I loved the first meeting between Albus and Scorpius, I enjoyed their journey to Hogwarts and the sorting hat ceremony was great. But then it all started to feel a little repetitive, as much as those scenes fly by fairly quickly they were just too close to the original story and I was waiting for the characters to veer off in their own direction.

Unfortunately instead of something fresh and exciting we got a rehash of old plot lines, worse than that we had the books we know and love turned upside down and the rules of the universe were completely changed to make that possible. Things that were impossible in the original books were suddenly happening easily in the new story, people we know and adore were acting completely out of character and others who could have had really interesting tales to tell weren't even included. You'd be forgiven for thinking that Harry only had one child not three for all that we saw of the other two and I actually found myself not liking Harry very much which was nothing short of shocking. Ron and Hermione were no better and Ginny might as well have been completely absent for all the use she was. I'd rather have had a brand new story where the original characters just waved their kids off at platform 9 and 3/4 and weren't seen again until the holidays (a bit like the Weasley parents who had minor but loveable roles in the earlier books) than have them turn into cardboard cutouts of themselves.

I'm just left feeling a little bit heartbroken that a story that could have been amazing managed to fall so flat. Don't get me wrong it isn't all bad, revisiting Hogwarts is always a treat and I absolutely adored Scorpius (who'd have thought I'd find myself loving a Malfoy!). I also think that the script format doesn't help with the characterisation so I'm hoping that seeing it in play format will help bring the characters to life more. I didn't love the book but I'm still very excited that I have tickets to the play, even if I do have to wait until June next year to see it! I just hope that if J.K. Rowling decides to write (or approve) any further stories set in this world she won't continue to keep messing with the original plotlines. The wizarding world is a huge and wonderful place so surely there are a million new directions she can take us.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It's also written, partially, as a play. Something of a hybrid between a full on screen-play and a regular novel. I honestly dislike plays and had a friend who wrote screen-plays for television shows that everyone called brilliant and I couldn't get into the writing style. 'The Cursed Child' was a bit easier on the eyes and left out a lot a true screen-play would contain.
The story was good. We're somewhere in the future, years pass quickly until the end of the story draws close. The older characters are still believable as who we knew them as.

I was able to wrap my brain around the format. That was ok, if not slightly annoying. It just doesn't have the same feel or depth as its predecessors. I'm glad to have read it.

It was very torn about whether or not I should read this new one after seeing all of the reviews. But I figured with all the time I have put into the original novels I needed to read this one. I finished it in one night. It was not a long or complicated read. I went into it knowing that a lot of people did not like it end that it was going to be different than the original novels.  I was surprised to find that the plot focused on an aspect of been covered in many different books, TV shows and movies. Time traveling .  I was able to easily predict several outcomes in the book. That is what I found disappointing. Despite this, I'm glad that I decided to read it. If you are a Harry Potter fan then you should read it. Do not let any bad reviews scare you away.

I knew it was a play script, so it would read differently than Rowling's books. But I expected it to have  more life to it than it did. The plot wasn't bad, but it would have worked better as a book that Rowling wrote by herself than as a combined effort between her and a theater writer and director.

This is basically the story of the children of Harry and Ginny Potter, Ron and Hermoine, and Draco Malfoy and their adventures at Hogwarts. They do plenty of magic and battle evil as you might expect, but the story could have been much more engaging than it was. It felt like the same ground being covered again and again.

 This is not the Potter you know and love and for many have read the books and seen the movies more times then you can count.
The charters of the story did not seam like they where who they where in the previous books this did not read or feel like a traditional Harry Potter. And not just because it was written as a play something that you quickly adjust to.
As many of the other Reviews say this feels like a fanfic due to a lot of things and is still a good read but by no means matches the previous seven books we had developing the Harry Potter world.
This is a okay edition to the Harry Potter world but you in no way leave it feeling the same way about Albus as you did about Harry in Book 1.
Really the hardest parts of this is to get over how fast the time is paced it moves by really quickly and this is probably for the play's sake of not going on for 5hrs but it makes it and awkward read.
This books has a lot of good in it to there are some parts that are really funny and some others that make your inner wizard/witch full of cheer and anticipation. This is after all a HARRY POTTER book we can't not be happy about it.
I do think if this is played of well on stage it could be a very well preformed play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

As it is a script, the reading experience is really different because almost everything is dialogue with few descriptions, because of this the book is really fast paced, and easy to read.

I think I feel dragged toward bad guys because I totally loved Draco, better than the full grown up Harry, and I loved his son, Scorpius, he was my favorite character, he is really sweet while Albus is all bitter. Draco and Scorpius relationship is complicated, but it felt real and I love how they got close in the end. On the other hand Harry’s and Albus’ relationship was really bad, and even thou they overcome it in the end, I still felt them strained, and harry was a bad parent sometimes, there was a moment where Albus did something stupid (it’s all he does) and Harry blames Scorpius saying he is a bad influence to Albus and wants him away from his son, not caring he is the only friend Albus has.

James and Lily don’t appear much in the book, but I would’ve liked to see Harry’s relationship with his other two kids. I really liked Hermione’s and Ron’s relationship, but I totally despised their daughter, Rose, she was like the mean girl at school, and believed herself to be better than others just because she was Granger-Weasley (yeah, I don’t know why she used Hermione’s last name first, and… why she always needed to say both last names?)

There were some inconsistencies in the plot regarding things told in the books, for example they prepared polyjuice potion super fast when it took Hermione months in the second book. Things were conveniently easy to Albus’ crew sometimes, it seemed like destiny wanted them to do stupid things, c’mon, the security at Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic was super weak, Albus’ crew could get in and leave really easily. There were moments in which I couldn’t believe what was happening, it seemed like a cliché and predictable unnecessary drama, and suddenly Cedric was like the most loved and important person in the world, all this drama it’s his fault.

It was a light read and I enjoyed it, but I think it lacked the magic Harry Potter had, and I didn’t like the way the authors managed certain things, if you like harry potter then you’ll enjoy it, but as for me, I won’t take it as canon, it’s more like a fanfic blessed by J.K Rowling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Reading “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is like going back to a familiar world.  “It’s nice to see you again, Harry, and good to be back at Hogwarts.”  I give this book a 4.5*.

As an avid Harry Potter fan, I had wondered how a story 2 decades later would use the villain whose name we learnt could not be uttered.  Voldemort was dead.  Killed by Harry Potters.  An epic 7-book story ensured that the nail was fully on his coffin, or be it a pile of smoke that was all left of him.  All I will say is that the authors have brought an interesting take on how to bring back the old conflict.

We are re-introduced to all the old, familiar, famous characters of the Harry Potter books.  We are well-acquainted with the familiar devices that bring dead individuals back to life – the Pensieve, pictures – along with a new device in book 8 of the Harry Potter series.

There are the memorable settings, such as the rooms and staircases of Hogwarts, The Forbidden Forest, and the Ministry of Magic’s offices.

There are the other hallmarks of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter world.  Her witty humour.  The unexpected twists and turns.  The mysteries.  The outsider children, who have to make their way in the world.  The ingenious solving of problems.  The scar.  Even the riddles.  I loved them all.

What didn’t I like so much?  Without giving it away, I did feel there was a deus ex machina embedded there, though it took me overnight before I came to that conclusion.  Also, Harry Potter turns to tears far too often.  Ginny never did have as much spunk as the trio we love so much, and she doesn’t have much of a character reveal in this book either.  But most markedly the explanations of her world that JK does so well are missing in this play.  The world is mentioned but I would have loved to read another 200 pages explaining it, the new devices and the magic.

But Hermione and Ron, Harry of course do themselves proud.  The new cast that we are introduced to, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, are delightful additions to the Harry Potter fold.

Could there be another story or play with these characters in the Harry Potter series?  I can’t imagine another way of introducing Voldemort.  But then I didn’t see Book 8’s way of re-imagining him.  So you never know.  I would love to read Book 9 if there were one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

However, I did laugh and I cried. I've got two quotes from the script for you that sum up the plot and the point:

...there is only one truth we can't escape: That somewhere in our past a witch is trying to rewrite everything we ever knew ...

...there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world...

I enjoyed seeing some old relationships got better, or sweeter. I also truly enjoyed seeing the next generation begin to flourish into wonderful people. But I really thought it was too far fetched to be ""true"" to the cannon in the 7 novels. The time turners, Delphi, prophecies... and Lily and James...that wasn't very nice!

It focuses on Albus the son of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley, Rose Granger-Weasley the daughter of Ron and Hermione and Scorpius Malfoy the son of Draco. Including the title characters this pretty much sums up the Character List of Cursed Child. When the children are ready to set off to Hogwarts for their first trip, you end up remembering the first time you ready Philosophers Stone. Envisioning Hogwarts for the first time, again. It's a truly fantastic way to start the storyline. Nostalgic, yet new.

You see the characters in such a different light, they're not the child-but-nearly-adult characters we all know and love. They're over worked, underpaid Adults with no real oomph about them anymore. It's almost like they've had adulthood knock the magical essence from them.

When Albus gets to Hogwarts and realises being 'The Son of Harry Potter' might be a weight to heavy to bear he starts to wish his parents were someone else. Someone less known. Just to make his life a little bit easier, and when Albus is sorted into Slytherin, al hell breaks lose in the Potter world.

I read Cursed Child completely blind all I knew was that it was based on the children, not the main characters from the HP world. Although they do still play a big part it's a great way of seeing the characters we know so well, so different. JK Rowling has created a world within a world, bringing back the nostalgic memories of the childhood novels we came to live, mixed with new coming of age characters makes for a fantastic quick read. There's new, there's old, there's both together. It's everything you want in a spin off story.

I'd only give Cursed Child 3.5* I really thought there was more this book could give. The story could have gone a little deeper, given a little more. The most disappointing part for me would have to have been the ending, I felt everything tied up too quickly with a big red bow so to speak.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I was happy with the the development of the characters but there were not enough to have the effect to make this seem believable in the Harry Potter and Wizarding World. The plot was too large that it needed the other characters to build the story. The literature and fantasy came together well though when Harry confronts Dumbledore and the cloak of invisibility. The fantasy of just magic in general is really well put together still allowing readers to feel as if it is true and happens in today's world due to all of the familiarities. The time turners and the prison was very unique in the way that it creates a picture in your head and you are able to imagine it and be able to picture Harry time traveling. All in all, this book was a continuation off of the end of Deathly Hollows and it would be a great read for all Harry Potter fans. It still has the internal logic, consistency, and unique settings that J.K. Rowling brings to the table. I would recommend it to grades 6/7 and up. :)","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I've said this before when being critical of other Fanfiction authors, in this media you have to describe the environment and scene that you're writing about. Being it's a script for a theater play, it didn't have a lot of environment context in the story. To be honest, I don't think JKR wrote a good deal of this Script. In fact, most of her writings were borrowed from the last chapter in Book 7 or from her own notes about how Lilly and James died and an odd character like the lady who delivers candy on the Hogwarts Express. Only JKR could have that much background details concerning a bit character in the HP Universe. The rest I can safely say was John Tiffany and Jack Thorne who are both accomplished theater writer and theater director respectively. I can only assume that they gave the Prop / Stage Manage a great deal of free-reign to decide what goes where and how it looks to the theater audience. According to London reviews a great many Theater critics describe the changing magical background scenes as ""ground-breaking"". Which if that's the case, makes Tiffany and Thorne a pair of geniuses for not ""cementing"" the background in the Script. Great for Theater, not great for readers of a hardback in Panera Bread.

But enough of the lack of JKR touches, what about our Trio and their children. Eh... not so much. I think Charlie Weasley, a minor character, had more lines in Book 4 or even Book 3 than did the siblings that weren't Albus Severus Potter, Scoripus Malfoy, and to some small degree Rose Granger-Weasley. Other than the last chapter of Book 7, which is almost copied word for word, you never hear from the other children... at all - for the rest of the story. I think anybody else who reads that would've like to have read more. There are some good points to mention. First, is the endless time dimensional reality love of Ron and Hermione. The time period changed repeatedly but the love dynamic never really changed between them. In fact, when they weren't married to one another in a different time reality both were worse off and yet they still felt as if there was still something that should've been shared between them. Which is sure to drive the Draco - Hermione or the Harry - Hermione shippers insane. Not even in a different time reality do you have a Harry - Hermione marriage. Imagine that.

One question that always had me wondering since Book 7 was definitively answered. If for say, Harry decided not to return and instead decided to stay with Prof. Dumbledore behind the veil at the mystical train station what would come of Voldemort, the War, and Ron and Hermione. Hermione becomes a failed leader of the resistance with Ron and Severus at her side. Truly Harry is needed to defeat Voldemort and win the war.

Side notes: Ron was treated a bit poorly as a funny and brave sidekick. Hermione is the Minister of Magic, Harry the Chief of Magical Law Enforcement, and Ron owns a Joke Shop. No mention of Ron ever being an Auror for a time before taking over at WWW with George.

As for the Lead of the story, Albus Severus Potter, at first, I didn't really liked our Protagonist. Albus, was a Slytherin and it showed more so than Scoripus Malfoy. However, I must admit he grew on me. Albus showed himself more Harry Potter than adult Harry Potter. My favorite character, hands down, was the calm, rational, and good Scoripus Malfoy. He should've been a Gryffindor and not a Slytherin. I think in the Malfoy clan, he would've been a Black sheep of the family. Even funnier was his unrequited liking of Rose Granger-Weasley. Who to me was about as stuck up as you can imagine. I did not like Rose at all. She inherited all the ambitions of Hermione and the Quidditch abilities of Ron and none of the humility of either.

Quite simply this was a story of the relationship of Father, Harry Potter, and Son, Albus Potter. It showed a dramatic and realistic approach, but I never could truly sympathize with either. I guess this makes them realistic and a bit disappointing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

I'm only halfway through, mind you, but this is nowhere near a typical Potter tale. The characters do not feel right at all, and the notations and descriptions are so extremely vague and poorly imagined that it probably makes for a somehow worse stage play. Describing something along the lines of ""a group of witches and wizards gathered and they rattle and chatter like only true witches and wizards can"" is like trying to be cute on a 3rd grade essay about a book you never read. Just. Lazy. The idea of the story seems like it could work, but I don't get the reasoning behind why the plot was even necessary. On the plus side, the 2 page ""chapters/scenes"" make for an easy rifle through changing the book from a 300 page romp into, realistically, more like a 100 page short story. Not bad for a neat little ""cool, more Harry Potter!"" but not even half as good as the worst Potter installment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I was a teenager at the time and my dad came home with a copy of the book. My whole family got hooked instantly and every time one of the new books came out, we would all argue over who was going to read the book first. When I went off to college, I bought my own paperback copies so I could read them over and over while in the dorms and when the later books came out, I repurchased them all in hardcover because they are books I will re-read and hope my kids will read them as well. I love the books and have read them a number of times each. That being said, when I heard that another Harry Potter book was being released, I initially got very excited but then considered not purchasing it because it's actually the script for the play that recently premiered in London. Curiosity got the best of me and I obviously purchased it.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two is the ""Special Rehearsal Edition Script"" that is based on a story by J.K. Rowling and the playwright is Jack Thorne. The play is broken down into two parts, which are further broken down into two acts in each part. It takes place 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ends when Harry is happily married to Ginny (Weasley) Potter and they have three children together. This ""story"" mostly focuses on Albus Potter, Harry's youngest son, but many of the characters from the Harry Potter books appear in this script as well.

I don't want to give away the plot but I want to say that the entire play is written in a script format so it has stage directions and is written like this:

HARRY: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
ALBUS: XXXXXXX
GINNY: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The format makes it a bit awkward to read since it doesn't read smoothly and a lot of times scenes seem to end abruptly. Some of the scenes are fairly short and overall, this play is a quick read but it obviously doesn't have the same effect as a novel. A lot of times the characters seem flat and bland, without much emotion but it would probably come across a lot differently to see it on stage. I had to get myself into more of a theatrical mode to read this and that helped slightly.

In summary, I feel this script is okay but I actually would've been content to have only read the original seven books because I am happy with how they ended. I think the play will come across better seeing it on the stage but as a book, it isn't too exciting. If you choose to purchase this, know that it is written in a play format so it doesn't have the same feel as the original seven books do. In any case, the hardcover edition fits in nicely with the rest of the books I have and it was interesting to see the characters after nearly two decades.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I really liked the character of Scorpius Malfoy. He was a lovable, sweet nerd.
And now the bad: there really isn’t anything original in this book/play. Everything, every plot point, felt recycled and unoriginal. Perhaps I’m being overly harsh here, but there was nothing truly jaw-dropping amazing and new and fresh here, like there was in every Harry Potter book previously published. The classic characters feel like caricatures of themselves. There also was no true tension in the book, everything was false tension, and it irritated the heck out of me.

Even without descriptive paragraphs, the dialogue was enough to give every character somewhat of a personality. Did some of the characters annoy me? Yes--well, the way that they were portrayed in the play is what annoyed me.

Somewhat of a spoiler(?): What I did like the most were the alternate realities that could have happened. It always interesting how one small change in the past could have a drastic impact on the future. It made me briefly think of Prisoner of Azkaban.

In my mind I am a die hard Harry Potter fan. I have read the books so many times I have seriously lost count. They are my go-to comfort reads, my filler books when I don't know what to read next. I even love the movies. I know there are some fans that can't stand them but I think they catch the spirit of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.
Okay, there's no way to say this well: I did not like Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

harry potter confused shrug dumbledore i give up

However, I still can't tell if it's because of the script format or if the story itself is flawed. Ultimately though, I think it failed to have that same spirit of the HP saga. There was such a sense of wonderment and exploration of the magical world that was so, so enjoyable and immersive, and getting to experience it along with a protagonist who is flawed but inherently likable and good made the emotional investment and pay-off at the end of the series incredibly fulling. Regardless of the story itself I do not think that can be accomplished in a script or stage production. (I've heard nothing but praise for the actual production and I'm sure it is top notch and maybe if I saw it first I would have been swept up in it and not minded that this story comparatively fell short.)

Okay this next part gets a little spoiler-y so proceed with caution.

The most disappointing part of the story to me had to be the fact that they revisited the same conflict of the series. Here was an opportunity to explore the characters of the original story and their children and their lives post the Battle of Hogwarts. Instead the plot attempts to do that while trying to have a finale that mirrors the finale that took seven books to build up to and an extremely complex plot to establish. Regardless of how good the writing, acting, scene design and characters are it's going to fall flat and it did. The fourth act was so frustrating because it was much faster paced than the rest of the play and it was trying to shove all of the elements in this one act to have this epic battle at the end and left so many plot holes. Convenient prophecy is convenient, convenient time-turner IS REALLY REALLY CONVENIENT AND TOTALLY UNEXPLAINED-

*Hem-hem* Anyway...the point being there were too many things trying to be shoved into this one story to make it clean. There were so many plot holes! One of the cool things about the original books is that there are very little as far as plot holes and certainly no major ones and then there's this story...

I will say Albus and Scorpius were cute and Ginny and Harry were still good together. Ron and Hermione were adorable, even though Ron was essentially a stripped down version of the movie characterization and just served as a way to highlight and balance Hermione's character.

I've chosen to treat this story the way we treat Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Yes it exist, it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't Indiana Jones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I'm a stupidly and crazily obsessed Harry Potter fan. The sheer amount of useless facts about a fictional world that reside in my head make most people in my life shake their heads in sheer disappointment. So you can imagine how excited I was to get my hands on this new story.

Then of course I started reading it. At first I was enchanted by the little tidbits included from the actual books. Little things the beloved characters would say or do was so wonderful. And then all hell broke loose with Albus entering Hogwarts and becoming friends with *spoiler*.

Of course just after that is when the whole thing started a downward spiral that made me want to roll my eyes and sigh at the predictability of every single twist, turn, and plot point. There were several times I wanted to simply throw it across the room in boredom and rage for such critical acclaim of a mediocre plot.

I spent 3/4 of the entire book alternating between rolling my eyes and forcing myself to turn the page. And of course silently commentating in my head with utter sarcasm. The newer characters were terrible, the old characters did not live up to their beloved status, and all relationships between characters were completely two dimensional.

Ultimately it was a little Mary-Sue, extremely predictable, and sad to add into the canonical universe of Harry Potter.

As a matter of fact, if Mrs. Rowling's name hadn't been on the front cover and I was given a copy of this to read, I would have said that it was a very average piece of fan fiction in a sea of fan fiction.

Not going to apologize and I wish she had done better in keeping with her previous works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_77?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=77&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Not bad but not great. A bit dull. But has a great character in Scorpius Malfoy.","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2019","The Cursed Child, as this book is commonly known is a play that first opened in London on July 30, 2016.  Honestly, I bought the book when it came out but put off reading it and then the reviews came out and they weren't good and people I talked to said they hate it so I kept it on my bookshelf and never read it.  But my daughter wants to read it and the book is found in the adult non-fiction section of the library so I must read it before she can.  The only reason it's in the adult section is that the young adult section doesn't have a non-fiction section.

The story opens right where Deathly Hollows ends with Harry Potter and Lilly and Ron and Hermione putting their children on the train to Hogwarts.  It's Albus Severus's first year and he's worried about being placed in Slytherin but Harry reassures him that the hat takes his choice into consideration.  When they get on the train Rose, Ron and Hermione's child tells Albus that they have their choice of friends and must be careful who they make friends with and that these will be the friends they will have for life. In a compartment by himself is Scorpius Malfoy looking pretty forlorn when the two of them arrive he cheers up and offers his candy. Albus is touched but Rose believes he is trying to buy his friendship and then do bad things to him.  Besides there are rumors about his mother that she took a Time-Turner and went back in time and had sex with Voldemort and Scorpius is his child since she and Draco couldn't have children of their own.  But Albus doesn't care about that and refuses to move on with Rose and sits with Scorpius and makes a friend.

When it's time for the Sorting Hat, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and becomes a pariah.  He also can't seem to do anything right like ride a broom or do a potion or a spell.  He feels less and less like his father's child every day and more and more like a failure.  Scorpius is having similar problems though he is great at school work everyone believes he is Voldemort's son and they hate him.  Albus is his only friend.  Meanwhile, as time passes, Harry and Albus grow farther apart as the two fail to understand the other.

The Ministry of which Harry is the Head of Law Enforcement and Hermione is the Minister, find a Time-Turner capable of going back years.  This could be the Time-Turner used by Draco's wife if indeed she used one or it could be a dangerous artifact.  Harry receives a visit from Cedric Diggory's father who wants him to use the Time-Turner that it is rumored that the Ministry has to bring back Cedric.  Albus is listening in and meets Diggory's niece Delphi who takes care of him at St. Mungo's Hospital for the Sick, Old, or Insane.  The next day Harry tries to give Albus the blanket that is all Harry has left of his past. It's something that means a great deal to him and he's trying to reach out to his son with this gift but Albus doesn't like it and says that he wishes Harry wasn't his dad and Harry says he wishes Albus wasn't his son.  He doesn't mean it and wishes he could take it back the second the words leave his mouth, but his son gets so under his skin.

Albus and Scorpius leave the Hogwarts train and head to St. Mungo's and talk to Diggory and Delphi about bringing Cedric back.  It just so happens that Delphi has some Polyjuice potion brewed up for them to use to sneak into the Ministry of Magic. Albus decides to be Ron while Scorpius is Harry and Delphi is Hermione.  They sneak into her office with some difficulty and have to figure out where the Time-Turner is.  But Scorpius figures out where it is and they leave with it.

The first time Albus and Scorpius use it Cedric still doesn't live but Hermione and Ron don't marry and Hermione is a teacher not Minster of Magic.  The second time they use it is when things go seriously wrong afterward.  Can things be fixed?  And who exactly is the cursed child? Is it Scorpius for being Voldemort's child or is it Albus for being Harry Potter's kid?  Will Harry and Albus ever get the chance to repair their relationship?  Will Harry ever figure out how to fix it? Will Draco and Harry become friends finally?

This book isn't as horrible as I thought it would be. That's not to say it was great.  It lacked a sense of dangerous adventure to it that the Harry Potter books had in them.  I will say that I loved the character of Scorpius. He was delightful in his love of reading and homework and his quest to get Rose to fall in love with him.  He may have been in Slytherin but he was a sweet and caring boy.  If it hadn't been for family tradition maybe he would have been in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.  Rose is a bit of a bitch and reminds you of Draco Malfoy with her speech of who you should be talking with on the first train ride to Hogwarts.  Of course, Scorpius reminds you of Hermione.  Which leaves Albus to remind you of Ron or Neville.  Overall I think Rowling wrote this in response to those fans who kept decrying that she saved Buckbeak but not the Potters.  That it was more important to save a Hyppogriff than to save James and Lilly.  This play shows that the farther back in time you go the more things you can screw up.  This book was okay and did have some good characters in it.  I give it three and a half stars out of five stars.

The fact that it's written in play-format doesn't bother me. What I'm disappointed by, though, is that Rowling would not have written the things that are said in this script.
There's no backstory. There's no depth in characters. There's no subtle hints, or hints at all. It ignores any obstacles they had to go through when Harry is at Hogwarts. It's as if the writers couldn't make up their minds on how people actually develop and end up in different places than you'd expect 30 years ago, when they're 11.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_75?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=75&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Please follow me on my blog :) Review originally posted on <a href=""http://www.vellumvoyages.com"">Vellum Voyages</a>

Well ummmmmmmmmmmm.....ok...so this is the eighth HP book.............

I'm just going to list my thoughts & chat about them, as its probably the easiest way to analyze my  feelings. I'm still wondering how to feel because I feel an odd yearning for more & NEED more from what I just put down.

1) J.K Rowling did not write this particular book - The original story is hers, the magic is there, you can see glimpses of her for sure but the language: that British wit that she brandishes throughout all her books is not there. The characters don't feel like who I knew seven books ago. Is this deliberate? To demonstrate that the characters have changed with the modern times? To demonstrate that we are dealing with a whole new generation, therefore the lingo changes too? Parents pick up things from their kids? It feels like modern lingo has been thrown in randomly here and there - I can't tell if its accidental/on purposes/for script reasons. Personally, I didn't like it because I didn't feel like they were the characters I knew. I didn't feel like they were the authentic characters I loved so much. It was distracting & detracting.

2) If this story was written as a novel it would have been MUCH MUCH better - The script format is confusing at the beginning & hard to get into, but once you get used to it, the reading experience improves slightly. There are momentous things that happen reduced to mere sentences because of the format. I miss the explanations, the little details, the clues & HER WRITING! J.K WRITES MAGIC WITH MAGICAL WORDS. Her writing is glorious to read, she brings her characters to life with it! Why is that taken away??!!!
For example: how do Severus & Albus know how to make polyjuice potion? They make it and use it. No further explanation.....Isn't this potion in the restricted section in the library? I know they have wizarding parents but still.....I want explanations! I want to know how they get the ingredients for it. I want to know which cupboard they raided from which corner of Hogwarts. I want every single detail of their lives dammit.

3) Why did J.K do it this way? - I do not understand why she chose to do this in a play format. Initially, when I first heard about it, I thought OMG that's awesome!Then I thought again. There will be millions of fans who will never get to see this play & therefore miss out on the drama of the script. Why do that to a fanbase so large? I'm sure, she has her reasons but I still don't understand it. She has touched so many people and yet she is only giving them a chance to glimpse a part of book number eight.

4) Is the story good? - Yes, it is sorta....I was annoyed when I first started reading it because I felt like all the favourite/momentous parts of all seven books have been taken and combined on to make the eighth book revolve around them. The ending sums up the created story. That's good right?

5) The friendship between Albus/Scorpius & Harry/Draco - Cute new generation, loved Scorpius and Albus as friends. The writing sorta hinted at a gay relationship? But then they have girl crushes. So yeah.
Harry & Draco felt too happy happy joy joy after all that animosity in seven books. When did that happen? Was it explained? No.

6) Did I want to read about the new generation? - It's their parents I love. Their adventures. Their triumphs. Their losses. Oh the losses.....The new generation is nice & if this is the path the author wanted to take to tell the story, fine. But I wanted a well-written combination of both. Not this.

Be warned. This is an emotional journey. Emotional because this is another HP book and that's momentous in itself but also due to the disappointing format & lack of detailed story. I would recommend this cautiously. If your expecting to revist your favourite characters, yes they are there, albeit a shell of their original selves but it's still them in some ways. They took me back in fleeting glimpses & that's all I got. So I'm still yearning for more. If you are expecting something like the rest of the series, you won't find it in this book. Read it because your a fan & then take the good and bad as it comes. That's what I'm trying to do. 3.5 helms because it made me think, made me emotional & because it took me back briefly to that magical world I love so much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It was a solid story that gives us a peek into the future of adult Harry Potter, his friends and the Wizarding World but ultimately lacks any real suspense or surprises and features a ""villain"" that doesn't measure up and seems to come out of nowhere from a character development perspective.  Without giving away spoilers, I did enjoy the narrative hook that uses a standard sci-fi/fantasy concept to give us some moments that were very touching in the context of the the bigger Harry Potter story.

I think I will just say it takes place after the 7th book in the series and is more fan fiction than anything. This was okay but not great.  It was just something to extend the Harry Potter world that felt unnecessary to me.

Those who say this reads like fanfiction are correct; that is pretty much what it is.  That is not to say fanfiction is bad, and this was okay.  It just didn’t have the magic of the earlier books.  This is also written as a play (which I knew going in) and I am not a huge fan of reading stories in play form.

The majority of the story focuses around the next generation of boys (Harry's son Albus, and Draco's son) and their daddy issues.  That right there is pretty much the story.  Voldemort comes back into play in a sense and this kind of made me groan.  I am not a huge fan of the “returning of an already vanquished evil” theme.

Overall this was a quick read and it was okay, but I didn't love it.  My ten year old son, who is absolutely obsessed with Harry Potter right now, did really enjoy this book.  So, this book may work better for younger readers who just want a bit more Harry Potter in their lives.  I was fairly disappointed and would have been better off if I had never read this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It just didn't feel like Harry Potter!  After reading and rereading and re-rereading all 7 books over and over, you get a good sense of Harry's personality.  This just felt “off”.  I'm sure part of it was that I was sooo excited about a new HP book to read, so maybe I had unrealistic expectations.

The plot was a bit unsteady, some parts dragged while others seemed to not have enough detail.  I liked some of the other characters better than Albus, who's supposed to be the hero.  The time travel twist was good, but not enough to really carry the story.

When speaking to Dumbledore's portrait Harry kept calling him Dumbledore rather than Professor.  The kids addressed all the adults by their first names, Snape calls Ron and Hermione by their first names, and Draco and Harry using each other's first name.  The names really threw it off for me.

Another thing out of character is when Harry is alone with Delphi he says he has never fought alone.  Didn't Harry fight Voldemort alone?  Harry has fought alone most of the time.  It's almost like Harry has lost his nerve.

I would love for JK Rowling to write a book based on this new character Delphi.

PROS:
1. SPOILER: There was a tie-in to the events of ‘Goblet of Fire’, which is my favourite of the books.
2. SPOILER: There was a time travel aspect to the story which I’m a sucker for.
3. There were patches of good dialogue. A few lines even had me laughing out loud.
4. Some scenes did resonate emotionally for me, but, CON, I think it was more nostalgia from the books, rather than due to what was actually happening at the time.
5. SPOILER: I enjoyed the friendship between Albus and Scorpius.
6. SPOILER: I enjoyed any scene between Harry and Draco.
7. There was one scene where Albus was smart, and that was the best part of the entire play.
8. It probably would be a lot better performed live on stage. Well let’s hope so anyway!

CONS:
1. In a script where you rely heavily on dialogue to convey everything, most of the dialogue was poor.
2. New characters were one-dimensional.
3. Fourteen year-olds spoke and acted a lot younger, for the most part anyway.
4. It seems, Harry, Ron, and especially Hermione, have undergone personality transplants somewhere between ages eighteen and forty. I think Centaur, Bane, put it best in Act Two when he says to Harry, “You’ve grown older, but not wiser.” I couldn’t have put it better myself! Although, small PRO, they were more true to themselves in the last half of the play.
5. There wasn’t a single scary moment throughout – not even when characters were in actual physical danger!
6. The plot was predictable. I guessed the villain early on.
7. SPOILER for the Third Scene, Act One: When Albus is sorted into Slytherin and quickly befriends Scorpius everyone acts like it’s the worst crisis ever. Now given everything Harry knew by the end of book seven, and given that he gave Albus Snape’s middle name, I would’ve thought he would’ve raised his kids to be more tolerant and accepting.
8. Also, James, Lily, and Rose, were just plain old mean. I can’t condone this!
9. This might be a bit nitpicky, but Scorpius used a lot of modern day slang, more so than any other character. Considering how Draco felt about Muggles, this seems odd to me.

End of rant!","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","27 people found this helpful"

I own every movie, every book (including all the mini books released – Quidditch through the Ages, Tales of Beedle the Bard, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and I have read each of the 7 books so many times that I could probably tell you the entire story without cracking a single book.  So naturally when I hear that almost 10 years after the last book was released that a new book would be published, I could not wait to read it – to be honest I am surprised it took me so long to get my hands on it.  I think subconsciously I was worried I was building up the excitement too much and that this play would fail me.  I read this over Thanksgiving weekend, but I haven't posted about it because I've needed this time to reflect.
This book is actually a play, in case you hadn't heard.  I wasn't a fan of reading plays when I was in school, so I make it a habit not to read them in my adulthood; but hey – I had to make an exception for this one.  I knew ahead of time and prepared myself; that I can deal with.  I think my biggest (and really only?) issue with this book is that I can't really tell that it was a J.K. Rowling/Harry Potter book.  The writing styles were different, the characters were different & acted differently and it just didn't have the same kind of flow that I came to expect of a Harry Potter book.  Don't get me wrong – this is a good play, IF you go into with the mindset that it is NOT a Harry Potter book.  It seemed kind of rushed, and I actually was able to read it in a 12ish hour period.  Even on my 7th or 8th read of Sorcerer's Stone it takes me longer than that to thoroughly enjoy.
This is, unfortunately, probably the lowest rating I have given a book and it breaks my heart that it is a Potter book that is receiving such a low star rating.  But I cannot in good conscience give it a higher rating.  Maybe if it wasn't an official HP book?  Or maybe even if J.K. Rowling's name wasn't on it?  I'm giving this 3 stars because, if I separate it from my previous love for HP, it is a good play.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

That said, the story is rather a mess. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS. The dialogue is not at the level of Rowling's; many elements seem to have been inserted into the plot in order to satisfy fans who want to see familiar characters in particular contexts; extensive teasing of a love affair between two boys goes nowhere and should either have been used or removed; numerous characters become purely functional and somewhat interchangeable role-players in the plot, particularly Hermione, Ginny, and even Harry. Draco Malfoy is unrecognizable. The villain is both predictable and, to a great degree, underutilized.

I can understand that JK Rowling probably just wants to write Cormoran Strike right now, but frankly she should have made sure this was written at a higher standard. I think of the complexity of character development in, say, The Casual Vacancy, which is like a short version of a Tolstoy novel, and wonder why she couldn't get this play to be a little better about it. Plays can have great characterization and great style. No doubt I will read this again after a while and find more nuances than in my quick rush-through, but I wish still it had been better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","4 people found this helpful"

If there's one thing I've always wanted that someone else had it was her imagination. Unfortunately, in The Cursed Child it seems to be non-existent. So I'm wondering if she didn't want to revisit Harry, then perhaps it would have been best to have left it at the seven books instead of handing over the reins to someone else.

Like the rest of you, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I'd pre-ordered it with a couple of other books but it wouldn't be here till Sept and I was NOT going to wait that long to return to the world of Harry Potter. So out I went first thing the morning of it's release and picked it up. Four hours later my giddiness had turned to confused wonder. What had I just read?

I had no problem with it being a script. I thought it kind of exciting to get Harry's story in a different medium. I've done theater in the past and a good script is like a good book; you can easily get lost in the story. Sadly I think this is where The Cursed Child suffers the most. Sure the plot is not the best (ok not great at all given the soooo many different ways this could have gone) but as Harry Potter fans we're used to characters with complex feelings and histories. We've already been opened up to the immense wonder of that world and it's people. As a script this limits us to what we see and hear. We aren't allowed the into the heads of the characters and as a result complex inner turmoil and character development we get in the books are lost. Instead emotions are verbalized which in turn, all too often in this case, leads to some cheesy dialog. I might have been able to forgive some of the character inconsistencies if this had been in novel form and motivations were better fleshed out.

As it were I was left wondering what had happened to the characters we all knew and loved. Harry was...well not at all like Harry. If this book did one thing for me it made me look back on my life (I'm 39 so thought I could relate to Harry at this point) and all it's trials and tribulations (and there have been some big ones) and wonder how much I've changed. I can honestly say nothing to the degree of Harry. I get it, he's had a traumatizing past, he's now a family man with a stressful job but this is like Harry in a midlife crisis. As one reviewer stated all Harry wanted was a family. It was the most important thing to him next to friendship yet here he was acting like a petulant child. I related far more to younger Harry than this one. Your experiences shape you as a human but with good people surrounding him I would have thought Harry would have grown up to be a better adjusted adult. And as for Harry's excuse he didn't have a father...well I know some pretty amazing fathers that didn't have ones of their own. Besides he seemed to do just fine with James and Lily.

As for Albus I spent my time wishing I could put him in a time out. The rest of the characters seemed to be nothing more than shells of their former selves. Harry described Ginny as bold, fierce and funny but I got nothing of this from her, Ron was not Ron and Hermoine...well there were moments I could see her and moments not so much (ie. turning into a warrior in the future-wow that one threw me for a loop). Voldemort having a child with Bellatrix and Cedric turning into a death eater as a result of embarrassment were also a stretch for me.

So why 3 stars (and this is a low 3)? Mostly because it's Harry Potter. I was at least able to return to that world whether I liked it or not (Hey we can't always change our own world to how we want so I'll have to accept Harry's as it is as well-or just make up a new story in my head). It wasn't all bad. There were a couple of good quotes and of course it was nice to see some of the old characters again. I think my favorite part of the script was the involvement of Draco. I enjoyed getting a glimpse into his life and seeing how he changed. I also enjoyed Scorpius and how he turned out so differently from his family. In fact, I would have loved to have seen more of their story. I think they would have made a more compelling plot.

Oh well. As it is I can say I read it. Will it be going on my keeper shelf? Nope, I'm pretty sure my seven other books would set a banishing charm on it. For now I'll keep my sight on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (making sure not to set my hopes too high).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_157?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=157&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

While it does not have the depth of JKR's normal books, it does have the same feel. I felt it would be better for you to have you and your HP friends each act out a part because it does not have the same growth or exploration of characters as the books. While it is a good topic to explore on, the play format, like the movies, does not have the time for you to really get to know the new characters as reading the books would allowed you to. It is interesting to see Harry and the gang grown up and how the next generation is, but it feels that the situation is plot driven to allow certain events to happen as oppose to real character motives. I hope JRK allows the HP universe to expand to allow other writers the freedom carry on the story or to delve into other aspects of the universe (hopefully the movie ""Strange Beasts.."" will allow that).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Words from some tv show or long ago movie.

The direction is very precise yet I can't help but think that the writers had a specific tone for characters speaking certain lines that are lost on the reader. Plus the set, if this were done as close to concept as possible, feels like it's too cinematic for the stage. Special effects up the wazoo and whatnot.

Finally, the magic wasn't even part of the story. It seemed put on. Or forced on. The brilliance of the Harry Potter series lies in that fantastic world of magic and how wondrous and commonplace it was. That universe just became fleshed out as the years wore on. It's not here.

But, as stories go, it's simple and straightforward. A story of parents and children and how we can never have the parents we want, or the children that we thought we could shape. That space is where the conflict really lay. And it's pretty typical.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

And you know how sometimes Disney makes a sequel to those okay movies with completely different voices, thereby making the sequel to the okay movie even less okay than the first?
That's how I feel about 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.' It is a pale comparison to JK Rowling's original 7 Harry Potter books. It feels somehow plastic, not nearly as real.
When I read the 7 original books, I could not put them down. Was absolutely, incredibly enthralled by them. They remain my favorite books even now. When I read this newest one, my brain would connect that I was reading something and then it would go ""Oh, yeah, that Harry Potter book."" It wasn't something I NEEDED to ick right back up.
So, ya, if you're a hardcore Potterhead, than you should read a copy.

The Cursed Child is a quick, fun read that will satiate your potter-cravings but don't go in with too much expectations. I was very generous to give this a three star review. Had it been a fully fleshed out novel, it would've probably been different. It's a play so obviously we can't expect the writer's imagination to translate into production (there are some things magic can't do in the rigid frames of reality). It's great seeing the trio again but the play was written by another writer so the dialogues are obviously less Rowling-esque, not to mention the characters themselves. The characters don't feel like Rowling's creation, but more like some writer's interpretation of them. Hermione's character is the way I imagined she would be, tough strong, independent, and witty. Other than her, I couldn't really relate to Harry and Ron again. I wasn't sure if it was because of the nineteen year gap between Deathly Hallow and this book and their personalities just changed or if they were rewritten. I couldn't find a hint of their usual charm in the book. Besides that, I loved Scorpio and Albus! Scorpio stood out the most to me-- funny, pure, smart, reserved, and a closet adventurer! There's a lot of potential for this boy. His story is unique and interesting but all too familiar. This boy will have a book with his name on it for the next generation of potter heads.

Overall, there are numerous plot holes in the story but if you don't think too much, if you're only here solely for your love for the series, then you should be fine. I appreciated the fan service that was scattered throughout the book (and there are plenty to that will get you cheering and teary from nostalgia) but it could've been written better.. Three stars is the best I can do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_149?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=149&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

Meh.","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2016","Ho-hum. Most books, you either like them or you don’t. For this one, I can’t decide.

Maybe it’s because I give JK Rowling a bonus for being brilliant and she could copy the phone book and I’d still read it happily. Or maybe it’s because I missed these characters so much that I would have given anything to see them again, so to speak, even at the cost of having to read a mediocre book.

Because that’s really what it is, a mediocre book. My first gripe is that you can tell it wasn’t written like JK Rowling’s other books, aside from the fact it’s a play and not a novel. Meaning it doesn’t seem to be written entirely by her. For this book you feel she sort of glanced over the summary and gave her nod of approval, then left the premises. There are too many inconsistencies – it’s called the Ministry OF Magic, not FOR Magic in her other books, and certain charms like “Flipendo” have never appeared in her other works, just the computer games. I found that sloppy – like an unwelcome intrusion. As if people who’d only ever seen the movie but not read the books were suddenly in charge.

Spoiler alert: The time turner makes another appearance. As does gillyweed and polyjuice potion. Lots and lots of polyjuice potion. I never found it all that convincing to begin with, thinking that of all the magic available, going that way is the most cumbersome avenue, and it stays that way here. Personally, I would have loved another walk through Diagon Alley but there was no room for that. Actually, the entire first few years of Hogwarts are compressed into just a few pages, which is hard to swallow given the typically slow start and diving right into the moment for all the other books.

The story is basically all about Harry’s youngest son Albus who struggles as a teenager, as teenagers are prone to do, feeling oppressed by the fame of his father and not fitting into the family mold. His best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, Draco’s son, around whom suspicions swirl that he is Voldermort’s son. A fantastic plot of time travel and messing up the past ensues - It’s plausible I guess, but I found the plot too forced –bringing back certain elements of the previous series that had been particularly popular. There were parts that I enjoyed – the glimpses of Ron and Hermione as a married couple, for instance, another appearance of Prof. Umbridge, or hearing a little bit more of Dumbledore’s wisdom – but the main shortcoming for me was Harry. He just didn’t seem to be using his head like he used to.

If you love these characters and have been dying to hold this not-really-a-sequel in your hands, you’re going to buy it and read it, regardless what anyone here says. But if you really want to treat yourself to some good fresh writing, read JK Rowling’s (aka Robert Galbraith) Cormoran Strike detective series. THAT is a story you won’t be able to put down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","3 people found this helpful"

(Possible Spoiler warning)","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","Look, I ADORE Harry Potter. I wanted to love this new story. It isn't awful, but it does NOT feel like JKR's work. It doesn't feel like a genuine HP story. This feels like fanfic. The original characters (Hermione, Ron, Harry, Ginny, Draco, McGonagall, and even Amos Diggory) don't feel genuine. They don't feel anything like the ""real"" characters. This feels, sadly, just like any series where someone different takes over and starts writing. Everyone is there, everyone we love, but they're different - like they've had a lobotomy or something. I don't think it was necessary to turn Ron into a bumbling idiot. I find it highly unlikely that Hermione and Ron would ever raise a child like Rose. Then again, Rose plays nearly NO PART in all this. Albus is a jerk, Scorpius is an incredibly kind person, and I wanted more of him than just humorous one liners.

There's little in the way of character development. They tried to cram 5 years worth of content into a short stage production. If this was always the premise of the story, it was a poor idea to force it into a stage production. Nothing about this translates well. I'm sure the staging is beautifully done in person, but the story itself all feels rushed, and half baked. It truly, and deeply pains me to say this - but I just didn't like it. It really feels like Thorne's fanfic, not JKR's work. I've read much BETTER Fanfic than this. After all these years, I really thought I would love anything JKR wrote in the HP universe. I was very, very wrong. I will still place it in my collection, it is still a part of the HP world, and as a whole, I treasure that world. This just isn't my cup of tea.

***Update - I re-read this. I still don't love it. But I don't hate it either. I am considering that possibly the nuances of character development and dialogue require the actors (who I hear are amazing) to really bring them to life. I still dislike the plot.

Unfortunately I must say it was a bit of a letdown. The story read like a fanfic piece and the original characters did not really seem to speak to me in the way they did in the original books. The new characters also seemed sort of flat, and I didn't really feel attached to them in the same way as the original characters. This could be attributed to the fact that this is a screenplay and not a book, but I've read other screenplays that simply felt more involved. I really hate to give this story three stars, but the whole thing felt like a forced and unnecessary addition to the canon universe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

All in all, I would buy it again because I adore the original 8. And, I commend Ms. Rowling's courage in releasing this.

It's a must-read simply because it is the last official book in the series. I don't even mind the script format. You get the background from the stage cues.

I was extremely disappointed in the characters' roles. I could understand to an extent Harry Potter having trouble communicating with his teenage son Albus Dumbledore. I cannot understand how Harry Potter is grappling to find common ground with his son after 15 years. Harry was an outcast at Hogwarts at times, so I find it hard to believe Harry could not relate to how Albus is feeling. I think Harry in this book is almost unlikeable. He always got in shenanigans when he was at Hogwarts and valued his friendship with Ron and Hermione, so how could he possibly think an appropriate punishment is to separate Albus from his one friend!?! Also, Ginny has a very depressingly passive role as his wife. Ron is still an enjoyable character, and he lightens the book with his antics.

The time traveling aspect seems like a crutch. In a way, the writers do not have to come up with a new storyline. The book ends with nothing new really happening. It's repetitious and an easy way to use that world without changing it. It's also reminiscent of Prisoner of Azkaban where they use a time traveler to travel back in time and have to make sure not to run into themselves. However, time traveling is a main plotline in this book.

I really love the character Scorpius Malfoy. His humor and relationship with Albus makes the book worth reading. Albus being a Slytherin was really exciting, but the writers never really used it to their advantage. You never see the Slytherin house from a different angle or gain a new appreciation for that house. Also, I wish there was more of a conclusion to whether Albus and Scorpius end up enjoying Hogwarts more or if anything changed for them there.

All in all, read it but don't expect it to be on the same level as the other 7 books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I'm constantly going back every couple of months and reading the books. That said, that whole magical and insanely creative world Rowling has created with Harry Potter is not in this book. Being as it is a screenplay, there are none of the small, yet magically delightful details that she put into her other potter novels. There is no character depth, or thoughts that make you partial to any new characters. Although the there is enough of the world we love to make this screenplay enjoyable for us desperate potter fans who love anything about hogwarts and the magic world, it doesn't satisfy the craving of anyone waiting to dive back into hogwarts and relive some magic with the old gang.

But even with that aside, I felt most of characters fell fairly flat (partly because of that and other parts due to their actions) and some things that happened in the plot just came out of nowhere, but not like a twist or surprise but more like ""well, that was random."" The alternate time dimensions were cool to see how things could've been, and at least those made sense, as to how it could have happened. Certain characters from the original series I felt did not stay true to their originals but 19+ years have passed and also parenthood, but there were some things that they did that, even with that, I still don't think they would've done or at least done differently. I did finish this book though, it was interesting enough to see how it would end.

Soon I realized that it was not actually written by her nor was it a novel but a play. This helped me to set up my expectations to start reading. From the beginning, the play requires a lot of background knowledge in the history of Harry Potter. I found myself pausing to reflect on pieces from previous books or the movies to help me place myself in the story and create the imagery. If you have not previous read any of the books, I think it might be hard to follow and invest in the same way as any of the other books.  It was a wonderful play but as a book it was not up to the “Rowling Harry Potter” name.
The book was enjoyable and a quick read. I met some new characters, revisited Hogwarts and got to image the life of Ginny and Harry as parents.  With any play, they develop a lot of the personality of characters through the act which was hard to develop in this book. I was able to piece together a sense of Albus and Scorpius but the character of Rose was very limited. In previous Harry Potter books, I felt like I deeply understood the characters and could relate to them in various situations. Because of the limited writing in this story, it was hard to know them deeper than a surface level.  The adventure was also not as detailed as true Rowling fashion. While the authors wrote about each time travel back and the ripple effect they had created, I never felt the same buildup of the adventure. I was also left confused about this daughter and am planning to go back and re-read the Harry Potter books to see where this could have actually been placed!
This book only took a few hours to read and while it wasn’t all I expected it to be, it was a great trip back to Hogwarts and with some familiar characters and settings.  I have read mixed reviews on this book and I personally believe that if you are a Harry Potter fan, it’s a fun adventure to remind you of the magic as long as you go in expecting it as a play and not as one of Rowling’s detailed novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

 ** spoiler alert ** While it was nice to continue the Harry Potter story... I think I need to see it on stage instead of read it.

It was capturing, it was a cool idea. Obviously JK Rowling didn't write it, she came up with the idea of the story but not the script. The voices of the stronger female characters were not as prevalent. McGonagall was still strong as the Headmistress and her usual stoic yet caring self... but it was missing something. Hermione... wtf happened. Sometimes she was her strong, know it all self. Other times it was like she just took a back seat. Hermione never takes a back seat. Ron was forgettable. It all just happened too fast. I feel ironic saying that since it's two plays that span about 2.5 hours each.

As I said, I just need to see it on stage. If Jo wrote it herself, turned it into a novel, I'd probably like it better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I started to think about it when I finished. I realized that when I reread this play I will enjoy it less. I was so excited to see my old friends again. But they aren't real in the play.  They aren't real to Rowland's true canon. That's not Harry. The playwrights ruined our Harry. They ruined all of them. It was not good enough they all deserve better. However, I liked how Draco was able to bring himself from the darkness. He was my favorite part of this play. Read if you have to. If things play out I will see if someday on Broadway.

The book, not so much","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","Finished ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" last night. Keep in mind, this is a script and thus only contains dialogue and stage directions. As a theater major, my mind can fill in the blanks. A lot of folks won't be able to and the intricate world drawing that Rowling did in the novels is missing. That said, I'd LOVE to see the production. I can't imagine how some of those effects work. I LOVED the new characters of Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. They were totally believable and fun. The old friends of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco were not nearly as well done. I thought they strayed from the characters that Rowling drew. Of course, a lot would depend on an actor's interpretation of that character and their chemistry with the other characters. The premise of the story was fun and believable within that world. However, the dialogue kind of had a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" vibe to it. My take on it? I'm fussed that I spent $30 on the book. Wait for the paperback, borrow it from a friend or the library or buy it in a used book store.

A lot of the rules that JKR had created for her world just were willy-nilly set aside with some sort of glib attempt at explanation. It just didn't satisfy and part of it reminded me of some fanfiction stories I had rolled my eyes at. There were some redeeming factors, such as the true friendship between characters that would in the previous Potterverse have been destined for hate, seeing some familiar characters step into maturity, and seeing Harry struggle with his legacy.

Where to begin...
Just know, I always have been and always will be an avid Harry Potter lover, supporter, fan. I grew up with the books, went to all the midnight premieres, watched all the movies a million times over, did it all.
At first, I was really reluctant to read it; I was more so nervous than anything because the standard that the original series had set was really high in my mind. But reading it with an open mind, I've come to really like it and appreciate it for what it was. it's own separate thing.

I will admit, there are many flaws; it's not perfect. The plot line near the end was a little predictable, and the twists were surprising in a very corny kind of way. I knew the dynamic was going to be different because they're older, their lives are different, everything is different.

But a big thing that I loved about the original Harry Potter series was there: the development of friendships and relationships, sometimes even between unlikely people. For here, especially between unlikely people. It also gave me the opportunity of getting a glimpse (however small) into their lives after. Bringing all that in, with all of these characters I've loved for all these years, I liked it. Didn't super ""LOVE"" it, or thought it was incredibly amazing. Just...liked it.

Upon reflection, I’ve found that this was also true for me: I always avoided fan-fiction stories based on the second generation of characters because there was no canon that recorded their dimensions from which my imagination could proceed; it felt fraudulent from the first, a misgiving that entirely missed the irony that I write stories based in a universe created by another writer.

Luckily a Clean Sweep has swept away all such concerns from my head and burnished the mantle previously occupied by what we, and Rowling presumably, thought was the last instalment of the franchise. In its place stands the brand-new eighth book, a script adaptation of a play of the same name, 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'. When Rowling hinted in a 2010 interview with Oprah that an eighth book was possible, I dared not believe her. But here it is.

'Cursed Child' picks up the story 19 years later from King’s Cross, where Harry and his wife Ginny drop off their wizards- and witch-in-training, Albus Severus Potter, James Potter and Lily Potter. Aboard the Hogwarts Express Albus meets the spawn of his father’s childhood enemy, Scorpius Malfoy, who feels just as trapped by his family legacy as Albus does, and they become fast friends. Together they travel far and wide in both time and space to right the wrongs of the past and liberate themselves from it.

Without spoiling it (at least not too much), here are my owl droppings about the story.

Ginny is a broomstick wife—or rather a Shooting Star

Any first-year would tell you that the Shooting Star is the lowliest of brooms (but wouldn’t go as far as to scoff at one, for many of them would have never been on a broom before, so any would do). It’s standard issue and clocks a measly speed. Ginny’s performance as a character is not much better: she disappears into the wall even as she shares the scene with Harry and vaguely resurfaces to mutter empty platitudes of encouragement to him. She’s a husk of the fiery redhead we saw in 'Half-Blood Prince'—even in 'Chamber of Secrets' when she was distracted and possessed for most of the book. It’s a faded rendering that does not do the character justice. But as this is the first script I have ever read, perhaps I’m missing the point that this format might necessitate such sacrifices.

Her brother, Ron, is equally diminished in character, getting very little  productive stage time. James and Lily appear in three scenes each at most in the entire story. But beyond that the colour returns. If you thought Harry was irascible and too quick to act, Albus is in a Quidditch league of his own; Scorpius barely has enough time to pull away from a hug (yes, Scorpius is strangely hug-happy in this story, which stirred my suspicion that something little more than a friendship was afoot here) before Albus grabs him by the arm and plunges them into another rabbit hole.

Harry has a rich character arch. As he contorts himself with guilt and fatherly concern before his son, who keeps testing him, we are reminded of the evolving mental state of a young boy who had to grow up very fast in a foreign world and in the cross hairs of a tenacious terrorist. We enjoy a refreshing insight into what goes through Harry’s head as he tries to build a firm foundation of trust and affection with his youngest. The same tension takes place between Draco and Scorpius, though, of course, to a diminished extent (who has time for all these finicky emotions when there is an empire to build?)

At last we get the measure of our favourite wizards and witches, and, as judges do with the strata of precedents in common law, we can interpret their actions through all manner of scenarios in our fanfiction stories. Finally the ink from my pen can flow.

Time-Turner as predictable as sands in an hourglass

As you may have surmised from the blaring hint above, the Time-Turner features heavily in the story, which was rather predictable. But if I could give myself a pass on this cliché as a fanfic writer, surely I could deign to extend the same courtesy to the mother of the 'Harry Potter' universe. So I move that by the order of the Wizengamot, the charges against her are dismissed. Although, naturally stories that involve time travel tend to have some pretty convenient bends, so be prepared to roll your eyes here and there.

The deferred dreams of fathers

Just as the death of Rowling’s mother leaps from every page in the previous seven books, so does her complicated relationship with her father in every page of 'Cursed Child'. Albus and Harry size each other up, and Draco at first has just enough time to give his only child a once-over, which is much more than Voldemort would ever care to give… I myself have spent a mere 14 minutes in the presence of my biological father, which I suspect is why I cherish the bond between Harry and Dumbledore so deeply that it, too, bleeds on every page of my fanfiction efforts. Gees—how many of us have daddy issues?

An unexceptionable to good story

The story has a few twists and turns, most of which you see coming a mile away. But I think we should keep in mind that it is meant to be shown, not read, so the obvious must scream and the subtle at least harrumph. I lapped up everything that told us something about the second-generation characters, who include Ron and Hermione’s children, Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley (What, you thought Hermione would offer to drop her family name? Have you read her?) Its most compelling feature and through line is the relationship between Albus and Harry.

'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' is a worthy if lukewarm addition to the magical universe. Now that we’ve broken the drought of entertainment that began after the release of the eighth and final movie, we can finally hope for a 'Harry Potter' television show that would Reducto! all traces of 'Wizards of Waverly Place' from the face of the Earth, retired as it is. If Merlin has any mercy.

Synopsis:

The story, play, begins where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ended (in its epilogue). 19 years have passed, and a new generation of Hogwarts students make their way to the Hogwarts Express. This time, it is Harry and Ginny's middle child, Albus Severus, that begins his first year.

When Albus arrives at Hogwarts, he finds everyone is excited about his arrival. Another Potter, another child of the famous Harry Potter. He soon finds that living under the shadow of his famous dad is more pressure than he can handle. He grows to resent his dad, prove that he wasn't the hero everyone thinks, and maybe right a wrong that Harry committed so many years ago. Will doing so prove that he is worthy to be the child of the famous Harry Potter?

Along the way, Albus makes a couple of friends. The unlikely pairing of Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's old nemesis Draco, is frowned upon by all. And, the mysterious Delphi. Who is she? Is she the answer to all of Albus's questions?

Follow Albus and Scorpius as they try to navigate the sons of fathers with heavy pasts and make names for themselves. Join Harry and the old gang as they try to grapple with ominous happenings while figuring out what the children are up to. The whole world hangs in the balance.

(I understand that isn't the greatest of synopses, but I'm trying to keep out spoilers while not copying the synopsis from amazon or others. :) )

What I liked:

I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I loved the books, enjoyed the movies (they could have done better, but they were still enjoyable). To get the chance to join my favorite characters in another adventure was irresistible.

I love the plot - original and engaging. It is a slow start, but once we start in on the action, it keeps you turning pages to find out what happens next.

I would love to see this performed on the state - it's an element that cannot be ignored for this story. Obviously the book is the script and so it does not have the brilliant prose of Rowling's originals, but it is engrossing.

It is a story that will have you smiling at the end for the sheer pleasure of one more adventure.

What I didn't like:

The character development was the weakest point, I believe, of the whole story. I suppose they sacrificed a lot for the time constraints of a play, but I think they could have spent more effort on each character. Many were two dimensional. The whole of the story focuses on Albus, Scorpius, Harry, and Draco. Even the four of them lacked in development, though they fared far better than anyone else in the story. Sometimes, you're left to wonder where others are - surely they are around, though there is nary a mention save in passing.

And I absolutely hate how Ron is portrayed. Sorry, he's not always had the best of it in the original books, either, but here he is just pathetic.

The plot is predictable. Of course, so were many of the books. That isn't its weakest point, but one I think could have done with a boost of a good twist.

The climax wasn't entirely satisfying. It felt rushed and too clean/abrupt when there was so much build for something far more spectacular. It gave me a ""well, yeah, but..."" feeling when it was all said and done.

Conclusion

To see the actual production would probably make up for many of the short falls I find in here - the wows would probably make me forget the lack of characters.

I loved going on a new adventure, and learning about new characters - and even delving into thoughts and motivations of old ones.

I just wish it wasn't so rushed. Maybe that is the main problem with the whole of it - it was rushed. It reads much like a fan fiction piece that someone decided to put on the stage. It's good, but not great.

My biggest disappointment: That this will be the last that JK Rowling will delve into Harry's life. Not the last into the wizarding world, but into Harry's life.

Farewell, Harry. It has been a pleasure.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The Pottercast podcast once started a verbal story series that focused on the kids and what they did at school 19 years later, including Scorpius. I hate to admit it but that one captured the characters better I think.  I am a huge Potter fan. I’m a huge Rowling fan.  I enjoyed the screen play for what it was, but I found some of the characterizations a little odd. Specifically, Harry and Ginny were odd to me.  Ginny is pissed because Albus is struggling to relate to people and Harry isn’t connecting with him properly to help Albus because Harry’s always at work. Well for one, why can’t GINNY connect with Albus? She’s his mother after all, she can reach out to him too. Secondly, the kids are at school for most of the year and only home for a few months in the summer. Harry, who only ever wanted to have a family, wouldn’t make sure to spend quality time with his kids when they were home for the holidays? That doesn’t sound like the Harry we’ve known.  Part of that I actually found interesting though, Harry struggling to connect with Albus was interesting in some ways because Harry isn’t perfect and you see how human he is in the story. However, there are parts where it’s just over the top. Him spending a specific day with a blanket each year is just freaking weird. The Trolley Lady on the Hogwarts Train was super weird. Who really shines in this book is Scorpius and Draco. Draco is more adult than Harry in a lot of ways and Scorpius is just a really great kid who would never have been put in Slytherin because he’s a sweet kid all around. He’s the real star of the show for me in this book. Scorpius is who saves the day really in so many ways. In fact, I’m not entirely sure he’s not the cursed child in some ways.  Oh, and I’m glad I’m not the only one who totally thought Albus and Scorpius had a thing for each other. I’m glad a few other reviewers mentioned it too. I was sad they didn’t end up being together, it would have made more sense and would have been pretty cute.

So as a fan, yes I think you should give it a try. It is different. It’s not what you expect. It is interesting to see them all as adults and to be excited about who turns out to be Minister of Magic. I enjoyed it but I did find some of the aspects of it odd.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As many of you, I've been a HP fan for as long as I can remember, reading the books multiple times a year throughout elementary until high school. In fact, if memory serves me well, I was a fifth grader when I first became a fan and now I'm in grad school. Harry Potter is not just another series I've enjoyed, it's an inherent part of my childhood and teenage years that I cherish to this day.

Nevertheless, I've always been a critical fan of Rowling and I've criticized her whenever I think it was fit, instead of glorifying every decision she makes, regardless of how awesome of a writer she is. Now, I tried to judge this book—script—for what it is, a play, not a novel, and that's fine.

SPOILER LAND!

::::What I wish was different::::

1)  I was not expecting much character development or vivid descriptions because of the format and I can live with that. However, what makes me feel uneasy is that, the more I kept reading, the more it felt like a fan fiction rather than a genuine HP story. I don't know how much involved Rowling was in this work (from what I hear, she wasn't very much involved in the writing aspect), but it is difficult not to see this work as a glorified fan fiction at times. Harry is sort of a jerk at times, Ron is more laid back than ever, Hermione seems rather clumsy at times—it is just odd. Like it doesn’t fit quite well entirely with the foundation set by the books. I understand the concept of change. I'm not the same person I used to be when I was 17 years old, so I don't expect the famous trio, for instance, to be just as they were now that they are 40. But at the same time, as we change there is continuation and, at times, I think that continuation is lost in the play. I can see how Harry could be a jerk with Albus—not having a true parental figure himself and just being frustrated with his kid, but the fact that he even threatened McGonagall (someone who stood up for him at critical times in the past) seems way out of character. Ron, likewise, was sooo laid back and almost completely irrelevant with his commentaries; it just doesn’t truly resembles him, given that although he was kind of laid back in the books, he took seriously what was serious. The same goes with Hermione, if anything, I’d expected her to be even more cautious and clever than ever. This is the girl who devised a system of secrecy around the D.A. and even a contingency plan in case of having a snitch. But somehow, she didn’t put much thought on hiding an overpowered magical object capable of changing the whole world.

2) The sole fact that Voldemort had a daughter seems odd and counter intuitive. As many have pointed out, Voldemort was a very unilateral character, basically obsessed with power and power alone and the idea of him reproducing himself—between the 6th and the 7th book, while his mind was completely occupied in waging a war—just seems odd for that kind of character. What was the point of  such idea when you think you’re going to live forever and specially when you’re so self-centered you want the whole world for yourself? And of course, is not like Bellatrix ever had a belly—but then again you can make everything look less “Deux Ex Machina”  with magic.

3) The fact that Scorpius and Albus are best friends, is cool, I even like the idea, but they don't act like typical best friends. I mean, take a look at Harry and Ron. Throughout 7 novels they did not express their affection to each other as Albus and Scorpius did in just one book (a script, nonetheless). That is just odd. C.S. Lewis, reflecting on the idea of friendship noted in “The Four Loves” that “Lovers are always talking to one another about their love; Friends hardly ever about their Friendship. Lovers are normally face to face, absorbed in each other; Friends, side by side, absorbed in some common interest.” It is for that reason their friendship looks unrealistic. What I loved about the friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione was not the expression of affection and loyalty, but its demonstration. They didn’t spend much time expressing their feelings about their friendship, they showed it day in and day out. That’s what made me think as a boy: “Wow! I want friends like that! I want to be that kind of friend!” But the friendship of Albus and Scorpius is cheesy, overly-expressed and quite unrealistic.

4) The whole plot revolving around this glorified Time Turner was odd as well. In most readers' minds this aspect is probably the very thing that makes everyone think this is poorly written fan fiction. It's like the whole plot was a magical Back To The Future—and that's not a good thing. I mean, after all, Rowling did spent quite a bit of time trying to tight the potential plot hole the very existence of a Time Turner could create—and now there are in existence more powerful Time Turners capable of changing the past and the future in matters of seconds. Even if all of such glorified Time Turners are destroyed, who’s going to stop a skillful wizard from figuring out how to make another?  In my opinion, the very possibility of creating one of these Time Turners breaks the balance Rowling sought to create between what is possible and what is not possible to do with magic. In addition, I think that the events that they revisited in the past are going to be stained by this joke, Now Scorpius and Albus are going to be in the back of our heads when we revisit the TWT and, quite frankly, it just ruined it.

5 )The ABSOLUTE WORST of all, in my opinion, was the Trolley Witch. Oh, my goodness! This—above everything else—is what makes the script look like (bad) fan fiction. To start with, it looks that somehow this witch has been working at the Hogwarts Express since 1830, making her over 200—maybe 300—years old. This witch is even older than Dumbledore ever was. It just defies explanation. On top of that, she is able to turn Pumpkin Pasties into grenades and transfigure her hands into claws. Oh, and she also doesn’t even remember her name, yet is able to do presumably complex spells. While in the HP universe such things sound certainly plausible, it doesn’t stop from sounding ridiculous.  Again, it just sounds like bad fan fiction.

::::What I loved:::

1) Snape. In my own judgement, Snape looked true to his character for the most part, even adjusting for some changes in personalities due to time and life experiences. His battle against the dementors was memorable and, not only that, I loved the idea that somewhere—somehow, Snape was able to know what happened in the future, how Harry forgave him and started to admire him and how he honored him by naming one of his children after him. That was moving.

2) Scorpius. Albus who? Albus, is a walking cliché of a character. He is the typical son living under the shadow of his father that has something to prove to the world. Nothing out of the ordinary. But Scorpius, in a sense, is not only the real hero of the story, he is his own persona, he is funny, witty and quite different from his father. Without him, I don’t think I would have enjoyed this script almost at all.

All in all, I still gave it 3 stars because the script was fun to read (for the most part)  and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Nevertheless, I am disappointed about the overall plot line, how the characters were portrayed and how unnecessary and childish some aspects of it were. Sadly, I cannot help but to conclude that this script did not meet the expectations I had.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

That sets up unfair and unreasonable expectations.

This is, of course, a stage play, which Rowling only had a hand in creating. As a result, it's missing a lot of the world building and internal dialogue she includes in her novels, making the whole thing seem thin when compared to the previous seven stories.

Taken, not as a novel, but as a script it's OK. There's definite heart there and Albus and Scorpius in particular are charming characters. But Harry Potter stories rely a great deal on things that don't translate great to the stage and not at all to the script book. The recent news that Warner Brothers was looking at turning this into up to three movies is, for once, actually pretty good news, as the spectacle that doesn't translate well as a script will work perfectly on the screen and the additional time will hopefully flesh out some of the parts that feel rather thin as-is.

This is worth reading for Harry Potter fans, but they should go in expecting something much less than previous Potter works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I was left so disappointed...and confused.

I knew going in that this was going to read like a screen play so I wasn't distracted by the formatting. What left me scratching my head was the continual mischaracterization of Harry. Who was this character? Also, I got so distracted by the contrasts of the characters during the parts of the story which were dictated by the time turner.

Yes, I thought that plot line was cliche but it truly didn't bother me. I just with it had been built upon more substanciously.

I thought Scorpio's character was fantastic...he was probably my favorite part of this entire book.

I would consider this a must-read for Harry Potter fans but go in knowing it's not nearly as magical and books 1-7. I also caught at least three editing mistakes/grammatical errors which still stands out to me.

* BE CAREFUL! POSSIBLE SPOILERS! AND ID ON'T KNOW HOW TO MARK IT AS SUCH! *

* I'll admit I'm a little mad that the writers and publisher let us all believe that JK Rowling was the one who wrote the script when, in fact, it was the other two guys. That's deceptive and not very fair to fans, especially when they know fans will pay literally anything to get more of Harry Potter even if they can't necessarily afford it.

* Even though I do love it because, well, Harry Potter, I cannot bring myself to accept this script as canon. I've been having a bit of a hard time coming up with a way to make it okay with my brain that yes, I've read it… No, I won't forget it… How can I live knowing that this play exists and that these books exist, supposedly in the same universe, without actually accepting that this IS the continuation of Harry Potter's story. THIS IS what was going on throughout the fourth book. And then it finally hit me.

* I'm a big fan of The Princess Diaries, both the books and the movies. However, they are drastically different. I accept the books as canon. The movies, as delightful as they are, are nowhere near as good as the books. And Mia doesn't end up with Michael in the second movie. No. That's just wrong.

* Then I remembered that in the books, Mia actually mentions the movies! She calls them ""the movies based on my life."" She's also disappointed that she doesn't end up with Michael in the second one, even though she claims that the new guy is a total babe. Which he is. That got me thinking. I can trick my brain into believing that this play is kind of a play ""based on the story of Harry Potter's kid's life."" Very loosely, that is. In fact, a fictionalized version of it altogether.

* I know this sounds a bit crazy, but this is important to me. I can imagine that, in my canon world, Harry and Ginny and the rest of the gang are fully aware of this play's existence. It's a play that they enjoy. I'm certain that it's absolutely stunning on stage. But, much like the Princess Diaries movies, it is hardly based on reality. There are no Time Turners. There is no secret Dark Lord love child. Harry did not go back in time to watch the events of October 31, 1981. Come on. That's just straight out of some kind of fan fiction. But it is an emotional idea.

* So, that's how I am reconciling the existence of both the books and the play. The books are canon. The play is not, but it is loosely based on the story of Harry Potter and Albus Potter's lives.

* I do accept that Albus and Scorpius are best friends, however, and that Scorpius is an adorable little nerd. I can totally see that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I suppose I was hoping it would be an entirely new story, not one that used previous books and experiences over and over again to keep a story alive. Not to mention, I extremely disliked that it quickly skimmed over Albus' first several school years. If I were to have read this without the expectations of a Harry Potter quality story, I probably would have liked this more. Again it is a screen play, so it reads much different than a novel and surprisingly that part very minimally bothered me. But due to this, it wasn't nearly as descriptive as I would have wished. I honestly only gave it 3 stars because I was happy to read more stories about Harry Potter and his gang.

The story itself was interesting, however I will echo others who have said that it seemed more to be a FanFiction. The story itself was interesting but it seemed to jump around almost too quickly.

Nothing completely special, you can see where the story is heading early in the second act, but you will muster through because you are a fan. It is a bit confusing to read, I don't know it may just be because I am reading it on my kindle, but having the lines listed out by name and the constant jumping around makes your head spin. I had an open mind coming into this and of course there are many things I would have liked to change, but with a shrug of the shoulders I will add it to my HP collection and probably read it again and again just to get a better grasp of what is going on.

Piper","Realistic Expectations","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","If you're expecting an authentic continuation of the beloved Harry Potter series, then turn back now. If you're properly prepared to read a script of a play that includes some of our childhood heroes, then by all means: read on. All along JK Rowling and the makers of The Cursed Child have been upfront and honest about what this story is, but unfortunately some of us cannot help but hope for an eighth installment of our favorite story. I do believe that this story contains less character development and magic than the Harry Potter series - but how can it not when we are not reading a narrative, but only learning about these characters through the words and minimal stage direction? The first part of the story read similar to a bad fanfiction project - forced plot lines, cheesy recollections and inside jokes, and a painful attempt to bring us back into the wizarding world. The character relationships were awkward and inauthentic and the overall mood of the story was very immature and not well thought out. Around halfway through the book however, we begin to understand the characters and their motives. We begin to understand the complex plot points that felt so forced, and we are forced to relive some of the trauma from the series.

These alternate realities give us insight into the significance of each character in the series, and how the slightest change in history could forever change the wizarding world. The plot, very focused on two small specific aspects of the intricate Harry Potter series (time turners and Cedric Diggory - of all things to zero in on...) suddenly becomes relatable and more familiar to those of us who followed Harry, Ron, and Hermione into unfathomable situations throughout their Hogwarts years.

All in all, I believe the script leaves out so much character development, the complex emotions, and the feeling of familiarity - but is well worth the read for those of us too poor to see the play. Yes, it may be disappointing to some of us, but we can never expect to truly relive those midnight releases of the next HP book, or that feeling of knowing the fate of Dumbledore before the rest of our peers because we stayed up reading the night the book came out. If you approach The Cursed Child with realistic expectations, I believe you will enjoy yourself. Any glimpse into the wizarding world is well worth a couple hours of my life, no matter what.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_129?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=129&reviewerType=all_reviews","14 people found this helpful"

I'm honestly not quite sure how to digest this one. Let me preface by saying that I was fortunate enough to see the Cursed Child play on London's West End last week and it was magnificent! Sam Clemmett, Alex Price, and particularly Anthony Boyle did a fantastic job portraying Albus, Draco, and Scorpius respectively. If you get the chance to see the play, you will not regret it. The actors wonderfully bring what is an otherwise bland script to life and make it one of the more enjoyable and engaging live productions that I've seen.

With that said- make no mistake about it, this play was quite clearly not written by JK Rowling or even in the tone that she set throughout the seven books. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (especially Ron!) almost seemed foreign to me. Ron's character is written in such a pathetic manner that it almost makes it unbelievable that someone like Hermione would be married to him. The play leaves you thinking that he has become a man of little to no substance as his character is inserted minimally and primarily as a source of comic relief.

[MAJOR SPOILER ALERT] Aside from the integrity of the characters being compromised, the play also leaves some glaring plot holes; the most prominent one being Bellatrix Lestrange's pregnancy. The playwrights expect us to accept that Bellatrix Lestrange gave birth to Voldemort's child at Malfoy Manor prior to the Battle of Hogwarts. Wouldn't Rowling have left some hint of Lestrange's pregnancy in Book 7? If the child was born before the Battle of Hogwarts, wouldn't Voldemort have found some way to use the child to his advantage; especially because at this point he knew Harry was on a quest to destroy his horcruxes? Wouldn't Voldemort have done something desperate with the child knowing almost certainly there was no way that Harry Potter could ever destroy a baby, and thus never destroy him? I don't know-- it just seems too far out from the original story line for me. Voldemort's character in the books was desperate for immortality and power. Based on what we know of him, all signs point to the idea that he would have used that child in an act of desperation or selfishness to quench his thirst for these two things. Marring what was a marvelously crafted fiction series with baby drama seemed rather unnecessary to me. There are so many different directions they could have gone with for a sequel and this ""who's your daddy"" option was a little too soap opera-y for me.

Although the premise of the play was Albus' struggles with living in his father's shadow and how that affected their relationship, there were too many inconsistencies throughout the play that distracted from this theme. However, Scorpius both on stage and in text was a delight! I would say that his character was probably one of the highlights of the play. Overall, I thought it was a weak follow-up to an epic series. If you read and accept it as something that was intended for the stage and somewhat disconnect yourself from the 7 books, then it's OK. As someone that has been enamored with the HP series since it was first released, I found the play to be underdeveloped and somewhat disappointing. It is definitely worth seeing on stage, but reading it as a standalone makes me wish Rowling would release an eighth book to clear up some of the inconsistencies and reestablish the magical world that we all grew up with and loved. Of course I would recommend reading it, but do so with an open mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

I feel like I don't have as extreme an opinion about this as many people do though.

I love the idea of Harry's son and Draco's son being best friends (or maybe even something more, if you ship them, as I do). I even like the idea of Harry and Draco getting over some of their animosity toward each other, of Harry's son not being what everyone expected, and of the father-son issues between Harry and Albus and between Draco and Scorpius.

However, As much as I liked the ideas of all the things above, I don't think they were executed well. Everything was so dramatic and mushy. It was basically just, ""Look at how wonderful and caring and misunderstood Snape and Draco actually are!"" and heart-to-heart moments between Harry and Draco, and a bunch of unrealistic, forced conversations about friendship and father-son issues. No 11-year-old immediately tells another 11-year-old they've just met that they have father-son issues. Is this just how plays are? Since there isn't information about emotions, the characters just speak all their innermost thoughts and feeling and struggles, even when it's not believable to do so? Also, everything Scorpius said sounded like a Tumblr post (e.g. ""Oh my, that’s her. Wow. Squeak. My geekness is a-quivering."" <-- that's an actual quote), which was funny but, again, not believable. So yeah, the dialogue was unrealistic, and the characters from the original series seemed out-of-character sometimes.

Also, the time travel aspect didn't work for me. It seemed like it had a lot of plot holes and logic flaws, as time travel usually does in stories. The story itself had some issues too. Like, how did Albus and Scorpius manage to get to the blanket that was wrapped around baby Harry, in order to put the potion stuff on it to send the message to older Harry, without Lily or James noticing them?

Then there was the whole, well, twist, let's call it. Honestly, I don't really feel much either way about it. [Hidden spoiler can be found in my review on my blog or Goodreads.]

I can tell you what I do have strong feelings about though: Scorpius and Rose. Why is that even a thing? She was such a jerk to him.

Anyway, I'm not really sure what to think about this overall. It was good to see some nice Slytherins for once, the friendship was sweet, and it was fun being back in the Harry Potter world, but this play did not reach its potential for me. Maybe actually seeing it how it's meant to be seen would've made it more enjoyable? I don't know, but if Rowling were ever to rewrite this as an actual book (which I don't imagine she will, but a girl can dream), I'd give it a try.

However, the second play amounts to so much fan fiction. There's no suspense (there's only one new character, so we know who the ""mysterious"" secret antagonist must be, and we know the stars must all survive). And this lack of new character points to a larger problem — by restricting this universe-threatening challenge to characters we already know, using magic and artifacts we already know, this play serves to make the Harry Potter universe seem smaller. The resolution of the plot relies on plot devices rather than arising from the characters, which I suppose is fine for children but will children really want to read a two-part script?

My kids have seen the stage play and liked the magic, so perhaps avoid reading the script and just see the show when it inevitably arrives in a theater near you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It had just enough forward momentum to keep me moving along and the child characters were actually fun to read. Really, it was just a nice excuse to jump into the Harry Potter world again.

But were things that just didn't work. The basic plot was, well, basic. To add to that, the characterization of Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Draco could best be described as spotty. Overall, they feel wrong.

I wish there were stage directions here. It would help with things like building tension or understanding relationships a little better. Body language goes a long way.

All said the book just needed to be an actual novel with drawn out concepts and emotions to match the more serious tone of the later Harry Potter books. They tried, but it just doesn't translate on the page.

*********Spoiler Town Complaints**********

Sure, bring in a descendant of Voldemort. There's potential for an interesting story there where SHE perceives herself as a victim. Maybe we could get some dramatic tension by actually reducing her age (s***, there's so many hints dropped about a kid conceived through time travel there's no reason it couldn't happen) and allowing her to have conflicting emotions and a budding affection for Albus.

So Hermione never noticed that someone broke into her office huh? She didn't see the books strewn everywhere? She didn't have a conversation with her husband about seeing him during the day when he was kissing her and telling her he wanted a baby (which was someone else with polyjuice potion)? Okay.

As much as it hurts, there's too much fan service here. Don't even get me started about Voldemort Day.

Why is Ron suddenly the creepy drunk uncle? And drunk on his wedding day? Come on.

I was also excited that they released the script in book form.  Now I knew going in this was going to be a play script, and not a book.  And after reading it, I think the play would be slightly better as it would have acting and special effects.  But then great acting and special effects can't make up for the writing.

-- SPOILERS --

This clearly wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, and you can tell based on the characters.  But before I begin, I would like to focus on some of the good things from this story.  I really enjoyed the father / son moments between Albus and Harry.  This was in my opinion, one of the few redeeming things from the story.  But the best character by far goes to Scorpius Malfoy.  This character made the story palatable.

So lets talk about some of the things that didn't sit well.  The first was the plot, which was pretty much a weak time traveling plot.  One that would make even the Doctor cringe.  Using a time turner, Albus and Scorpius pretty much mess up time and have to go back and fix it.  This gives us a great opportunity to visit all the old Harry Potter characters, in alternate time lines, but who wants to?  While the nostalgia was nice, I wanted to hear a story about new characters, not just name drop some of the familiar ones.

But even then, I could look away at some of the cheesey parts, and enjoy the few scraps of good story telling, up until Delphi.  Delphi, it turns out, has been manipulating the boys the whole time in order to get them to change time and bring back Lord Voldemort.  Which in itself, is fine, until it is revealed that Delphi is the daughter of Bellatrix and Voldemort and was born just before the Battle of Hogwarts.  This is where it got all George Lucasy for me, and the cheese factor exceeded even levels that I could tolerate.  Ignoring how wrong this idea is, and unlikely, as well as the timing of it (Bellatrix fought pretty well in the Battle of Hogwarts for someone who just had a baby).  I just cannot accept this as cannon.  Delphi could have been a death eater, maybe even the descendant of a famous follower, etc.  But to make her the daughter of Bellatrix and Voldemort was too much for me.  They might as well have had her build C3PO while she was at it.

So for me I am going to take the Scorpius character as being awesome, and the fact Harry is not a perfect father, and flush the rest.  Time to put the book down, and count the days (100) until Fantastic Beasts hits the movie theaters, and hope that J.K. Rowling helped write the movie, will make up for this cursed book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_162?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=162&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I'll review the version first:

One thing you must understand when it comes to HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD: not only is this a play with minimal stage directions, but author J.K. Rowling is NOT the playwright. In fact, Rowling’s writing TEAM only provides the “original story” – the actual play is co-written by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne.

So, is it worth reading?

Ultimately, I’d say yes, though I don't feel this format is wise for those who are either first-time readers or even casual Potter fans. In fact – though I’ve read every book several times and was as captivated on each reading as I was on the first – there were times reading the play I questioned whether I was enjoying myself...that is, to the level of the previous Potter entries.

Now that I’m finished, however, I can truly say I’m glad I read it. And here’s the best news: if the play lives up to the potential displayed here in this text, it is going to be an AMAZING and yes, MAGICAL experience to see it live. (And, from what I’ve read about its opening night in the N.Y. Times, it is.)

I am not really getting into the story here: other reviews and the blurbs above are doing that already. I WILL make the point that pretty much ALL the main players get some stage time, though some are very brief. Even though the play is essentially about the children of Harry and Ginny Potter, and Draco and Astoria Malfoy, its clever plot allows for the presence of the likes of Dumbledore, Snape, and even He Who Must Not Be Named – and all in a very organic, faithful and well-handled manner, without any pandering or falseness.

But here is my recommendation: if you are someone who truly MUST read this play because you can’t stand waiting, then do so. However, if you’re someone who can wait for the version that is rumored to be coming out -- one WITH full stage directions, then do so. Though neither version will be written by Rowling, the stage directions should get across to the reader more of the charm and sophistication of what is taking place on stage. Sure, the dialogue is important, but seeing a story about Potter and Hogwarts WITHOUT getting a sense of the magic that is happening alongside it is sacrilege, and in this version that is what you get. For example, while you find out that a certain incantation is taking place, there is no DEPICTION of it… and without that, you don’t have the spectacle of a Rowling play.

As to the positives and negatives of the play itself, regardless of format, I thought that the play must be extremely strong to see...though the real tension for me took a while to develop. It seemed strange for me to see Harry be such an inadequate father when it came to rearing and reassuring Albus. I was surprised that Harry found it so difficult to say the simple words thaat would have helped so much, and it was equally odd to to see Ginny be so reluctant to guide him in the right direction. But no one is perfect, and the Potter series is predicated upon the concept that a hero isn't someone who does everything right ALL the time. One learns, often by his (or her) mistakes.

What really bothered me was how certain key players were held to a minimum. Ron has a really small part here -- MUCH smaller than I expected, and he was more of a buffoon than a real player of consequence. In his stead, Draco Malfoy really earned a

But I was really surprised by what a poor showing Dumbledore had, and particularly how harsh Harry was when it came to his old mentor. I don't want to give up too much here, but I felt this figure was really treated poorly by this particular outing.

Yet I will say that I thought this was one of the few Time Travel plots that was reasonably easy to digest without being simplistic. Time travel plots can be EXTREMELY thorny and complex, and in fact can really stretch credibility, but not here. As stated earlier, the events of this plot made sense and the conundrums time travel engender seemed logical. In doing so, the resulting conclusion of that part of the plot was extremely powerful and moving.

While this play is being regarded as a VERY powerful stage presentation, I am grading it on its readability, and that’s why I’m giving this version a 3. If the rumored ""upgrade"" comes out I will give it a higher grade if it delivers … like I am guessing it will.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I didn’t exactly hate it either because it was missing that Harry Potter magic that we’ve all come to expect from this series.

It was fun to delve into a play, something I hadn’t done in quite awhile, which also made it a quick read. I enjoyed visualizing what the scenes would look like on the stage — and according to the stage directions, the play must be spectacular.

But I did find the story lacking. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the whole story was missing a major villain, someone the reader could really hate, someone along the lines of Voldemort. There was an antagonist, but they just didn’t seem evil enough for the Harry Potter universe.
The other strange thing was the lack of magic.

Also, I wasn’t thrilled with the relationship between Harry and his son. It just felt wrong. Harry knew what it was like not to fit in and be bullied and yet he seemed to have very little sympathy for his own son.

My favourite characters in the story, by far, is Draco Malfoy, followed closely by Ron Weasley.

Overall, I did enjoy The Cursed Child, but found it lacking at the same time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The very limited descriptions I could deal with, because J.K. did such a great job creating this world that I could SEE everything in my mind without it being described to me. The big problem being all of the characters are unlike themselves. I understand people change in 20 years, but not to the point that they're completely different people. Also, I don't think Cedric was a big enough character to base a whole book around. If you want to reverse time to save someone, why not go for Dumbledore or Harry's godfather? Ya know, someone important. The pace and content is way off, too. It starts off great, dives into bad territory, gets better, gets into worse territory, gets better and ends on a very average not.

One can tell the J.K. Rowling did not write this: Much of her crafting is absent, although the playwright tries his best. We have a story of a conflict between Harry and his 14-year old son, Albus, who finds that the weight of his father's fame isn't easy to live with, and their estrangement leads to desperate measures resulting in an adventure for Albus with an unexpected friend, and dire consequences.

This is a bit tough to rate, as I find the current collective rating of 3.4 stars to be pretty accurate. I'd round it up to 3.5, and since Amazon doesn't do half stars...well, here we are. I was originally going to give this 4 stars, but there's a major problem with this play, one that undermines certain scenes and character establishment from the novels. While doing my best to not spoil, we have a character whose stated mother was portrayed as childless in the novels, and it was a very important part of her character that she had never been a mother.

That's just one of the major plot holes that exist in this script. Another is never being shown the turn of the character Albus and friend were trying to save. The other problem with it, of course, is that it is a script, not a novel. As a result, it is barren of the characterization and details that a novel fills in, that in a play or a film is filled by the visual and auditory aspects. I can see that the play itself is likely better.

It's still interesting to go back into this world. But as scripts go, this one is lacking as a dry read, depending too much on the visual spectacle of the actual play to make a fully satisfying read as a script.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It is a short read at only 320 pages.

We start of at the Epilogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows wherein Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione are sending off their daughter and sons to Hogwarts at Platform Nine and Three Quarters. Albus Severus Potter, Harry and Ginny’s second child is scared that he will be sorted out to Slytherin. James Potter, the eldest, keeps on teasing him. Harry assures him that he is named after two headmasters of Hogwarts and being sorted to Slytherin is not a bad thing.

Albus and Rose, Hermione and Ron’s daughter, boarded the Hogwarts Express and entered a cabin occupied by one boy - Scorpius Malfoy. Rose didn’t like being in a cabin with Scorpius given that he is a Malfoy and there are rumors going around about him being the son of Voldemort but Albus felt comfortable with Scorpius so he stayed with him in the cabin and that started their friendship.

When they arrived at Hogwarts, Rose was the first one sorted and she got sorted to Gryffindor - no surprises about that. Albus, however, got sorted to Slytherin and everyone, even the Sorting Hat, got confused and silent about it.

Over the course of the year, Albus was bullied at school for not being like his father. He wasn’t able to get into the broom the first time he tried, he is not a Gryffindor and he is not excelling in any of his classes. He became timid and had just one friend - Scorpius.

The play fast forwarded to their second year in Hogwarts then to their third year and to their fourth year. Harry is Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Hermione is the Minister for Magic while Ron manages the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. There is no appearance from the other Weasleys. Harry and Albus’ relationship turned for the worst and the last night before Albus’ fourth year, Harry and Albus fought. On that same night, Albus also overheard Harry talking to Amos Diggory who is begging for Harry to use the illegal time turner he got from a wizard he caught to bring back Cedric Diggory. Harry didn’t agree to Amos’ pleading and Amos’ went back to the hospital with his niece, Delphi Diggory.

Albus went to the Hogwarts Express and was determined to do something about bringing back Cedric to life and he asked Scorpius to go with him. Albus and Scorpius managed to get to the hospital where Amos is staying and they ended up in the “Bring back Cedric to Life"" Quest with Delphi in tow.

That is pretty much the plot point of the play. Traveling back in time trying to save Cedric, learning that when you try to change the past, the future may or WILL end up differently and then trying to repair what you have done by asking for help from other people. There is a part where it is more of a Scorpius show than an Albus show but I kind of enjoyed that part because finally, there is a likable and cute Malfoy in the Harry Potter universe.

I didn’t understand much why Albus and Harry had that conflict. Their conflict is a bit similar to Snape and Harry’s relationship. Maybe it has something to do with Albus being named after Snape. And surprise, surprise, I also can’t fathom who the Cursed Child is. Seriously.

The book is just a transcript of the play with a short description of how the stage looks like and what happens around it and then the conversations between the characters so there are no explanations about why things are happening since you will just be able to read what is being said out loud and none of the thoughts swirling in the characters’ minds. So there’s not a lot of backstory to work on and I felt that some parts needed a backstory like why is there a rumor of Voldemort having a child (unless there was some of that in the previous books that I don’t recall), etc.

Do you know when anime TV series caught up with the manga and they need to put in filler episodes? That is how I felt this book/play is. It doesn’t really change anything in the Harry Potter universe unlike when X-Men Days of Future Past changed the future. I still enjoyed reading it though and I still recommend every Potter fan to read it. However, I can’t believe I am saying this, but maybe it is really time to give Harry Potter’s story a rest and move on to other wizard’s story such as the upcoming movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Harry Potter will forever be in my heart but unless there is a new and logical enemy out there not from Voldemort’s blood line, let’s leave Harry and the gang in peace and just re-read the original books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews","12 people found this helpful"

The Cursed Child, but not quite as much as I hoped to.  I don't want to spoil it for others, so I'll just say that some points convey a strong sense of fanfiction wish-fulfillment.  I enjoyed Scorpius' character, though I don't understand how someone with his personality would come out of Draco Malfoy's home.  I'm torn about the depiction of Rose Granger-Weasley; it's hard to imagine Hermione and Ron producing such a snobby kid, but she is the daughter of two of the major heroes of the last Wizarding War, so perhaps it's not particularly surprising that she feels entitled to be the among the most popular kids at Hogwarts.  I found Albus' character to be a bit troubling.  I don't understand how he gets sorted into his House, unless we are supposed to believe that he was attempting to rebel, even from the first.  Also, the crux of the story is the complicated Albus-Harry relationship, and I think that the script quickly passes over the source(s) of tension, and, as a result, the conflict is under-developed.  I am also disappointed in the lack of any real family connection between the Potters/Weasley-Grangers.  Apparently, James doesn't ever really think about, or look out for, his younger brother, and their relationships with their cousins seems largely non-existent.  I also think Ron is written too much as mere comic relief.  And, like many, I really don't like the Cedric development.
The new characters may come alive on stage; on paper, they seem a bit thin.  Not surprisingly, this is especially problematic for Delphi.
But there are things that I think the play does very well.  Amos Diggory's grief and anger feel very realistic, and I can see how Harry and Draco can find some common ground through their concern for their children.  I also like Ginny's portrayal.  And there is a moment when Albus and Scorpius have a break-though about how they can succeed at their task that is funny but also sad, as it so strongly conveys how isolated and lonely they are (though Scorpius' depiction as a loser is a bit confusing because the play gives the impression that he's a nerd and more like Hermione than Ron or Harry in his study habits).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

The story seemed a bit cheap in a way (if that makes any sense). Anyway, I'm sure if I witnessed it on stage I would have given it a higher rating, but for now it gets 3 stars.

Okay, this was wild. From start to finish. And I am so conflicted about it. On the one hand, I was pretty entertained throughout the whole thing. On the other, I was pretty disappointed/underwhelmed overall.

Let’s start with what I loved about it. Albus and Scorpius’ seriously unsubtle love and devotion to each other. Finally, a Potter/Malfoy love story the fans have been waiting for. Seriously though, I’m ignoring that bit at the end. The premise of the story is so outrageous that it was just so entertaining and I loved a lot of it. I was able to easily feel a connection to Albus, and Scorpius. Even in play form, you can see that they’re struggling trying to find a place for themselves in a school that holds the legacies of both of their fathers. Ron Weasley is still the best in every universe and I have nothing more to add to that.

However, for the most part I found the story predictable and the original characters to be completely out of character from their development in the canon Harry Potter books (because I for sure am not considering this part of canon). First, in no universe would Harry James Potter ever say such terrible things to his own son, or try to control him the way the Dursley’s controlled him. Second, there’s no way that Severus Snape would ever be okay with sharing a name with a Potter. Even if he did, he would never outwardly admit to anyone, let alone his namesake.

I was really disappointed with the story overall in that everything that happened was predictable, which is not ever something I would expect from a Harry Potter story. In general though, I found myself having to remind myself just to read and not think too much about it. Time travel stories sometimes really mess with my head and I start thinking about the complexities and consequences, and things overall that could just not happen even in the magical world if you’re following your own rules.

If nothing else, I got to feel the anticipation and excitement of reading a new Harry Potter story and I’ll always be grateful that I got to feel a little piece of my childhood all over again.

Overall, I’d give it 3 bards.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Quick Summary
Set 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, this play looks at the life of a now 40 year old Harry and how he is handling working for the Ministry and being a father to a son he can't seem to understand.

What I Liked
I will preface this by saying that I don't read plays and I only read this one because I grew up on Harry Potter so I was pretty much obligated to read this, right? Having spent so much time with Harry, Hermione, and Ron it was interesting to see how they were as adults and how they had changed and in many cases hadn't changed. I also liked the idea of certain things being destined, like Ron and Hermione. I loved Scorpius Malfoy! He was funny and goofy and sort of embraced his ""loser"" status. He was lonely but also didn't really care, as long as he had his best friend, Albus Potter. I also strangely liked Draco in this one; he's really grown up since the original books and he's got his life sorted out pretty well. He tragically loses his wife but his love for her is so beautiful and his devotion to his son, Scorpius, is also wonderful. There's a lot of coming to understand Draco's past in this one and learning to forgive the angry, confused boy he was.

What Needed Work
I just couldn't really connect with the story and I'm sure it's being this was just a script. I would love to see the actual play because I'm sure I would like it a lot more. There's just so much that gets left out when all you're reading are character lines and some stage direction. You really lose all the emotion of the story so that made this one hard to relate to. The story also had a lot going on because there was multiple trips through time to change and then try to fix things. Just a lot going on. Again I'm sure I would have liked it more in his actual play form rather than just the script.

What I Didn't Like
I didn't really like Harry (don't hurt me) because he's pretty much a jerk about a lot of things. He's pretty obsessed with work and doesn't really relate to his younger son, Albus's mediocre status at Hogwarts. He's not the best father because he's hardly around and he can't understand why Albus doesn't love Hogwarts and everything associated with it. Harry's pretty self-centered in this one and he says some pretty awful things -- granted he realizes his mistake right away and I'm sure we've all said things we didn't really mean in the heat of the moment. To be perfectly honest, reading this now as an adult I can see how selfish Harry was in the original books. A lot of it comes from having the pressure of saving the world on his shoulders as well as being an act first, think later personality. But this was a little eye opening.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

That's a shocking thing for me to say about anything Harry Potter by JK Rowling. Because both she and her series are historically exquisite and worthy of all the gushing praise we willingly gush.
Her writing (sorry for the cliche) transports me every time; the nuances of her storylines, the flaws and frustrations of her characters, the ultimate triumph of good over evil - all of that typically registers deeply with me.
Not this time. The notion written here (no spoilers) raises thoughtful ""what if"" questions, and the cast presents interesting relationships and conflicts - but it just doesn't ever successfully tap into my own imagination, failing to stick with me during my daily routine, as I've come to expect from Rowling.  To be fair, I haven't read many screenplays, but I don't believe the format detracted from the tale's appeal; I just needed about 300 more pages of tale to be told with the exceptional richness Rowling does so well.
Plays do expect the audience to garner a lot from what is often very sparsely written dialog, I get that.
And I get that Rowling set the bar unusually high with one of the most compelling book series I've ever read.  There's a reason there are 500 million copies in print...
But I also get that this is not that, so I'm left hoping Rowling's got another series growing within her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

The biggest disappointment for me was that I loved the world JK Rowling created and how thoughtful and fleshed out her descriptions were. Since this is a play, I didn't have that world creation, just little action. I can imagine it being good on stage, but she should have adapted this into more of a novel for the book release.

As for the plot, it just felt lazy and uncomplicated. Yes, there is a big twist, but it isn't anything grand or shocking. The old characters turned into the parents we hated as a teenager, and the new characters tried to be like Harry's meddling self, but for no reason other than to comfort an old man.

I will say, however, that it is an easy read and it was nice to see how she sees the magic world after the fall of Voldemort, but the nostalgia was not enough to make me want more.

I'm not saying don't read it. You'll probably enjoy it a little bit like I did, but it'll leave you feeling disappointed.

The 7 Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling are my 7 favorite novels ever written. I remember beginning to read them back when I was in elementary school. I continued reading them throughout grade school, anticipating the release of each book and finally finishing the 7th book some time in early high school. At the end of the 7th book, I was completely content with how the story ended. Then, the movies provided some closure. Life was good.

I was excited to hear of the release of a so called ""8th book"". Despite negative reviews, I ordered it and gave it a go.
I was prepared for the fact that this ""book"" was actually just a script. However, once I began reading it I immediately hated that it was a script. It took a bit to get used to that. What I hated the most was that there was such a lack of detail provided. I had to rely on previous books and movie scenes to help paint a picture of what was going on, as well as understanding the personalities of each character. This book is just straight dialogue, with some minor narrating here and there (which is put in parenthesis and italicized).
The plot was there, but it felt rushed. There is lots of skipping around and less story development. It almost feels like you're reading the sparknotes of the story. So many things were just left out.
Note that this book is about 300 short pages, while some of the other books are 700+ full pages of text.

Overall, I'd say read it but don't expect a whole lot. I am so disappointed in J.K. Rowling for this work. I feel that she did not even write most of it. This really could have been so much more...so much better. But instead its a script. From a play. That none of us will ever go and see. It could have been the 8th Harry Potter book we've all wished would have existed, but it's just a script. Some talking back and forth with somewhat of a plot.

Happy reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling thoroughly contradicts herself with the way she has written the majority of her characters, especially Draco Malfoy who she originally said would never get along with Harry and the gang, but in the play she even goes as far as mentioning that Harry and Draco see each other as friends for the first time.  I love Draco, and I'm glad that he finally gets redemption, but it's weak, rushed, and he's out of character for most of the play.  Other than a lot of the characters being very different from their original selves, the play is completely unoriginal and all over the place.  It seems as if J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne took popular elements from Harry Potter fanfictions and stuffed them all into the play.  In fact, even minor elements seemed to be based off of fan's headcannons rather than original ideas from J.K. herself (I'd give examples, but I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who still wants to read it).  If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan, like myself, I'd still recommend reading it as it is considered cannon, but I know many other fans, including myself, who are refusing to recognize certain aspects as true cannon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I definitely had a fun experience reading it, but a month or so on it doesn't sit with me as being a true ""Eighth HP Story."" First off, it re-uses a lot of story and scenes from previous HP novels as time-travel is a central theme of this story. The characters from the original series seem a bit off in some places - especially Harry himself. Oddly enough, my favorite character was a new one - Scorpius Malfoy - he's hilarious and all-around entertaining!

If you're an HP fanatic like me who's read the books many times, you'll have to read this - but just understand that it's not a novel - and they even take minor liberties with certain dialogue that was in the existing series. 3.5 stars would be my rating if they'd let me do half-stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_167?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=167&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling was not involved in the actual writing process. (She's merely one of three credited authors for the original story idea.) Still, this stageplay sequel just about squeaks by on the charm of its characters, especially the sweet bond between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, and on a reader's undeniable joy at any revisiting of Rowling's Wizarding World. I imagine the weaknesses of the script could also be mitigated somewhat by a talented cast performing the lines, and I'd certainly love to see the production brought to life on stage someday. But as written, it's a pretty flimsy work with an absolutely absurd premise, and it utterly fails to add anything meaningful to our understanding of the Harry Potter story. In the script's own parlance, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a ""spare"" -- an inconsequential add-on that's not awful, but is still nowhere near as exceptional as its fellows.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

This can't have been edited; I didn't notice any such errors in her books, which I loved.

The plot was disjointed - how did Harry know Delphi's name? - and the characters apart from Albus and Scorpius were badly drawn. I couldn't see Ron or Hermione in their adult versions. I did rather love Scorpius though; his dialogue was witty and funny, but the scenes without the boys were awfully flat.

All in all, it was definitely entertaining BUT as it is a script and as it is NOT written by JK Rowling, it is not the Harry Potter we know and love.

I won't get into the details of the plot, but I will say that the storyline was entertaining and it was interesting to see a glimpse into how things may have gone if Voldemort had triumphed. Unfortunately you can't really savor any part of the story for long because it was written without any of the frills and beautiful description from JK Rowling.

Now before you criticize me, I GET that it was a play and that you can really only write what can be seen on stage, but with the previous 7 novels setting the bar so high, this was fairly disappointing in comparison. Some of the other reviews are pretty accurate in saying it reads like a polished fan fiction.

All criticism aside, the story was fun and because it was a script, it was a very quick read. Overall, it was exciting to go to a midnight release party for an HP book again!!

Character behavior and personality are also things that become lost with this story making the whole plot highly unbelievable. They shouldn't have referred to this as the 8th book and should have called it what it is, Harry Potter fan fiction. If you want a book that gives you an alternate look at Harry Potter and the rest of the characters this is a good book to read. If you are looking for something to continue the Harry Potter story line, this isn't it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

It is a quick, but difficult read. The play format makes the flow of the story impossible. The story itself is short. It would've been far greater if the format was not written in a play. I also do not see much of Rowling's hand in this story. I would love to see how the play turned out. I wish, for the money spent, I would've got a bit more.

Without giving out spoilers, the entire plot is centered upon a rather minuscule detail from one of the books. That made me question whether this play was written in a true effort to continue the story, or rather to further profit from the Harry Potter name.

Rating 3 stars because, sure, I love Harry Potter and I did get more character insight and a further sense of closure from this.

This script dreadfully lacked the magic, emotional impact, and overall depth of the famed book series. Quite a disappointment.

All true fans are going to read it anyway...

The screenplay format was annoying and made the book feel even shorter than it was; I finished it after only a couple hours.  There are some rather large plot holes but don't want to get into them here for fear of spoiling.

I still enjoyed going into the Harry Potter world as an adult, that I have loved (as have many before me) for years and years.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It was apparent, that JK was not involved in this story aside from giving her blessing on the play itself.
Zero character development - difficult to do with a play script with time constraints.
The characters we've grown to love and associate with, came across as flat and very one dimensional - almost plebian in their portrayal. There was a distinct lack of vibrancy and camaraderie in their interactions.
I agree with a previous reviewer, it was very much a fan fic read - it's too bad, there was a whole host of storyline left undiscovered, and one hopes that had JK actually written it, the hype and the expectation would have been warranted.
For me, I find that I wish I had simply borrowed it from the library, rather than invested in it. I still prefer books over electronic reading devices, and honestly don't feel that this book is up to the previous bar that JK set with the rest of the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

(I always go check 1 star reviews first).  It was too late to cancel it, so  I decided, with urging from a friend, to read it when it came in.  I read it in about 4 hours or less over a day.  It's a short read.

So, to address a critique I saw in the 1 star reviews:
""Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco characters are completely different."" -
well, I found their characters were essentially muted.  The play and book were too short to flesh out their adult selves, and what little character development there was was devoted to the kids.  There were vague recognizable undertones to the adult's personalities, but, there wasn't enough space or time to treat them.  Draco seemed a bit different, but it was more like they humanized him, making him into a concerned parent ""with a history"".

I did bring the book back, as I didn't think it was something I would reread, again and again, as I did the Harry Potter series.  Some of the 5 star ratings I saw seemed to focus on ""AT LAST, something else to read about Harry Potter"".  If it were fleshed out into a one or two book full treatment, then I would say hurray.  Several people felt it was just a money grab.  Well, hard to say if it was JUST that.  It was for a play, which is limited in scope.

I will say this about the book.  There was a LOT of parent/child estrangement, worry and bonding going on, and some of it was heart string tugging, but, still, dealt with on a superficial level.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

Potter world as a play simply isn't as delightful","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","I wish I could read the original story that this play is based upon.  J.K. Rowling is an incredibly gifted writer, and her novels are truly crafted in a beautiful and thoughtful way.  Though this story has the creative plot twists and turns as well the witty verbal reparte that we've come to expect from Harry Potter fiction,  it's missing all of the rich details-- the sparkle and meat of the thing.  Theater is a different creative medium, perhaps not the best format for imagination rich worlds that shine best in a novel format.  In short,  this story sadly falls a little flat.  I believe JK Rowling could fix it be having another go at it, and I hope she does.  It'd be a shame to end the Potter dynasty on this note.

One more thought- it has come to my attention that JK Rowling may not have written a lot of this.  That makes complete sense, and I'm relieved.  Now.  Please.

Read my FULL review here: [...]

Hmm…I’m honestly not sure how to review this…I will say that a script is only the foundation of a play. The words are important indeed but there is something so drastically changed when one sees a play performed compared to simply reading the words in the script.

Okay so why didn’t I give this book 5 stars and a raving review in all capital letters? Well…because it was just okay. While the writing is spotless as usual the story just couldn’t hold my interest (I think I read three or four books between starting and finishing this script).

Scorpius Malfoy is the best character in the whole play. I am forever a Scorpius fan. Albus Severus Potter, kid with the worst name ever, is an annoying angsty little git for 90% of the play and I just couldn't do it.

I’m not saying every story has to be profound or groundbreaking…but as clever as this story makes itself out to be, it sort of wasn’t. Perhaps it was all over-hyped. Perhaps if I had waited until all the excitement had died down I would have enjoyed it more. I’m not sure. Perhaps if I read it again in a year or two I will absolutely love it. Anything is possible.

Rowling is a very gifted writer and I bet this show would be seriously incredible to see performed live (like seriously, based off some of the loose stage directions in it I bet they have quite a few nifty tricks up their sleeves and the characterization that an actor brings to their role is really the magic that sells it).

OVERALL: I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it. Glad I read it but I could totally have lived without it.

HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD is stage play and a brave continuation of the Harry Potter novel series. An interesting look into the Wizarding World’s future that is best performed, witnessed, and experienced rather than simply read and scrutinized. Entertaining but not heart-pounding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I'm going to break it down into pros and cons without trying to reveal too much.
Pros:
- We get a good dose of nostalgia. In particular, I love that Harry shares the first piece of Wizarding wisdom ever bestowed upon him with his children in Kings Cross station. That's one of many moments I loved.
- We get to see our favorite characters all grown up. Harry grappling with being a parent when he doesn't have parents of his own to model after was very realistic, in my opinion.
- Hermione's job title is nothing less than what I'd expect.
- James Potter is every bit his namesake, and I like it.
- Overall, it was a decent read. I enjoyed it, despite the flaws.

Cons:
- What is this timeline? Trying to imagine it as a story, it's hard to follow. What year are we in? Are we jumping back or forward right now? Attempging to imagine it on stage? Impossible.
- Plot holes everywhere.
- The plot twist? Most unbelievable of it all. Literally, you can't believe it because you know it's bogus.
- SPOILERS HERE. Character interaction is awful. Do we even know these people anymore? Hermione sucks at her job, Harry is disrespectful and inconsiderate to everyone, Ginny's a health freak, and Ron's a... drunk? Not to mention, Ron and Hermione's child doesn't like Harry's? What is that? Rose would stand by Albus, I'm sure of it.
- It does not feel like JK did this. It feels like fan fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I will preface this by saying that I will love Harry Potter, ""Always.""
I wish I could say that I was under the Imperius Curse giving this 3 stars.

If you read the script objectively, not expecting it to be a continuation of the novels, it is more enjoyable. Seeing the play in person would give MUCH more personality to the characters and greatly enhance the magic of each scene.  I suppose I would rather have been able to read the story this way, then not at all.
I have a family member that saw the West End Production and said it was an INCREDIBLE experience - every detail was thought out and it was like real magic. I believe that.

Reading ""Cursed Child"" as a script doesn't have the same feel as reading the novels.
I missed Harry's internal thoughts that gave him depth in the first 7 books. This was forgivable since the characters' personalities still showed through their dialogue and stage directions.  Breaking the fourth wall may have been cheesy or awkward on stage, while on the other hand, some of the corny humor would be more comical watching the play with the right delivery. It's nearly impossible to envision the intricacies of the scenery, music, and effects on stage by reading this. I'm rating the script with that knowledge and not at face value. If I were to compare it to the last 7 books, zero stars would be appropriate.

The scene designations help set the stage for the characters both in the wizarding world and in the play, which made this a unique addition to the series. The pace moves VERY fast in the play compared to the past books.  This left little time for character and relationship development, but that is understandable given the format.

I was looking forward to reading this as a play, that is not the issue. The story itself has a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies (especially in ""rules"" of magical objects), and things left unexplained. Some favorite characters were thrown into the story, just for the sake of making an appearance. I wish I liked the story better than I did, but it was so cliche and predictable. Promoting this as the ""Eighth Story"" gave me false hope. It was more like a quick glance into one messy event in their future. I wish I could see the play because the superb acting, music, and exciting effects may have made the plot bearable. I LOVE Harry Potter and I wanted to love this script.

As for the ""secrets,"" grab a chair, some butterbeer and start reading.

****Character Analysis - Read ahead if you do not mind learning about some characters' personalities and backgrounds - Does not ruin the plot******

The beloved wizards we grew up with are still relevant and relatable as they have, like us, grown older and are experiencing life in a whole new light. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's personalities are somewhat consistent with the previous stories, but have evolved as they are now tackling marriage, careers, and the joys/worries of parenthood. There are moments when they are familiar, and others when you wonder what the authors were thinking. Did the creative, imaginative J.K. actually write this?

Although the story does focus a lot on their children, the baton has not completely been passed.  There were some positives. Ron's sardonic comments made me chuckle. Ginny's dry humor and quips are more profound. Hermione's intelligence, helpfulness, and compassion are endearing. Harry's fierce passion for his loved ones and what he believes, along with other traits that make these characters who they are, gave me a sense of nostalgia. I feel like Harry had time to become his true self, without the weight of Voldemort and being the ""chosen one"" on his shoulders. Although, as one can imagine, his past still haunts his life in unexpected ways.

We are even treated to the delightful, lip curling, Draco. I must say though, adulthood looks decent on him, even if it makes him a very inconsistent character.

The new generation of characters all have personalities that make sense. Rose Granger-Weasley (how fitting is that surname?) is brilliant, and a bit bossy like her mother, but is more confident in her abilities since she comes from a wizarding family.  She is quick to judge like her father, and this flaw can get the best of her, despite her good intentions and other enormous talents.

Albus Severus has not only the Potter name to live up to, but the great wizards he was named after who sacrificed their lives for the greater good. Plus, spending the last 11 years with his boisterous older brother James Sirius has molded him as the more reserved of the two. James could be the reincarnation of a stag we once knew; are we sure Harry decided not to use the resurrection stone?  This isn't to say Albus doesn't have his own voice. The House he is selected for is fitting, and with the help of his supportive parents and loyal friend, he is more than just an introverted, misunderstood teenager.

If an anthem was written about Scorpius Malfoy it would be entitled, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" He is eccentric and desperate for a real connection, being raised under an isolated, overprotective, household.  Scorpius is sharp, friendly, and intuitive. His childhood could be compared to the boy who lived in a cupboard under the stairs. Only, his cupboard extends through a Manor with an extensive library from the magical world; he at least knows who he is and where he is going.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews","12 people found this helpful"

It is a quick read, mainly because it is written as a script. I don't understand all the complaints about this since from the beginning it was advertised as such. That being said here are some of my impressions of this latest offering in the series (although strictly speaking it really isn't part of the novels, since it is just a script) - Warning SPOILERS AHEAD!:
- I enjoyed reading about Harry and Ginny's and Ron and Hermione's lives post The Battle of Hogwarts, albeit 22 years later. They are about 40 here and have matured into the responsibilities of adulthood with their respective careers and family commitments. Ron is the exception, however, retaining his goofiness and his career, if it can be called that, is running a joke shop which somehow isn't a stretch at all given his off-beat character.
-The focus of this script is on the story of Albus Potter, Harry's second son, who can't seem to measure up to his older brother James, or even his younger sister, Lily, both of whom get into Gryffindor, while Albus gets sorted into Slytherin. Albus also becomes fast friends with Skorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco Malfoy, although Skorpius here is presented as a geeky, Hermione-sort character with his fondness for books and learning. To cut to the chase, the plot focuses on Albus and Skorpius going on a quest of sorts to set things right and to bring Cedric Diggory back alive, all using a contraband Time Turner. Things off course go horribly awry, and it is left to the famous trio and even Draco to rescue their offspring.
- The story starts off in jumps and starts and the plot is a little confusing as we are taken back and forth in time, but after a brief period, things slow down enough and I was able to appreciate the narrative and where the story was taking me.
- The dissatisfying part of all this is that the story is too brief (it is after all meant to be staged as a play) and I felt a full-length novel would have done the story justice. There's not enough character development and a lot of it has to be sort of imagined.

Final Verdict - engaging and readable (a really quick read), but could have been better as a full-length novel. Although J.K. Rowling contributed ideas for the story as it says on the cover, I believe the writer of this play is Jack Thorne. Personally, I don't think it would have taken too much effort on J.K. Rowling's part to flesh this out into a novel, and fans would have been so much more grateful for the effort, but I guess we have no choice but to just enjoy this for now. You know, unlike the 7 canon books in the HP series, I don't feel the compulsion to re-read this, and that says it all, I guess.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Hill","Cursed Child was ok....","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","As a fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's superb books, I found this one disappointing. It missed the mark since it was written as a play. Rowling is one of the best children's authors of all time but we did not see this in the play. In some ways it felt disconnected - you could actually see it was written by different people in parts of it.
i think that the characters were portrayed well. Harry would have changed a lot from the time of the last book. He's an adult now struggling with work and raising his kids. Albus is a whiny teen who has never known the real struggles people went through to create a safe world. He's like so many teenagers I know today. They create problems for themselves out of nothing because life has been a bit too easy for them.
Scorpius is truly my favorite character. I don't want to give anything away by saying much more though!

You spent 7 books getting to know and love these characters, half the time during this book I couldn't even recognize these characters. They were so different and nothing like you'd imagine they'd grow up to be.
I was so excited to read this but I'm left incredibly disappointed. It's a really quick read which is probably the only reason as to why I decided to finish.
There were parts in the book that made me laugh out loud and parts that broke my heart and made me cry, those parts are because Harry, Ron, and Hermione were so out of character, some of the things that were said are things I never thought would come from their mouths.
This book has a lot to do with the past, the Triwizard Tournament and Halloween of 1981. The authors of this book created all new lines, Ludo Bagman is introducing the victors of the tournament and his lines don't match up to what was said in the 4th Harry Potter book. They changed the what happened in the past for no apparent reason. I kept waiting for Harry to say ""that's not what happened"", ""he wasn't the first one there"".
The writing was cheesy, the storyline was cheesy. I complete agree with the people who said this book feels like fan fiction. That's exactly what this is. Everything has changed and not in a good way.
If you can forget the Harry Potter series and everything that we know happened, I can see how people find this book to be amazing and love it so much. I personally cannot forget my experiences and the journey I shared with Harry Potter to fully appreciate this new story about Albus.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

Chang","Be prepared for a very different kind of Harry Potter story","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2016","Much has been said and criticized about the script format in comparison to the original novels. True, it gives the story a very different flow. Different, not better or worse. The story is actually quite enjoyable in merging the generation of characters that we know (Hermione, Ginny, Ron, Draco, and of course Harry) with their children. Surprisingly, it very much humanizes Draco and much of the Malfoy family. I did find it rather disappointing, however, that Ron is mostly regarded as a leftover and is not really given a significant role. My other criticism is that the dialogue sounds rather forced, and a few scenes, while obviously trying to pull for emotional content, are not quite effective at continuing the flow and are rather mediocre bridge scenes.

If you are a major Harry Potter fan, as many of us are, I do encourage you to read this book, as it does offer a good (but not spectacular) continuation of the story. I do not recommend this book for someone new to the Harry Potter saga, as it greatly draws from knowledge gained from previous entries. Make sure you read ALL of J.K.

When I started reading it, I could tell it just wouldn't be as fun as an actual book. The play as a play was good (at least script wise, obviously) but as a read, it was disappointing because there was little character development, and there was no real ability to fall in love with characters.

It wasn't until a few months ago that it was confirmed that an eight story was in the works. Everybody rejoiced jubilantly, including myself. But even I had a lingering doubt that this wasn't going to be what we wanted. I was right.
THE BAD:Harry Potter and  The Cursed Child,while not a terrible read, feels too much like a fanfiction. I'm certainly not the first one to say that, but it's true. The writing isn't the same, the characters are not like they were in the books, and the plot was very vague. It feels as if we have waited a long time for nothing.
THE GOOD: What I liked about this novel was the pacing. I will acknowledge that it is really just a script, but even then, the pacing is great! It never lets you go, it just pulls you into the book. Most people complained that it was in script format, but I didn't find it to be that bad. Another good thing that I liked were the new characters, Scorpio and Albus. At first I was very skeptical about Albus, being your stereotypical ""teen angst"" in a story who hates his dad. But that didn't matter because it was a perfectly understandable character. You know why he is like he is, it's explainable. Now, I personally think that Scorpio stole the show. He had a very Ron vibe, always cracking jokes, but at the same time he was a geek, a good friend, and overall a very enjoyable character. I think his relationship with Rose at the end is very funny, and I would have hoped to see more of these characters in the future. OH WAIT! J.K. Rowling said she was ""done"" with Harry Potter. That fact makes me a bit mad.
VEREDICT: While not the eight story that I wanted, it is still a must read for Harry Potter fans. It doesn't ruin the first 7 books, and it has interesting new characters. I suggest you read this book with no high hopes for a good plot. It is still enjoyable, but a bit disappointing to be honest.

P.S. Where was Teddy?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Once I reached the midway point though, the story got a lot more interesting (and I would say more familiar/comfortable as it began to draw more and more on plot elements from the book series) and I flew through the second half.

The original series was fresh and inventive.  This play took an idea that's been done over and over in other movies and books, which is the idea of what happens if there is a different outcome. I could deal with that if the characters weren't so far off base, for example Ron comes off as a doofus and Harry is cold towards his son and except for the beginning we forget he has 2 other children.  Also, even knowing this was a play format you can't help but miss Rowlings prose.

Truth be told, reading this book gave me such an ambivalent feeling that I'm not exactly sure of what I thought about it, nevertheless I do have some very clear opinions.

1. The fact that the format is a script and not a novel had a huge impact on me and my enjoyment of the book. It made everything feel a bit chopped and extremely fast, not at all what I was used to from all the original books in the series but since it will be difficult for me to go to London and experience the play this publication will have to do for me.

2. Scorpius is a great surprise, quite a lovable character. All the other kids presented in this story are just a bit, very, irritating and just annoying and somewhat self entitled.

3. Ron lacks shine, the character comes off bland and just not what one remembers of him.

At the end I understand, or at least I think I understand, the fact that no matter how magical this world is the people in it are human even though they're witches and wizards, they are first and foremost, human. They are flawed no matter how much we love them and I do love them, even with this book. I'll always love them and I'm grateful for the original series and to Rowling for writing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

L. Schneider","Two lies are written on the back of this book","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","The first, that this is the 8th story. It's not. This is a guy writing fan fiction and slapping JK's name on the cover so it will sell. The second is that it's 19 years later. No. The events in this book happen 22 years later.

It's a shame because there's a lot of possibility here. There are interesting storylines taking place here, they just aren't executed on the level we've come to expect from a Rowling product. I'm a sucker for a good time travel story, as well as revisiting beloved characters much later in life. But this isn't how these characters act. Albus should never have been this whiny. I liked him in the 7th book. I liked Harry in the original 7. But, here, the characters have become annoying or flat. With Ron he was actually just describing either Fred or George!

I also just wasn't a fan of how entwined in the story Harry was. Like, I've already seen him and everything he's capable of in the original 7 books. Now, he's a blubbering fool. You can't sit there and tell me that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to run to Ginny every time he has a minor problem. That and I don't want to read about his life working a 9 to 5. I work a 9 to 5. That's not interesting to me because I live it everyday. Give me more Albus and Scorpius!

The only intriguing part of this for me was when we focus solely on the kids. No, they don't act like normal kids, but honestly, I just wanted to see how they would interact with each other. I know the adult's story and I just want to focus on someone else, now.

Another very problematic thing for me was the fact that we spend a good chunk of the book fast forwarding to get where we need to be. Why waste all that time? Why not start us where we need to be? Why not go further in depth for the moments you do skip over? Entire books could be written for the amount of time we skipped in the beginning of this book. I wanted much more from this story. Answer some how's and why's while you're skimming through the years.

No one can write these characters or this universe like Rowling and no one should. I'm going to have to exclude the ""8th"" story from my yearly reading of these books, unfortunately. Fantastic Beasts looks great, though, and that is a truly Jo Rowling production.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews","134 people found this helpful"

Like many others I grew up with the frachise, the characters were my friends. Still, this newest stage production sent me for a loop.

First thing I want to say, after reading the stage directions is that a lot of action and movement is happening, so I don't think the script does the play justice. I've only heard positive reviews of the cast.

However, the story seems over burdened by plot holes and a lack of characterization. And I do mean that. Yes it is a script, but there are so many plus out there that have so much depth to them, and this seemed more like a fan service. For example, copying old lines or bringing back dead heroes for a short while.

It had characters who seemed OOC, and plot lines that didn't seem realistic in the magical world. It also directly contradicts several things in the books. For spoiler reasons I won't get into them. But really. Some things don't make the least bit of sense...

Now the positives,  this play was a Malfoy redemption arch and did some great things for them (and some mean things too sadly). It also handled PTSD and parental relationships well. So in that way, the play certainly has depth. Just out of character depth.

I would still recommend reading it, but I fall in the category of people who treat this as an entertaining fanfiction over canon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

It is with great sadness that I say that J.K. Rowling is a sell out. The book is okay, but not Harry Potter worthy. If you're planning on writing an eighth plot to the greatest series ever written, it cannot be anything short of extraordinary. And Harry Potter and the Cursed Child fell incredibly short. If you want to read a story about teenage angst and awkward conversations, this is the book for you. This book has huge plot holes, is not consistent with the other novels, and adds unrealistic twists to carry the plot. I'm not mad, just disappointed.

Read the book, because it is worth the read.

The dialogue between the characters, even the now grown up Harry and company, seemed to be geared to the younger set. Yes the original books were also geared for the pre-teen to teens but the dialogue was different.  Corny when it had to be, but not as much as this play seems to have.

It was fun to have one's memory of the books refreshed as you could tell where J. K. Rowling's influence was in the story line.

I always like to follow Characters as they age and being able to see Harry and the gang all grown up seemed especially exciting. How disappointing. I feel like JK Rowling was only a part of this book in terms of character names, new spell encantations, and history from the original series.  I feel like the writers were hoping to recapture the magic- no pun intended- and fell short. I wanted Harry to be a better father than he was. I wanted his children to all be dull of life and vibrance. I wanted them to be normal happy children with a life that Harry didn't get to have. Instead they have a dad who seems like a past-his-prime professional athlete, not the Harry Potter we all love. I gave 3 stars because the story was well written although a Bit odd in some places, for instance the two best friends seem like they might one day be more than friends except one is in love with Rose. It jumps back and forth. I wanted the original characters to be grown up versions of themselves and not tired old people. They worked so hard as children only to grow up to be those tired, unexciting ministry workers from the first books.

All in all, this was an unnecessary ploy to get books sold.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews","9 people found this helpful"

However, the format is very different from what we are used to.  When the plot is parred down to dialogue only, it's easier to see the flaws.  I am giving this three stars because I found some of the story to be around 4 stars (the new characters, especially Scorpious and Rose) and others to be around 2 (the plot and dialogue,) so I took the average.  Honestly, I wish that Rowling had developed more books focused on the new generation of wizards with cameos by Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, especially if she was going to change them so much.  Suddenly, Harry is claiming that he is a horrible father because he had no role models growing up.  How about Mr. Weasley?  Or Hagrid?  This Hermoine is bossy, but not in a good way.  This Ron is a one dimensional jokester like his brothers (and he's seemingly only there for comic relief.) He actually shows regression instead of growth.  It's a little disrespectful to him.  The character of Scorpious stole the show.  Rose has a lot of potential, but was completely underutilized here.  Frankly, Albus is the focus and much of the time, he just is not likable.  I liked the theme of friendship as well as fathers and sons. There was real promise with these themes.  But these things aren't developed enough because of the crazy, frenzied time travel element, which sort of takes away from the rest of the story.  It drives most of the plot and the story relies on it too much.  I wanted to love this.  I found it just okay.  I suspect it's much better on the stage and in person.  But I wish it were a book so I could get to know the characters' thoughts and motivations better.  I'd love to get to know Scorpious, James, Lily and Rose, but I guess that isn't happening now.  Considering that Rowling is now done, I kind of wish she had left it alone.  This was a mere taste of the new characters, and the time travel took away from us getting to know them.  As an aside, Draco comes off well, as does Ginny.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews","5 people found this helpful"

I quite liked the play style for something different. With being so familiar with what the various places look like in the Harry Potter world, having it as a script didn't detract from being immersed in the story.
I felt the story itself could have been a little bit more..something, the plot style was not really what I was expecting and didn't feel like what one is used to from Harry Potter. Seeing the characters grown up and interactions between previous rivals and allies was interesting and as usual there is always a deeper message/s to be found from the story.

My dad used to travel to England and would buy my mom the Harry Potter books before they were popular in the States.  She would read them first and then I would get my chance to read them.  They were a fun treat.

When I heard there was a new Harry Potter book coming out I was immediately on alert.  What more could author J.K. Rowling and friends have to add to Potter’s story?  I began to research and learned that this latest installation wasn’t written in novel format like the previous seven books, but as a script.  This threw me for a loop.  A Harry Potter play?  Set in his adult years?  I was more than skeptical.

When release day finally came I balked at purchasing the book.  I just couldn’t do it.  I was too afraid I would be disappointed.  However, about a month later, I found a stack of forlorn looking Harry Potter and the Cursed Child books sitting on the shelf at my local library.  I felt compelled to take one home and read the latest Potter tale.

I wish I could write that it was everything I had imagined and more, but alas, it was not.  I’m just not a fan of reading plays.  I prefer the author to magically weave stories through colorful, imaginative narration. I feel that plays are a bit too cut and dry for my taste and during my reading I found myself missing the flesh and fluff of the previous novels.  Perhaps I just lack imagination myself and need the guiding hand of the author to take me to another place and time.

The first half of the play took me a while to get into.  It was like trudging through water.  I felt like I just needed to get through this book.  I wanted to love it, but sadly I didn’t.  I wasn’t invested in or convinced by the new characters.  The returning characters lacked their original charm.  I found Harry whiny and sad, Ginny was tired and dull, I felt Ron was a doormat, and Hermione lacked her take charge, know-it-all attitude.  In essence, they had simply grown up and lost their magic…and I was not prepared for that.  This caused me to wonder, had I done the same thing?  (Glass shattering moment)

The second half of the book picked up the interest and the pace.  I was intrigued by the friendships in the second generation.  I found it interesting to think about the alternate realities of Harry Potter’s world.  Exploring these alternate realities conjured up memories of those childhood classic Choose Your Own Adventure stories.

After finishing the book, I began to realize that this could be the last installation.  The seventh book had us all craving more Potter, but perhaps we really should let him go.  It is time.  I found this script cathartic in that way.  I’m no longer longing for more of Harry Potter and his crew.  I’m satisfied with reading where they all ended up and don’t need a follow up.  For this therapeutic reason, I am giving the latest Harry Potter a 3 stars.  It hurts me to do this because I wanted so much to give it a 5.  But the script and the aging of the characters threw me.  As I stated before, I wasn’t prepared.  It’s not realistic, but I expected the characters to be ageless and not share my own problems.  Which is silly, because of course that’s what drew us all to the characters in the first place – they were relatable because of their issues, but in a magical way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

If thinking about purchasing this, you must first understand that it is a script, not a novel. Therefore it does not go into the depth and detail of the original novels, nor is it written as a narrative; it's a script. And while it had input from Rowling, the input of two additional writers is quite apparent. That being said, the actual plot line is enjoyable, but weak. At several times, it felt as though I were reading a piece of fan-fiction, rather than canon Harry Potter. I won't spoil the plot for anyone, but let's just say that it is a plot that has already been covered by many an amateur fan-fiction writer. After becoming used to Rowling's ability to create plots that offer twists, turns and totally unforeseen events in the original novels, this falls short. It stands apart from the other canon in that there is nothing tying it's plot in with the originals, no breadcrumbs left in the novels that make the reader suddenly go ""ah ha, I see where this plot line was seeded."" In fact, I found the opposite to be true, where certain events seem like they couldn't possibly have gone unnoticed in the Deathly Hallows. Unlike the original novels, it is not something I would re-read again and again. I finished it slightly unsatisfied, still unsure of exactly which character was supposed to be the cursed child (or perhaps it was intentional for more than one character to fit that role). Overall, it was enjoyable to spend a few more hours in Harry's world, and I can see the appeal of viewing this story as a play. The special effects described in the script would be truly magical to witness on stage, and I would take the opportunity to see it if it ever comes to a stage near me. But in the end, it is a weaker story than those in the original novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As I have grown, my love of JK Rowling's world and works has only grown. I have anxiously awaited a story following the adventures and misadventures of the children of the characters I grew up relating to so profoundly. Given those facts, I had such high expectations that I knew, deep down, that in some small way I would be left disappointed with anything other than a full length novel. I knew going in that this was not going to be that.

There were so many things about this play/story/book that were right... and yet I also feel like lots of things were 'wrong'.

Spoilers coming!!!

Rights:
Albus' struggle with his own identity and not measuring up to his father and older brother
Every single thing about Scorpius Malfoy
The continued love and relationship of Ron and Hermione
Intricacies within the wizarding world
The temporary resurrection of Snape

Wrongs:
Every single thing about Harry. I feel like he was pictured to be a shell of his former self. Nothing about his dialog and behaviors seemed to be true to the character we all know.
Ron was painted to be a bumbling simpleton.
I feel like the ending was, well, lame. The whole pigeon thing was just bizarre.
A weeping, sniveling Dumbledore
All in all, it was a nice story. I feel like I needed to read this to be able to form my own opinions.

Will I read this time and time again, like I have with all of my nearly-worn-out Harry Potter books? Nah. Probably not. I will give it another go in a few weeks to see if it has grown on me, but it likely wont get a third read.

Would I recommend that others read it? Probably. Yes. I think that everyone needs to be able to decide for themselves if this is the closure they needed. For me, it wasn't. But for others? Possible.

In all honesty, I have MUCH preferred the full length novel fan fics by G Norman Lippert following James Potter and the gang to this. Which, I suppose, is all the review this truly needs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

In my mind I definitely wasn't giving this one a fair chance. I don't like reading in playwright format, but I flew through this one. It's not even J.K. Rowling... but that didn't matter either. These two guys that wrote this one did her stories justice.
Was I blown away to give it a perfect rating? No.
Did I like it? Overall, yes.
I liked how it picked up where the films and the last book leave off. You are left wondering what happens with Harry's family, since you get that glimpse. This story gives you everything you want and more.
What I didn't care for was the bopping around to different scenes. I get it's a play so it's different, but some were to cut and dry for me. Especially coming from such huge books from Rowling. This was like a tidbit.
Still good though, and fans of the series should read it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It reads a bit like an angsty fan fiction. It seems to revel in the misery of the characters, but obviously loves the series and its mythos.

Parts of it are quite touching and good- I especially like the characterizations of the adults- though they did a bit of a character nerf to Ron a few times, similar to how they did it in the films where they took away his smarts and strategy and instead had him act as the only levity to be found.
Ginny was characterized well (unlike the films, yeesh), as were Harry Draco and Hermione.

As for the news cast...
I love Scorpius, and how he is just a genuinely sweet fellow who is a total nerd.
Albus is just about the worst character I've ever read. He has no redeeming features, except that he cares about Scorpius- and even that comes across as a form of rebellion against his dad rather than genuine friendship.
Rose is a snot, and I was sad to see her barely in this at all.

The plot.... It isn't true to Harry Potter and actually breaks many of the laws of magic we know, and does not have a plot structured similarly to the mysteries of the HP books.

PLOT SPOILERS AND MORE AHEAD
Time travel doesn't work how it did in Prisoner of Azkaban.
This is not really a mystery- it's 'The Butterfly Effect' set in the harry potter universe.

I'm genuinely not sure who the cursed child is, felt the rumors of 'he's the child of Voldemort' were shoehorned in, and hated Delphi for being boring and with a motivation that seemed tenuous- as did Albus's for trying to save Cedric Diggory. The whole main plot felt arbitrarily chosen. A Voldie/Bellatrix love child? Saving Cedric? Why did she even bother dealing with these teens- she could have just stolen the time turner!

The sequences with the adults were good- the time travel ones read rather poorly and seem to have 'off' choices. The script seemed to almost Queer-bait a Scorpius/Albus relationship- and very poorly. Then they'd hamfistedly establish 'but don't worry, they are straight! See!!!'

They over-redeemed Snape, over bamfed Hermione in certain scenes, under bamfed Ron,

The heart of the play- the relationship between Harry and his son- felt completely one-sided. Albus is truly a horrible kid, and Harry can't connect with him- but I don't see how anyone could. He's awful. He's not compassionate, kind, funny, smart, interesting or compelling. All he does is complain. I tried to like him, but I couldn't find one scene where he drew me in.

The one scene that truly touched me deeply was Harry having to witness his parent's deaths, and do nothing to stop them. It made tears appear in my eyes.

The 'clever' scenes in this, weren't. :( Delphi wasn't all that smart, Hermione's safeguards in her office and the riddles were sadly oversimplistic, and the even Al's 'use the blanket!' didn't seem to make sense, as what were the chances that his father would come across it in time? The 'prophecies' in this were quite weak. At one point they time travel and Rose no longer lives- but really, shouldn't Al and Scorpius not either? It makes no sense. Their 'rules' for time travel are non-existent. (And Cedric turning evil seemed untrue to the books.)

Scorpius's mother's passing was glossed over, and added nothing in particular to the plot except give Draco some more angst- and show more evidence of how thoughtless and horrible Albus is.

So, to sum up-
It's ok. The adults part are fun to read. The children's individual scenes are only good when Scorpius is talking, and the overarching plot is just a few Butterfly Effect time travel sequences for no real reason. Who is the cursed child? Who knows. I say it's Albus, because he's the worst.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I am shocked when reading some of the reviews, If you did not know it was a script, you should just re-read the title.  However, I feel it was to much a tease to turn this into a book.  The story line barely brought me back to that same feeling i got reading through the pages of Goblet of Fire or Hablf Blood Prince.  You can tell this was written by more then just J.K.

I feel like the emotion portrayed by the characters were true to what I imagined the older generation. Harry is still plagued by a past he never wanted; Ron is goofy, which I think he is more so since Fred is no longer around; Hermione is still head strong and being the best at everything she does (I loved how she used the bookcase as a weapon); and Draco is exactly what I imagined, still tore up about his past with new present problems. My heart broke when he was confiding in Harry about the death of his wife. The children were also exactly how I imagined.

I read a lot of fan fiction and I know a lot about the family trees and the actual history of the Harry Potter world, but there were a couple characters I was hoping to finally see or see again. (1) Teddy Remus Lupin - we were all upset when the relationship of Remus and Tonks wasn't portrayed in the movies; it was such a beautiful thing in the middle of war and death. AND THEY HAD A CHILD! And, guess who is the god father of said child? Harry Potter. I kept hoping Teddy would swoop in as the big brother and try to talk to Albus on Harry's behalf, but it didn't happen. (2) Older Mrs. Weasley - she was mentioned but she never popped up. I adore that woman; she's a mother on all fronts and a total bad a** of a woman. Molly Weasley is mom goals. I found myself wishing she was in the middle of the action because she doesn't play around when it comes to her family. She would have got things done quickly. A lot of my favorite characters are dead so the list is short. I did enjoy having Snape back for a moment; it was nice to see that he never changed sides, despite Harry's death.

Voldemort having a daughter definitely threw me off. We all knew that he can't love anyone because of the love potion he was conceived under, but I guess we never thought that he could still have sex and reproduce. I'm guessing Bellatrix was fixing to push out a baby when she was gang was locked up in Malfoy Manor in the last book?

I do think this would have been better as a book, especially since I haven't seen the play yet. It needed more description. I found myself needing to see what the characters looked like (yes, I did look up the cast). I needed to see the wrinkles from years of worry and watching over their shoulders. I needed to see the grey in Hermione's hair from running the Ministry and thinking about the time she is missing with her children. I needed to see the laugh lines around Ron's eyes from running the joke shop with George because we all know that Fred would want the both of them laughing and smiling with their customers.

This script was a good fix for my Harry Potter addiction, but now I'm left wanting more about the next generation. I also need a prequel about the Marauders generation, but I shall not hold my breath.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

If you try to think of this as an 8th book to the Harry Potter series, you will be sorely disappointed. It is not at all like the books. I did, however, still enjoy it as a Harry Potter fan.

Harry's son Albus and Draco's son Scorpius both start Hogwarts the same year, and become fast friends. This play is really about them, with plenty of fan service to old characters thrown in. You will hear plenty from Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and Draco too.

Important to note is that this ""book"" is really a play script, intended to be performed as a play. You are not going to find rich description like you would in a book, or scenes that would be impossible or very difficult to enact on stage in front of an audience.

Is this a greatly written story? No, but it is fun to relive some new experiences with some old characters. This story is also written as more of an older children's book. It has more of a feel similar to the 1st and 2nd Harry Potter books than, say, the 5th and 6th ones. While the original books grew in maturity with their audience, this is more of a ""go back to your roots"" story than a continuation into new adult or adult fiction.

Because this is a play, the character development is very different. Characters were not very well developed, and I only found myself caring about characters because I knew so much about them from the previous series. This really felt like a fan service story rather than a fully developed one. I don't think that someone unfamiliar with Harry Potter would enjoy reading or seeing this play. I don't think they could get invested in the characters.

While in many places the script tries to make you feel a sense of dread or worry, it fails horribly at it. Other times it tries to feed off of corny humor, and that works some of the time. The ending was satisfying enough. It didn't leave feeling unfinished, but there wasn't a lot of suspense or unrest on the way there.

Rating

I give this book a 2.5 out of 5. If you're a Harry Potter fan and would like to read a little fan service, it's worth the one time read. I look forward to seeing the play someday too. If you're not, I'd steer clear. You likely won't enjoy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I knew that it was a script and I also knew that it would probably not be up to the awesome level of the other books becouse J.K. Rowling was not the only writer of the book. When I opened up the book/script I felt tolerably optimistic. I mean if J.K. Rowling was a part of it, it couldn't be that bad. As page after underwhelming page went by my spirits dropped down and down and down, untill finaly some 300 pages layer the book came to an end. Honestly I felt pretty let down, the book was even more disappointing than I expected. The charactors were not funny and witty like Ron, Hermione and Harry were. The humor was more bland and average than that of the previous books. The story line itself was enough to get a four star rating from me- it made barely any sense! The theory of time travel within the series (not beeing able to change the future, only doing doing what was ment to happen in the first place) was completely changed. I don't what to spoil any more of the discombobulating plot, in case you deside to read it but lets just say that I have not told the worst of it ( those of you who have read it will know what I am talking about!). That said, I realize that it is a script and it must be pretty awesome to see live on stage. And who knows you may love it! As Dumbedore said, ""Happiness can be found in the darkest of places if only you remember to turn on the light""

I love the original series. It is easily one of the most magical stories ever told. It is written at an amazing pace and the characters are brilliantly multi-layered. Every character stays true to themselves from the Sorcerer's Stone through the Deathly Hallows. This is not the case in The Cursed Child.

The general story is not the problem. I enjoyed the overall idea of this tale. My main complaint is that the pacing is WAY too fast. It removes the character development aspect of the story which was so crucial to the main series. It makes it nearly impossible to care for any of the new characters. This particular story would be much better as a novel rather than a screenplay.

The other big issue is that beloved characters act in ways that seem inconsistent with the characters fans have come to love. The only character that I loved just as much in this story as in the original series is Professor McGonagall. Multiple characters act in ways they never would have in the original series.

It is clear the Rowling did not write this from the start which is too bad because she may have made this as beautiful as her other masterpieces.

Was expecting better writing! You Should still get it and read it for yourself.","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","I cannot say there was any part of this book that sent me back to the HP world that I know and love. I knew this was a script and not going to be in book form. That wasn't it. I was okay with that part. My imagination is good enough to fill in those blanks. I knew it wasn't written by JK herself. That someone else wrote it and she approved it. My thoughts where that SHE KNOWS HER CHARACTERS and if she approved it that it would be spot on.

I am not here  to say that I know the Harry Potter characters better than JK. That is ridiculous in my opinion. They are her creation after all. Some say that this book/play isn't in ""canon"". That anything outside the 7 books don't fit in this world. That is also far-fetched to me. This world and this canon are JK's. If she wants Harry to grow up, dress in drag, and date Peeves (non of that happened btw), she can! It is in canon and part of that world. This world is JK's after all. W are only lucky to be part of it.

I am here to say that I have my own thoughts on what characters would and would not say. That there were some things that the main people said and did that just blew me away. Not in a good way. There is one main thing that Harry Potter says that, in my opinion and I feel most everyone else's, he would never ever ever ever say. Never! By the time I got to that part of the story, I was already put off.

The characters apparently grow up and become completely different people. Say and do things they would never do in my opinion. They all but forget Harry and Ginny's other two kids. There are two stand out points in the book. They are interesting but lacking. The idea of this story line is great. Which I feel like is JK's part to this story. The writing itself and the character development is awful.

The story itself bounces around all over the place. They drag one beloved character from the past through the mud. Harry smacks close to the Harry we loved to hate in Order of the Phoenix. The moody and annoyingly ""why me"" Harry. Ginny reminds me a lot of Molly in the book. There is no mention of George. Ron is the closest to the Ron that I imagined. Hermione grows up and reverts back to the pre-troll version of herself. Albus Potter needs a good smack and I actually like Draco's boy, Scorpious. I cannot say that it was this way for everyone else. I kept expecting something to happen between Albus and Scorpious.

Don't go in expecting this to be a wonderful addition, THE 8th book in the Harry Potter world. They could have given us this information in a post on Pottermore and I wouldn't have been as disappointed. You will be able to tell pretty early in that this was NOT WRITTEN BY JK. It feels more like a fan-fiction. With that in mind, I've actually read fan-fiction that was so much better than The Curse Child is. The main characters in this book apparently grow up to become other people. There is weird things added in like dragging people through the mud, time turners that don't make sense, and hand grenade pumpkin pasties...yeah. You read that right. Think ""Anything off the trolley"" and then the sweet old lady growing spike and throwing exploding pumpkin sweets....weird. Just plain weird.

I wanted to much for this to be amazing. I think that is why I went to bed this morning wholly disappointed. I feel that the only positive thing this story had was taking me back to my childhood. Reminding me of midnight releases and the wonderful anticipation of a new story. It failed miserably in everything else.

Should you buy it and read it? Yes. I think if you love the Harry Potter stories or have read them then you should read this as well. It does add to the stories. It was fun to see them all grown up. There is no other reason to read it. It isn't fantastic or a great piece of literature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","5 people found this helpful"

Did it bring back the excitement of Wizarding World? Of course. Were the characters well developed and the plot well written? Solid nope. Like many of the other reviews stated, the book reads like fan fiction and I don't understand how Rowling could approve of it. The characters personalities are off and their actions are absurd. I found this to be a quick read but it can't hold a candle to the original series. For the sake of Hogwarts and all that is holy, please do not ever have anyone but Rowling write in the voice of her characters.

I grew up with the books, and I was completely satisfied with how the story ended 9 years ago. I wasn't left wanting a sequel in any form, but to my surprise here it is. First of all this is a script for a play and not a proper novel, so I'm aware that it is probably different watching it performed rather than read. However the story is just flat out odd to say the least. It focuses mainly on Harry's son Albus and how he's trying to live up to his father's name but is seemingly failing at it. I was at first intrigued by this exploration in the relationship between these two characters, but was quickly disappointed by the fact that the story then revolves around Albus trying to fix something that happened around Harry during the events of the fourth book through means that I won't spoil.

This is a disappointing way to tell the story. I would have rather have seen a brand new story that didn't rely so heavily on the materials from the previous installments. Basically during the play Albus and Scorpious (a fun duo) make huge mistakes during the course of the story, and fix them within minutes. Scenes are far to short, the gravity of these mistakes is never properly felt because they're fixed so quickly. Dialogue is also poorly written and most of the returning characters don't really act like themselves.

In short, even though there are flashes of what could have been, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a disappointment due to a short but crammed story and obvious fan fiction influences.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

If you're looking for something exactly like the HP series books 1-7 you're not going to get it with 'Harry Potter, and the Cursed Child'. Book 8(HP and the Cursed Child) brings back most of the main characters who we fell in love with in the original series. I thought I always wanted to know what happened to all my beloved characters, but I'm not so sure now. I have a few issues with this book. One being that this book is written in a play format so reading it is kind of hard if you're not used to that, which I'm not. I haven't read a play since I was in high school(16 years).
It reads as follows(no spoilers)
*** -Ginny and Harry are angry
Harry What do you want Draco
Draco gives Harry a dirty look
Draco You know what I want Harry. I want you to write a retraction.
Harry is very angry, his face is fire red
Harry I don't have any control over the paper Draco.(ect, ect, ect)-***
My sister got her copy before I did, and warned me about the way the book was written so I wasn't surprised, but it still took me about 20(ish) pages to get used to the play format. Another thing is that I don't think J K Rowling had ANYTHING to do with this book other then putting her name on the cover as one of the authors(maybe she wrote a sentence or two?). It feels like the two men who did write this book only read the CLIFF Notes of the Harry Potter series because this book lacks almost everything I hold so dear from the original series. I think I would have been happier if the last I heard of Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Draco was when they said ""Good bye"" to their own children on platforms 9&3/4 at the end of book 7. On the positive side it's an easy read so finishing it shouldn't take too long. I just need to find the time.
Also if you haven't read or watched 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' in the past 6-12 months I suggest you go watch it so you are fresh on where Harry, and the gang left us. It might make reading 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' a little easier for you. Plus watching any of the Harry Potter series is never a waist of time. Lol.

Gilligan","Odd addendum to the beloved series","Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2018","This coda to the wildly successful and tremendously entertaining seven-volume Harry Potter series of novels that transformed Young Adult literature is rather peculiar. First, it deviates from the narrative form of the seven novels—it’s a play. And although it retains much of the charm and wonder of the Harry Potter universe, its true focus is somewhat more profound—the complicated dynamics of parent-child relationships.

In this story, our favorite Hogwarts trio—Harry, Hermione, and Ron—are all adults with children who attend (of course) Hogwarts. Draco Malfoy’s son Scorpius plays a major role in the story as well. As for the “cursed child” of the ambiguous title, there are three candidates: Scorpius, Harry’s son Albus Severus Potter, and Delphi, a mysterious young lady who turns out to have quite an ominous heritage.

The story deftly balances plot and character development, using time travel to display the complex relationships among generations, and although Harry himself is not the protagonist of this tale, his hybrid position as both orphaned child and husband/father sharply foregrounds the challenges of parenting faced by those who grew up without strong parental role models.

This might seem rather “heavy,” but Tiffany and Thorne manage to infuse the story with the requisite dose of Potter magic. Recommended for all muggles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

He was setup as a sort of combo Ron/Hermione to Albus's Harry, so he's studious and clever and awkward and jokey and full of heart.

I also really enjoyed that Harry and Draco's sons became best friends and seeing the interactions between the two fathers as they navigated that.

I'm mixed on the fact that the plot was setup in such a way that we got to revisit characters or relationships that we thought were done with. Going back to these was lovely, but I'll admit that structuring the plot this way was also the biggest weakness of the play; it felt like a cop-out to deal so heavily with time travel just for the nostalgia. I also agree with other reviewers that the characters were not consistent with who we know them to be, and the dialogue, particularly for the younger characters, was a bit hard to believe.

There's not much in the way of character development here, and the emotional issues are somewhat over-dramatized, perhaps to fill in for the lacking plot. I think I would have preferred if the ""adventure"" part of the plot were a bit lighter and the emotional story were more subtly explored instead.

I'm sure that this script is hugely better with the great acting, effects, costuming, staging, etc. that I've heard is given to the London production, but I must say that the stage instructions were a lot of fun to read. That's one of my favorite things about reading plays because you get a glimpse at descriptions, sometimes with very specific or interesting wording, that, as a viewer of the play, you would only see translated into the acting. Most of the time, the translation of the acting (and staging and whatnot) is going to add a lot more than you lose by not getting the description, but seeing the exact words can be so funny and so telling.

Overall, the plot was a bit forced, and the characters pretty one-dimensional--which is probably why they don't seem true to the original characters, who were all far more complex than presented here--but this will hit hard in the nostalgia department. I think the Cursed Child is best summed up as this: we were all excited to go back to Hogwarts with Harry, but we actually went back with Albus, and he doesn't much like Hogwarts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews","4 people found this helpful"

It's not a book that the play was based off it, it's actually the script of the play. As such, reading it is a little awkward.

Secondly, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and downloaded this book immediately. I wish it had been a bonafide full-length action-packed book like the originals, but maybe nothing can really live up to those? I finished it in a few hours. I found parts of the plot to be a little forced, and it was admittedly strange reading about Harry, Ron, and Hermione all grown-up.

The book follows Harry and Ginny's youngest son Albus over his first year at Hogwarts. Like his dad, he gets into trouble. Harry is OK at being a dad, you forgive him because despite how cool he is; he really did have terrible role models growing up. However, the action is like when you're watching a romance film and everything bad happens because of a misunderstanding. Unlike in the original series, where Harry and friends are forced into crazy situations, in this book it all sort of seems to unfold because of poor decisions. I do think that had it been more drawn out there could have been other plot lines to help round out the story and make it more believable.

That said, I'm VERY much looking forward to when I can snag myself some tickets to see the play. I think that it'll be great in play form, lighthearted, and just enough to sate the Harry Potter appetite.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The puny read takes but a few hours, and is a pleasant enough diversion through the wizard’s world, but it is definitely designed with diehards in mind. With an extremely clunky time-travel narrative, the book is really more of an excuse to revisit Potter’s greatest hits from yesteryear, where many favorite scenes and characters are replayed covers like a fan-fic tribute. Some might find these replayed scenes blasphemous and unnecessary, others will rejoice at witnessing the greatest hits. Also, to read the script also sacrifices the spectacle of witnessing the fully-produced play too. I’m sure as many people will love this work as hate it. To one without any horse in the race, it may have been simple and unnecessary, but it was still a nostalgic and well-paced diversion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany is a sequel of sorts to Rowling’s tremendously famous Harry Potter novels. This is probably one of the only things people who’ve read it so far will agree on. Now, the book was released because the play is only being shown in England and fans elsewhere would have thrown a fit if they weren’t able to experience it in some way. It’s important to remember going in that this is a play script rather than a novel. That actually affects a lot in this review as well as my general feelings towards the book.

The story follows Albus Severus, his friend Scorpius, and Harry Potter the father who could do better as Albus and Scorpius attempt to set right what once went wrong. Albus and Harry have nothing in common, something that we are led to think gets thrown in Albus’ face quite a bit at school. He can’t measure up to his famous dad and Harry doesn’t have the time to spend with him for them to work through that. So he grows bitter over the first few years he’s at Hogwarts, until an overheard conversation leads him to stealing a time-turner to go save Cedric Diggory. This is all fine, I’m good with this plot line.  What I feel like the script needed was a little more attention to each different version of the timeline, consequences essentially. I would have also liked to have seen more of the villain prior to the very end.

All that said, is it a good Harry Potter novel? Well, no, if you walk into reading this expecting a Harry Potter novel you will be very disappointed. The language used for a novel and a script are very different, with plays being as visual as they are the book lacks a lot of the description that a novel would have and you don’t get much about how characters feel beyond the occasional note for clarification. The story also feels disjointed in places because of scene shifts and not being able to see the actors’ reactions directly. That said, it’s a script, so I can’t really hold it to novel standards. As far as scripts go, I could have gone with more stage direction in the book itself to help follow what was going on, but it wasn’t bad.  My big problem with Cursed Child is that it lacks the scope the series proper felt like it had, the weight of consequence when characters made choices. Partly because of how directly involved they were in things compared to how successful they were, the villain also felt very small, again, I’d have liked to see more build up there.

As to the good parts, I really liked Scorpius and the way that wanting to take care of him humanized Malfoy. The friendship between Scorpius and Albus was also pretty fun, I would have actually like to have seen that used to give us more insight into some of the other young characters. I appreciate that the golden trio mess up massively, even as adults, especially things like Harry not keeping up with his paperwork. More effort needed to have been given to showing that Harry is under a tremendous amount of stress though, there is a scene that feels very out of character because of this lack.

So, what’s the long and short of this? How does Harry Potter and the Cursed Child rank? For me, it gets a solid three out of five. There was a lot wrong that could have and should have been worked out better, especially given that plays tend to go through multiple runs. The language was off, again that difference between novels and scripts, and didn’t feel like J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter. The characters could have all been more developed. But, the story is pretty good if a little too much like early aughts fan fiction, and it makes me want to see the show. That I think is the big thing here, there isn’t a sequel to worry over, but reading the script does make me want to see the play. I think that’s a pretty fair measure of it doing its job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I see where they were going with this story. I really do. But I feel as if it was executed pretty poorly. The eighth story being in script form isn't what made it poor, although that didn't help either.
The plot line itself is a sort of an interesting one. Voldemort having a child seemed pretty crazy, but intriguing nonetheless. It also interested me that Snape was in the mix along the way (I'm a huge fan of Snape) and that Scorpious was nothing like Draco and more like a Hermione type. Blah blah blah.
What didn't interest me though...the rest of the story. Yes, Ron, Harry and Hermione showed glimpses of the Ron, Harry and Hermione we knew in the first seven books but I feel like they were not true to character in the eighth. That may be JKR and the other writers trying to convey how people can change with age but it did me no justice as an HP fan to learn that they had turned into pretty boring adults.
I think JKR needs to write a full story with no contributions from anyone else and with a few differences in the plot line...and just maybe it will be a good eighth installment to the series I revolve my life around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

However, I was disappointed in the execution for several reasons. First, the material was hard to picture as a stage adaptation. I have not been able to see the play in person, and while I’m sure the production is top-notch, as a reader, it was hard to picture the actions in my mind. Secondly, the plot moved too quickly, resolving itself in a non-realistic way for the Harry Potter universe. Third, the magic wasn’t there for me. At first, the plot seemed to mimic the friendships readers saw in the original Harry Potter series. I admit I was excited to see the characters I grew up with as an older generation. But, it just seemed off. It’s hard to explain a feeling or lack thereof, but this adaptation was not my favorite. It’s difficult to say that because I absolutely loved Fantastic Beasts in both formats—written and on screen. Fantastic Beasts captured the magical universe of Harry Potter instantaneously, while Cursed Child failed to draw me into the basic plot.

Despite this adaptation not being my favorite, I could not give it lower than a 3 out of 5. It is still linked to the Harry Potter universe, which I believe gives it some credibility. There were certain scenes I enjoyed, although they were far and few between. The main reason, I gave it a 3 out of 5 is because I would be interested in seeing it as a stage performance. I think the screenplay is missing the experience of sitting in a theater and watching a live performance. That in itself is truly magical.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As I read the last pages I was both sad that the book was over and sad that it had only offered a semblance of the main series. It didn't pave new and interesting aspects of the magical world and it lacked the whimsical and well written scenery that was depicted in the main series. The ""magic"" of Rowling's magical world was something the reader got as they read between the lines and put together the scene, the play, perhaps by venture of being a screenplay, fails to capture that same slowly unfolding magical scene that enchants the reader. Writing style however is not the real crux of the issue here (SPOILERS AHEAD) is the use of time turners as the central plot point, in an entire magical world with endless possibilities for other stories we just get a collection of time travel tropes. However beyond any amount of bad writing and poor plot devices, I was appalled at the poor facsimiles of our former heroes. I won't even begin to bring up the newly created plot holes should you accept this book as canonical. (END SPOILERS) In summary, it's a fairly good fan fiction at best or an insult to the long standing fans of the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Play-goers would exit the theatre happily excited by the goings-on but thinking more of the special effects than the writing.  i cant believe that a couple of kids would start out on such an adventure on such a flimsy premise - this part reads a bit like a 1950 Enid Blyton book.  I also have trouble with the stuffy Harry-speak.  He would never say Â«nor meÂ» (twice).  Its a tired old time travel plot but i will admit that even this Harry Potter book/script is better than no Harry Potter book.  I liked Scorpius, he was the only character in my opinion who actually had a personality.  I would have liked Albus more to the fore.

Morrison","Underwhelmed, but worth a read","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2016","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books (and movies) and revisit them often. I found this latest offering to be ""underwhelming"" to say the least.

I was intrigued with the notion of looking at the next generation of kids in Hogwarts as they faced new challenges and experiences.I think the idea of the principal characters' kids interacting in a fairly small world would open up a lot of cool interactions, [SPOILER] especially the idea of a Potter in Slytherin[ SPOILER]. Sadly, this play took the easy way out and just sort of threw a bunch of situations together reminiscent of the previous books and sprinkled in favorite characters here and there for the cheap emotional pop.

In the end, it feels like average fanfic. It reminds me a lot of the Star Wars books (Expanded Universe) that came out after Return of the Jedi... you know, where every book had the plot of the return of a super weapon and threat to whole universe. Sadly, what I liked about Harry Potter 1-7 is that even though there was one long threat (not 7 cloned ones), the real story was in the regular life happening as the story progressed.

This book/play flies through the story and gives little time for character development. The old characters are cardboard representatives of themselves and often behave out of context (especially poor Ron). The new characters have no depth. There are sprinklings of very shallow representations of Snape, Hagrid, and others

That said, this is a quick and easy read and it does feel good to read about favorite characters in a wonderful world again. I would like to see the play... perhaps with talented actors it will add some depth to it. What would I really like? A story about the next generation without Voldemort trying to return, with an emphasis on their lives in Hogwarts and new threats to face. I would read a lot of that!

I have to recommend this book to completists and say that it is not a waste of time., Just keep your expectations low and be ready for a lack of depth and some out-of-character issues.

For the most part. My only complaint is that the story in this screenplay is very disjointed from the HP series in that it simply does not fit. The main villain of the story is the love child of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange, who gave birth to this child right before the Battle of Hogwarts. This is highly unlikely as Voldemort as he has been described up to now would not have the desire to be with Bellatrix or any woman and she was not said or even remotely described as being pregnant when the trio were at Malfoy Manor in The Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately, this big twist and essential part of this storyline makes absolutely no sense and therefore the entire story unravels piece by piece when dissected even the slightest bit.

Having said that, if you were not a big Potterhead and just take the story as is without thinking too deeply into it, it is an enjoyable read and it was so very nice to have the trio together again. I would recommend this to any fan of Harry Potter and I will read it again, I was just a tad bit disappointed with this story and felt it could have been done much differently and more in keeping with the HP storyline.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_144?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=144&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I was most curious as to whether others felt the way I did about the book, and it appears most did.  For one, why just do a play?  If you're putting it out there and touting it as Book 8, why not just make a full fledged Book 8.  I was thrilled to be reading another Harry Potter, but the characters here were too one-dimensional, stiff and lacked complexity, as J.K. Rowling is more than capable of presenting.  I love reading her short stories on Pottermore as she explains more in-depth about her characters. However, on a more positive note, I enjoyed the storyline of the book and thought it was so apropros to have Harry and Draco's children becoming best friends, which presented a message here, albeit they came across as more juvenile at their ages then Harry and the others.  I agree with most reviewes, Harry was very out of character and it made it hard to believe his actions, as was Ron's character.  As much as I love the books and am truly a geek for Harry Potter, I don't think I would read another book like this one, or even attend a play about it at this point.  I was generous with the 3rd star--it was a solid 2½.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I loved the books- have read the series through multiple times. I've watched the movies many times... I love it all.

This story, however, did not  quite live  up to the rest of the series. I don't mind that it is written as a play- I majored in theatre. If anything, that was a part of the draw for me. What I minded was that is is written as a play without all of the marvelous detail and  backstory and intricasies and humor that made the books as magical and as wonderful as they are. It's as if this story counted on the  brilliance of Rowling's world to carry it, without contributing any of its own. The storyline is familiar, albeit told in a unique way, I failed to really connect with Albus, due to poor character development, and I felt disconnecfted to the new ""mopey Harry"".

In summary, this was a book that was a decent read,  but, forr me, failed to live up to all of the hype about it, or the world from which it came.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Here's a short list of points/criticism/things to consider.
1. This was not written by Rowling. It is essentially a fanfic IMHO.
2. Read this from the perspective that this is a screenplay, and knowing it simply doesnt translate from literature to screenplay. If you dont understand what I mean, read the screenplays of the other HP canon. You will see much is lost without the fullness of explanation.
3. There's an incredibly convoluted plot of time shifting, which in a HP book or heck even a HP movie would be explained better by reading in a book or watching in a theater.
4. The characters don't always act like themselves. For example, Snape would use Veritaserum to determine Scorpius' true motivations. There are other examples but they are apparent as you read along. That being said, some interactions are bang-on and well staged. It feels more legitimate, like Dumbledore's heartfelt interactions with Harry through his Hogwarts headmaster portraits.

All the minor inconsistencies, convoluted plot and lack of character development lead up to a read which is in the main rather disappointing. It touched on topics that were heartfelt, but the playwrights couldn't seem to decide if it was character driven or plot driven. Overall, it might make a passible play, if it was full of audience impact. An interactive experience counts for a lot in that medium, and might go a long way to help clear up the confusing scene changes and plot twists. However, the book as it stands does not adequately introduce its new characters and truly make you care about Albus or Rose. Moreover, the canon HP characters were sort of placed into the play as if we should just know them -- bad form, even if we do, because then you don't even care about the new world order under the Dark Lord.

In summary, this could have been done much better. Although I will reserve final judgement until I can see the play, for now I am merely saddened by the lack of attention to detail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I've pre-ordered six out of the seven books, watched all the movies, spied on fans over at the Mugglenet forum over the years, and enjoyed talking about the series with other people.

One-two months ago, I was looking forward to this script play. I didn't really mind that this play wasn't written by Jo, herself, at that time, because she still gave it her approval. Wanted to give this new writer a benefit of a doubt, because who knows? Then, it came out on stage, and I started to hear mixed (non-spoilerage) reviews. The media press seemed to have gushed out positive things on the stage version, but the non-media people --- namely, HP fans ---- easily gave it constructive criticism that made me alarmed.

Familiar fan-fic/story tropes like:
- A lot of OCs (with inconsistencies)
- Time traveling (which can either can be good or bad, depending on how it's done. It went okay in the Chamber of Secrets, but here?)
- The non-original characters not acting like themselves.
- Questionable plot details

So, I pretty much agreed with their thoughts that it sounded like a Harry Potter fan-fic on stage. As someone, who writes both original and fan-fic stories, I can tell when story-telling goes awry. Especially, if you added in a ton of OCs, who you're not familiar with.

On top of this, this reminded me of Jo's last written HP book. Book 7's epilogue ending left a bitter taste in my moutb, because it felt like a fan-fic compared to the rest of the entire series. When a set of characters, you've grown to love, have an instant time skip and suddenly have kids....  It did feel a little cheesy, but I'm glad the film adaptation pulled it off better.

So, going back to Cursed Child... I pretty much held off buying this book, because of the mixed stage reception. As of today, July 31st, I've officially made my decision not to purchase the play thanks to a lot of reader reviews over here. I waited past midnight, and this morning, just to see everyone's reactions. I expected the reviews to be as mixed and polarized as it is. I still didn't even see the actual major spoilers,  but the general gist from what I'm getting out of your reviews...

To add to the list:

- Clichés
- Deus ex machina - The awful crux of storytelling. Used only as a plot convenience to end something quickly.
- Mary/Gary Sue - Depending on how it's written, I can sometimes be ok with these, but guess in this situation, it's not so nice.
- A lot of plot holes. Even for a stage play, you shouldn't really have these (or more than two) to have a good story. I've seen numerous Broadway, off-Broadway and non-musical stage plays. I never thought of ""plot holes"" in any of them. Even the ambiguous ""Waiting for Godot"" is done that way for a reason, so I don't think of ""plot hole"" within its playwright.
- Where's Harry Potter? All next gen kids, so, the name feels mis-leading on the non-originals taking a back seat. (Somewhat subjective, but understandable.)
- Didn't add anything too new or it's boring. (Likewise, all subjective statements.)

Understandably, there is suppose to be a novel updated version next year written up by Jo. So, I may look out for that, but I just can't get Book 7's epilogue off my mind. I live near NYC, but I'm not going to bat an eye for Cursed Child when it comes here. The up-coming ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" definitely looks good, and will super look forward to it.

I wish I can give a non-star neutral post, as someone who didn't buy the book so it may come off as an unfair review, but I felt compelled enough to write this as a concerned HP reader. Three out of five stars feel justified to make it neutral. If I really read it, I know I'll give it either a one or two stars rating.

So, even with Jo's involvement, I'm very much surprised that she allowed her baby to be touched by someone else. The movies were one thing. A new stage play that is said to be canon? I still recall the distant past when Jo had issues with HP fan-fiction.

Just the fundamental story writing no nos, alone, make the disappointment feel like I've seen it already. You can make the story very flashy and have energetic characters with various personalities, but when you have story + character inconsistencies visible enough on stage, you are seriously missing the heart of everything you loved about the original author's writing. :(

My only advice to others, should you come this far, is buy or rent/borrow the physical book. If you like it, that's fine, but if not, at least, you can get your money back if bought.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews","6 people found this helpful"

There were problems. For instance, who exactly was this written for? People who read Harry Potter as a kid and liked it but don't remember it very well? Newcomers to Harry Potter will be confused due to the amount of required prior knowledge, while hardcore fans will be frustrated by the numerous plot holes and inconsistencies that other reviewers have already listed in depth. And I do feel like the play formatting hurt it as a reading experience. Without the visuals of a live performance or the detailed description of a novel, the more action filled and magical parts fell a bit flat. I was aware of what I was missing and it didn't fully come alive. The original books were average length to quite long, whatever it took to tell the story properly, while the Cursed Child was often choppy and abrupt. I was constantly aware of the time constraints inherent to making a play while reading it. I knew what I was buying and I'm cool with the idea of there being a play, but I think I'd be happier if they'd also put together a novel or even a novella and sold me that instead of the script. Some people will happily eat up anything Harry Potter and some people are really into theater, but I feel like it's a lot to ask of your audience to suddenly be cool with a huge time gap and a bunch of new characters and then add on a completely different style and formatting as well. Of the new characters, I liked Scorpius but was unimpressed with the villain of the piece. The dialogue sometimes felt forced and there were also moments when the boys just didn't sound their age at all.  So yeah...that' a fair bit of negative, but again, I did enjoy it alright. If you're a Harry Potter fan you should probably go ahead and satisfy your curiosity, just don't get your hopes too high.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

I also just finished the entire series (again)  to prepare for this book. I KNEW it would be a play, so it would be a little different. I tried not to go into the book with any expectations other than being excited to return to the Wizarding World, which was exciting enough. And it was... underwhelming. The beauty of HP and of JK is her ability to craft these amazing, complex, insightful, in depth characters with an intricate plot, which sucks you into their world. And because the formatting was a play, it was hard to be really immersed into the world and into the characters as in the original books. It all felt rushed and everyone felt underdeveloped, especially the new characters. I loved the friendship of Albus and Scorpious but it was also a bit flat and some of their character development was lost in the writing (or really lack there of)  JK Rowling is my favorite author, so I guess I missed the details of her writing through this format. Luna, Neville or Hagrid do not make an appearance through the book, boo! The ability to connect with the characters and really love them/ or even hate them in the original books is what made them so...magical. So, the book was okay, NOTHING compared to the original story where you really connected with the characters. I do hope the JK Rowling returns to Harry Potter, maybe the year after the battle when Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their last year and how the battle impacted them all afterward. Love you JK Rowling and I hope you keep writing in the magical world, a full book would be great next time, because of course, I will always love Harry Potter.

Berg","Hmmm,did I just read a faux HP book?","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","Ok, everyone's pretty well covered what's right or wrong already. I agree, Rowling should've been the only author IF this was a novel. It's not, it's a script for what I imagine is a great play.  I hope she will decide to do a novelization because we would then get a full blown characterization of these people we've known and want to know better(i.e. The kids). Ron would've never been a magic/joke/trick store owner unless he took over the wands store or worked in the dept of magic development program for devices or such. I see Ginny as second in command in the ministry and I'm not being a feminist here, I'm simply seeing the strengths the women had in the original 7. I do see HP working through PTSD but c'mon he  comes across as a real whiner here!
I found the beginning and end better written and the middle section frustrating and just filler. It gets 3 stars because, face it, we got another HP book. Almost a 4 until that middle section bored me. It took me less than 4 hours to read so that was good- but that wasn't so good until I remembered, it's a script.

It's hard to connect with new characters, and the old ones never feel like they're written quite right. The plot has flaws, but it's still a decent story that I think any Potter fan will want to read. It's also a very quick read, easy to knock out in a day or two even for a slow reader like me.

As a lifelong Harry Potter fan (yep, I went to premieres, read the books a bunch of times, etc. Especially in my teen years, I was obsessed with the books. They easily shaped me into the person I am today), I was thrilled to hear about the publishing of this play. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd ever give anything with Rowling's name stamped onto the cover less than five stars. But, here I am. I did like the Cursed Child, but I didn't love it. After reading spoilers, I was skeptical going in. I think my expectations, while low, were met. The story itself was okay, but I was still disappointed at how much was left out and missed the magic that I felt whenever I read the other Potter books.

This review will probably be all over the place. As much as I hate to admit it, I do agree with the general critique that this play reads like fanfiction. For me, it's clear that Rowling did not actually write it. I thought the ending had a bit of her voice in it, but otherwise, it all read as if it were a story written by a teenage fan. The characters that I've grown up with did not sound like themselves. I realize that they would have aged by this point, but the dialogue still felt very forced. The trio, especially, was off. It wasn't terrible to the point where I immediately noticed it, but as the story went on, I constantly felt myself questioning how well I remembered them. I would stop and think, ""That doesn't sound like something Hermione would say... Or am I just not remembering her tone well enough?"" There were many subtle out of character moments.

To elaborate a little further, Harry Potter's character was completely off. I couldn't stand how the writers changed him. He turned into an angry, rude prick. Sure, the angsty fifth year Harry Potter might have yelled at Dumbledore, but I cannot imagine Harry as a full grown adult treating his elders  as he did here. His parenting was also just awful. Sure, he didn't have a father growing up, but he had plenty of father figures. At one point in the play, Harry says this:

""Most people at least have a dad to base themselves on--and either try to be or try not to be. I've got nothing--or very little. So I'm learning, okay?"" (306)

I wanted to throw my book across the room and never pick it up again. I understand that James wasn't present in Harry's life, but he still had plenty of father figures to learn from. What about Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Hagrid, and even Arthur? I'd call those people father figures. To say Harry didn't learn anything from them is a pure insult to their characters. It made me so upset.

Hermione and Ron didn't feel like themselves, either. Hermione was present, but not as witty and intelligent as before. Ron turned into a sitcom dad. He was reduced to dumb jokes and felt so out of character (he sounded more like a George Weasley knock-off than anything). There were also so many great characters left out. Obviously there's only so much time in a play, and to acknowledge every single character from the series would be impossible, but I still expected some of the important ones to appear. Where was Hagrid? Luna? George? The list goes on. I was especially annoyed that Teddy Lupin didn't appear, because the epilogue of book seven made it seem as if Teddy had been heavily involved in both the Potter and Weasley households.

The children were actually okay. I loved Scorpius. He was fantastic. Albus was fine, as well. However, I couldn't quite get over the fact that he was so quickly abandoned and bullied at Hogwarts. I've been on Post Potter roleplay forums. There are Weasleys EVERYWHERE. I find it difficult to believe that Albus wouldn't have had some familial support. I don't care which House he's sorted into-- there's no way that someone wouldn't have reached out to him (over and over again at that, if he didn't respond initially). I also find it hard to believe that James was such a douche to him. James Sirius, Lily Luna, Hugo, and many other children didn't appear much in the play. It felt weird without them. Given the plot, they definitely should have been around more.

Character rants aside, the plot wasn't actually as bad as I had thought, after reading spoilers. It all somehow worked, with the exception of a few scenes. However, it was way too fast paced for a play. There was no down time. We didn't get to see the daily lives of the kids at Hogwarts or any of the magic of that world. The Potter books were always great, because they had drama, but also slower parts where we got to see the kids attempt to be kids. That didn't happen in this play. They tried to put in some comedic relief, but all of it was silly and out of place (it felt like a 90s sitcom).

While I do believe that the plot WORKED, it still felt unnecessary. I don't understand why the play had to go back in time. We've read the books before-- we know what happens. Going back was a nice trip down memory lane, but it was still cheap. I wanted to expand on the Wizarding World, not relive it (don't get me started on how THE ONLY JOBS that they acknowledged in this play were Quidditch and jobs at the Ministry. They referenced them so many times). Going back in time didn't hurt my image of the series, luckily, but it didn't bring anything new into it, either.

I could go on forever about my feelings about this play. I think a big problem with it is that it is just a play. I enjoy reading plays (I was a theatre kid growing up) and I'm sure this was awesome to see live. Reading it just condensed the plot into something that wasn't as deep and wonderful as the other Harry Potter literature. Also, I missed Rowling's voice so much. If she had written this story as an actual novel, I think it might actually have been pretty good. The plot, while a little far-fetched, would be so much better if it was just expanded upon.

In the end, this wasn't terrible. I should probably rate it two stars, but I'll leave it at three. There were some beautiful moments in this mess. I liked going back into the Wizarding World, but I still think it was unnecessary. This whole thing felt like a cheap attempt to bring back in fans. For me, it didn't work. There were many plot holes. Even the writers seemed to know that they were there, because every time a really obvious one came to mind, they literally addressed it in the script. But even their explanations fell flat. The play got better as it went on, but there were a lot of weird, out of character parts. I liked Albus and Scorpius. I wish we had gotten a true eighth story, about their adventures with the rest of their family members.

Sort Of.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","I fell in love with the book immediately... In the sense that nostalgia flooded back to me, desperately looking for the feeling of reading a brand new Harry Potter book again-- for the first time in 9 years.
When you get further in the book, however, you realize how much is missing. After all, it's written as a script. No descriptive paragraphs, no narration of Harry's inner thoughts.... Just dialogue. That loses a lot.
For years I have wondered how Jo would write another book. Would it be about Harry's kids? Harry's Parents? Random wizards? I personally think it would be difficult to grip the audience without the unique situation of Harry and Voldemort. My thoughts were confirmed by the direction of The Cursed Child. SPOILER---- the use of time-travel to characters and events from the original 7 Harry Potter books was a huge crutch to the imagination for the wizarding world. Most of the book was a ""throwback"".
I think it was painfully clear JKR was not the main author. From the way each character spoke, to the entire plot. It seemed like fan fiction. It was rushed, not extremely substantive, many things go unexplained.

I enjoyed getting a hint of the world I knew and loved as a kid.

I also read that the play itself had a lot of slight of hand as an interpretation of the magic.  Instead of imagining the world of Harry Potter to be super deep and realistic, I could only see a cheesy play.  I know it's incredibly difficult to get as deep as the novels when we are only reading dialogue and stage directions and maybe I would feel more enthusiastic if I were watching the play on the stage.  I felt the characters were off and the emotions I was meant to feel, I couldn't.  It was hard to connect and I think there was a lot of back story that would've made this more believable.  I don't think it's the worst idea to have a book about returning to the past, but I see two major issues with this story.

1. Slytherin is often thought of as the evil house, but is supposed to contain wizards with great leadership skills.  This tends to be why we see people like Snape and Draco being kind of power-driven. Snape is on a power trip in his classroom and Draco walks around like he owns the place with his goonies. The qualities they possess can also be shown as positive and Albus and Scorpius had a chance to show fans that Slytherin House occupants are also kind leaders.  I feel a great opportunity was missed.

2. How does Delphi come up with the conclusion that saving Cedric would change the world? And I have trouble believing that Cedric could ever become a death eater, no matter how embarrassed he may be.  I understand the idea behind linking ""the spare,"" but still find this to be very unbelievable.

I think a lot more could've been done to bring Harry and his son closer together.  I think the Pensieve could've been used to help Albus understand his father by seeing more of him and achieving that flash back idea that connects the old plots with the new one.

I honestly think a movie would offer a better level of realism and stronger connection with the characters.  I think the lines of the main characters from the books we loved could be tweaked, but I think it really has more to do with delivery and that's hard to grasp from just a script.  As Potter fans we are used to depth, grand scenery, and strong characters.  This format doesn't give the same effect. I would love to see this as a novel written only by Rowling and maybe a move adaptation along the way.

I wouldn't have chosen this direction with the plot, but since Rowling has made this the 8th official book, I really hope a novel follows up to save this story from losing the feeling of the characters.

There is a lot I could say about this book. For starters, it is not the 8th book. Please, please stop calling it that. That's pretty much saying that any popular HP fan fiction could be classified as a plausible book in the series. They aren't. Some are amazing! But they are NOT books in HP.
I don't appreciate that they didn't do proper character study when approaching this. Too many personalities changed too much. Before anyone starts on the whole ""19 years later"" thing I KNOW! But that doesn't excuse the portrayal of everyone. Just because something is years into the future doesn't mean that the initial characters should be changed that drastically!
The best thing you can do is to separate this book from the HP series and you may be able to appreciate it for that. Think of it more like a bizarre AU. So much of this play doesn't quite add up with what we HP fans already know about the world.

That being said, I didn't hate it but I clearly didn't love it either. I can appreciate what they have done and the fact that they brought something inspired by HP to life on stage! It's impressive! I wish I could actually see the play. Reading stage directions in a book is one thing but being able to see it is another. I love plays. Maybe it would improve my overall opinion of this book.

Look, I understand why it's being heralded as the 8th book. I get why it is a hit. I get why it's praised so highly. Yet for me, I cannot get over the inconsistencies. I wanted to love this book! I wanted to heap joyous proclamations of it's existence to anyone who would listen! I wanted to do these things! But this script has failed me. It simply doesn't give me enough to love and praise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

But be prepared for the format and lack of satisfying writing","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","This is, of course, a must-read for anyone who loved the Harry Potter stories.  That said, it's clearly NOT written by JK Rowling.  And, being formatted as a screenplay, it misses SO much of the satisfying detail of the original seven books.  The amazing wordplay is totally lacking.  Often, the words and phrases of characters we know and love seem.... foreign.  So many times, I found myself saying.... there is no way he (she) would have actually said that.

For the first 1/3 or so of the 'book'.... I actually hated it.  I almost quit reading it, which of course NEVER happened in any other book of the series.  However, after your mind accepts the bare-bones format, and accepts that you won't get the satisfying writing and word play.....  the story is good.  It's convoluted and complicated, and really, at some level, pretty satisfying.  It does feel like it could have been a continuation of the story.  I found some major flaws in the story (like.... that could NOT have happened... didn't they consider the limitations of....... kind of thing).  But, overall, I'm glad I read it and enjoyed it.

I would have MUCH rather waited longer and gotten a REAL story from JK Rowling herself.  But, I'd still suggest reading this if you loved the Harry Potter books.  Just... prepare yourself for superficial - something you've never gotten from Rowling before.","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","3 people found this helpful"

There isnt sufficient effort given to develop the character, to explain the situations or circumstances which form Albus Severus's personality.

My rating? I'm giving it about 2-1/2 stars out of 4. The story picks up exactly where ""Deathly Hallows"" leave off, on the platform by the Hogwarts Express. The play revolves almost entirely around Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. A good deal of the storyline takes a look at the estrangement between Harry and Albus, and that of Draco and Scorpius. Both of the boys are lonely, losers, and burdened with the legacy of their famous fathers, especially Albus. There is a convoluted time travel plot that weaves throughout, and a new villain who I had figured out by the second act, although the exact identity of who this person is remained a mystery until the fourth act.

I am perfectly conscious of the fact that this is play, not a novel, but my overall impression is that it is simplistic, one of shallowness and an almost juvenile plot. That is not necessarily a bad thing. After all, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" are essentially kids' books and the story doesn't start getting really dark until ""Azkaban."" The main characters are, after all, young teenagers. However, all of the adults in the story are almost shadows or parodies of their former selves. They mainly wander through the scenes with nothing much to do, or agonize over their parenting skills (which suck, IMHO). There are WAY WAY WAY too many ""cameos"" by past characters, again who seem to put in an appearance simply to satisfy the fans. It drags down the story. My take on the plot is that it's not very well written fanfic. A good editor would have cleaned this mess up. In fact, if the story had been submitted to one of my fanzines, I probably would have rejected it.

As for the structure of the play itself, it seems to consist of two minute scenes that contain a few snippets of dialogue, some special effects, and frantic background changes. There are so many changes of location (presumably with scenery and set dressing), that I cannot fathom what it must have cost the play's producers in backgrounds alone. Of course, I have not seen the play, so I am only going on reading of the script to imagine this. The play is divided into two separate productions, each two acts long. IMHO, it could have been rewritten as one 3-1/2 hour or so play and smoothed out a lot.

 And one final comment about the play. There is one major question that remains unanswered after all is said and done -- who exactly is the Cursed Child? Albus Potter? Scorpius Malfoy? The new villain with the shocking and evil background? I suppose it's up to us to decide.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Not Bad","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2016","Well, it's more of the same, but written to be performed as a 3 hour play, so there is a lot less of it. The character chemistry was really the highlight of HPATCC. I found the characters afinity (or antipathy) to be surprisingly palpable and both of our two new young heroes, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, are quite engaging in their own right. The plot is servicable if a bit same-y. The only real failing - and I can not overstate the magnitude of failure here - is that despite ostensibly revolving around the misadventures Albus and Scorpius, the story is never really theirs. Rather than being given their own 20-years-later version of the Potterverse to pluckily fumble about in, they are cordially invited to join our other Potter favorites in their world, under the strict guidelines that no matter how much stage time they get, Harry is the star. Some element actually feel like a late season TV clip show, with the characers emotionally retreading their pasts, pasts that we have already experienced with them. Some fans may be interested in the day-to-day domestic trials of the Boy Who Lived, or in revisiting the 80s and 90s with the HP gang, but I am not that fan; and with all the untapped potential energy of Albus, Scorpius, and Rose Granger-Weasley, I feel like HPATCC is a missed opportunity.  I would not go so far as to recommend against reading HPATCC, but as HP canon goes, it is a cutesy, disposable light read, and nothing more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It is with some regret that I must admit that this play, written as such, is full of disappointment in many ways. As a student of dramatic writing, I was excited to see the world I loved be set forth under the intimacy and the magic that the drama form allows. Regretfully, I found the Cursed Child to be repetitive and empty in its plot construction. Much of the characters seemed to be shadows of their book selves, or just a beat off of who I knew them to be. Much of the action and spectacle of the play relies on the audiences ability to see it live and preformed which, especially in my opinion, shouldn't be necessary to the enjoyment of the play as a whole. I enjoyed reading the play simply for the thrill of seeing these familiar names once again on new pages, and appreciated a lot of the information given about Albus Potter, and the fates of the next generation. I suggest fans give it read with a guarded mind; this isn't the work of our plot-master JK Rowling, or even the characters as we know them best, but it is a reminder of the beloved past, and will satisfy the longing- if only until Fantastic Beasts comes out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

I would like to note that while the Harry Potter books are aimed at young adult readers (and are one of the standards to which I hold writers for that age group), I doubt that the kids would appreciate the screenplay style. I found it dulling.

My Take
The cover claims that this is ""based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling"", and I wish there had been an actual new story that had been adapted into a screenplay. I suspect that Rowling merely gave them the outline with which to write this screenplay.

That said, the basis of the story is that of the son having to follow in his father's footsteps…and feeling totally inadequate. And poor Harry, well, he's a typical dad who doesn't know how to cope. As for that Act Four, Scene Four bit, I can understand Harry's thoughts, but it's not written very well.

The basics of this screenplay run along the Harry Potter lines, but it lacks the emotionally descriptive writing of the Rowling style. If you must read it, I suggest borrowing the book and deciding if you want to spend the money. I appreciate having read it, if only to see how Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and the rest are doing these eighteen years later, but I did not enjoy the formatting style.

I did enjoy the joking about. There's one instance with Ron bragging about having passed his Muggle driving test that took me right back. As for St. Oswald's, it does sound like a lot of fun, lol. I also appreciated the praise Harry heaps on Professor Snape. As for Scorpius' idea of love ""growing"", oh, boy…*she says in laughter*…

I do not like the sound of Rose. I'd've thought Ron and Hermione would have raised her better. As for Harry, I'd would've thought he'd be more empathetic about Scorpius' problems. Instead he's become the Establishment. Thankfully, it's a façade that crumbles at the end.

There's some back history such as what Aunt Petunia tells Harry about his parents and a reprise of Lily, James, and Harry's encounter with Voldemort.

The story races, and I do mean races, as we're already up to year two at Hogwarts by page 22 with the previous pages having set up Albus' initial conflict and issues and by page 26 we're in year three in which the kick-off, the turning point of the whole story, begins with Albus angry with his father's dismissal of Amos Diggory's plea.

A minor conflict in the story, well, minor to Albus anyway, is the stirrings in the Dark, as Voldemort's allies are stirring, writhing, threatening.

The moral of the story is DON'T mess about with time and is a terrifying look at what the alternatives could have been.
""Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.""
The Story
Young Albus can't decide if he's excited or terrified about going off to Hogwarts for the first time, for in the time-honored tradition of siblings, young James has been filling his head with terrifying possibilities. Especially with the possibility that Albus will end up in Slytherin!!
""…the unseen child who will kill his father…""
The Characters
The thirty-seven-year-old Harry Potter, the head of Magical Law Enforcement, is married to Ginny Weasley (she edits the Daily Prophet sports page), and they have three children: James, Albus Severus, and Lily. James and Lily Potter were our Harry's parents.

Ron Weasley (he runs the Weasley joke shop) and Hermione Granger, the current Minister for Magic, are married with a daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley. Ethel is Hermione's secretary.

Draco Malfoy, a Death Eater, is married to Astoria. Their son is Scorpius who lives under a dread cloud.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is…
…a boarding school for young wizards and witches with four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Students travel to the school aboard the Hogwarts Express, the special wizarding train which leaves from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. The Trolley Witch is there selling her tasties — and it turns out she's quite a bit more than we'd ever believed. Ottaline Gambol had something to do with the beginning of the Hogwarts Express.

I think Professor McGonagall is the current headmistress. Madam Hooch is still teaching flying. Neville Longbottom is the botany professor. Madam Pomfrey still reigns in the medical wing. Rubeus Hagrid had been the Keeper of Keys and Grounds. Albus Dumbledore had been the headmaster.

Slytherin House is…
…a house of Dark wizards with a snake as its mascot. The one from which Voldemort rose and into which Albus and Scorpius are sorted.

Gryffindor House is…
…a house of champions and had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione's own house and into which James was placed. Its mascot is a lion. Rose will become the new Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

Other students include Polly Chapman who is a right berk, Karl Jenkins, Yann Fredericks, and the fated Craig Bowker, Jr., who is intimidated in alternate timelines.

Hogsmeade is…
…a village the students may visit once they're in their third year. Honeydukes is the sweet shop in the village for which I need to win the lottery.

Bane is a centaur in the forest around Hogwarts. Moaning Myrtle, a.k.a., Myrtle Elizabeth Warren, is the ghost in the bathroom. Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric's Hollow.

Amos Diggory is now wheelchair-bound and living at St. Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards. His son, Cedric, was killed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , 4. Delphini ""The Auguery"" Diggory is Amos' niece who works as a nurse at the Home. Ludo Bagman had been in charge of the Triwizard Tournament in which Viktor ""Krazy Krum"" had represented Durmstrang, another school for magic. Cornelius Fudge had been the Minister for Magic back in the day.

In Alternate Timelines…
…as Albus pursues his goal…Aunt Padma is married to Ron, and their son is Padmu. Albus is in Gryffindor. The mean Professor Hermione Granger suffers her choices. Professor Dolores Umbridge is headmistress ( Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , 5). Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom are dead. Scorpius is quite popular as the Scorpion King, and his dad is the head of Magical Law Enforcement. Professor Snape is still alive. Cedric is still alive, but not in a good way.

Voldemort, the Dark Lord, a.k.a., Tom Riddle, was the evil wizard who was finally defeated in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , 7. Nagini had been Voldemort's snake. Theodore Nott and Euphemia Rowle and her family had been Death Eaters, some of Voldemort's followers. Dumbledore's Army had been the group of students and adults who had fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

The Dursleys were a Muggle family who had to take Harry in when he was orphaned. Aunt Petunia had been sister to Lily Potter (Harry's mum) and married to Uncle Vernon. Cousin Dudley seems to have turned into a nicer guy.

A Time-Turner allows you to travel through time. Professor Croaker's law is all about time, and sounds as if it operates in a manner similar to Moore's Law combined with the butterfly effect. Mudbloods is a pejorative for Muggles, regular humans. An Augurey is a sinister-looking black bird that is believed to foretell death.

The Cover and Title
The cover is a linear gradation of golden yellows with a below-middle graphic of young Albus in his winged nest, flying off into his own adventures. All the text is embossed in a deep brown, and the three-dimensional title is at the top with the authors listed below along with the ""warnings"" about ""based"" and being ""a new play"".

The title is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, but the question is which child is the cursed one?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

First off, I enjoyed reading it as a play without having seen the play yet. I liked visualizing it as I read and trying to imagine how they were going to put it together. Overall on that front I actually liked the idea of a script book.
However the storyline didn't hit me as a good ""official"" continuation to the Harry Potter story. It struck me as more like a fan fiction that had fantastical uncharacteristic plot twists that are entertaining but not what you would expect from the author, whether she had much to do with writing it at all. I've seen other reviews that state the same as well.
Was it worth the read? For me yes, because I do like fantastical fan fiction-esque like stories. But to the die hard Harry Potter fan inside of me, I cannot consider or except this as the true Harry Potter continuation.

Like so many others, I was excited to travel back into the world of Harry Potter. After devouring the other books, I felt the famine of nothing new for years and years. I was ready for any tiny morsel I could get. However, this book did not satisfy the hunger.

To be honest, this read more like a fan fiction written by a casual reader who did not know the ins and outs of the books. There were many things that did not match with the original stories and many things that simply were left unexplained. I understand that this is a play and so, by nature, it could not go into the extraordinary details that the books themselves could. However, when they flat out change things (like how polyjuice is made) just to make the plot work, it seems lazy. And it is hard not to be angry about a book that completely destroys the character’s character. Without spoiling anything, know that there are a few characters that they will try to make you see in a completely different light, and it is not appreciated.

My complaints aside, it was nice to visit with the Potters and Weasleys again. But I think I could have gotten the same from a quick internet search. Maybe JK Rowlings will one day treat us to an actual book with a fully thought out story, until then I guess we are stuck accepting whatever we can get.

There are two important things to note about this book: 1) It's a stage play script, not a novel. 2) It wasn't written by J.K. Rowling. The first point is important because the 308 pages of this book make for a very quick read. Lines are widely spaced and descriptions narrative descriptions are minimal. The second point is important because, though it may have Rowling's name on the cover, this book reads more like fan fiction than a real sequel. Yes, it's rubber stamped as the official next chapter of the franchise but in truth it feels entirely unlike any of Rowling's own writing in both style and substance. There are multiple plot points that feel completely disconnected and out of place from the rest of the series and it makes the whole story hard to accept as cannon regardless of what Rowling says. The short stories released on Pottermore in support of the Fantastic Beasts films feel far more genuine as part of the world of Harry Potter. That said, it was a fun read that gives a long awaited look into the post-Voldemort world and in the grander scheme I suspect it will serve as little more than an awkward middle chapter leading to a Rowling-penned sequel series that we're all still waiting for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Yes. Is this the 8th harry potter book? Absolutely not.

If youre a fan of harry potter then by all means buy the script, but adjust your expectations. This is not a novelization of JK rowlings story, this is just the script of the London play. Its a fun story, but frankly this is not a hp book or even close to their quality level. It reads a lot more like high grade fanfic then a rowling novel (which since she didnt write it the script basically is). For me, the emotionally powerful moments (and there are too few) were mostly powerful only because they include characters we already know and love (there may have been a few man tears tossed in there). And

The emotionally powerful moments end up having little consequence on the overarching story. Still tear jerkers to be sure, but nothing permanent (i.e. Fred's death).

So I am biased to really love this book. But I found it ""OK"". I guess I liked it. I recommend it if you are an HP fan too. But, if this is your introduction to the magical world of Harry Potter, I doubt you would go back for more. Maybe I have just been spoiled all of these years by the sheer awesomeness that is JKR's writing. This is just not that caliber.

The story is concept is good - just good. Not as well thought out as the series, but still good. And I admit I relished all of the new information about characters that have been a part of my life for so long - that they feel like family. But unfortunately, in Cursed Child, I didn't bond with a single character - not even the ones I have loved forever. And the only one of them that showed any of the emotional growth that I would expected after 19 years was Draco.

I didn't find the writing style as good as I expected either. I know it is a screenplay and written differently than a book and maybe part of the problem. Cursed Child just doesn't have the level of detail and seems less of a story and more of an 'Everyone-Feeling-Sorry-For-Themselves-Whine-In"".

Hummm, maybe that's it.... A lot of the characters in the Harry Potter series had a hard time, and the books were sometimes very dark, but as a rule it was a positive - even magical (yes I used that word...) story.  It was a world that I could see myself wanting to be in.  I don't feel that with  this book. I am glad I read it. But unlike the Harry Potter series, which I have read so many times that I think it is permanently imprinted on my eyeballs, reading Cursed Child once is enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The play is probably highly entertaining and some of the effects described in the screenplay are probably pretty cool.  I would be interested to see how the some of the magic was done onstage.  And if you read it expecting the detail that is contained in the books, you will be disappointed.

As for the story, I have mixed feelings.  I am a huge fan of the original books and I thought the ending of the Deathly Hallows was done perfectly, and the series itself was amazing, so I would be perfectly happy if everything ended right there.  However, I don't have an issue with the story continuing and it is quite interesting to see what the characters are doing later in life.  However, I would have preferred that the original story be left alone and not tampered with, which is not the case.

In writing this, I will try to describe the story as best I can without giving away too much.  The story starts the way the epilogue in the Deathly Hallows ends with Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione sending their kids off on the Hogwarts Express.  Harry's youngest son, Albus, is going to Hogwarts for the first time and is very worried.  On the train, Albus meets Scorpius Malfoy and the two become friends.  Both are outcasts, Albus living in the shadow of his famous father and Scorpius because he is rumored to be not Draco's real son, but the son of Lord Voldemort.  Albus resents his father and Harry has a difficult time in handling Albus.  The two don't get along.  Harry makes some efforts, but they fall flat, Albus drifts further away and Harry then says some things that make it even worse.
With this strained relationship as the basis for the plot, Albus decides to take some action to right what he feels is one of his father's wrongs from the past.  From there, chaos ensues.  I will leave it at that to avoid any spoilers.
If you are a Harry Potter fan, you obviously have to read this.  How much you like it depends on your perspective.  I'm sure there are fans out there that just want to see the story continue and will really like this book.  If you are like me, however, and you feel the original story should be left alone, you may have some issues with this.
If you have not read the original books, you will probably need to before reading this or much of it will not make much sense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

Perhaps this plays better on stage, but I found a lot of the characters and their actions to be pretty flat.  These characters are not written particularly well.  It might have worked if we didn't already have a very extensive background for each of these characters, making this iteration of them forced and hollow.  As I know a few others here have already stated, this reads a lot like a fan fiction, and not necessarily a good one.

First of all, Albus and Scorpius do not sound like kids.  There's a lot of time with them expounding on what  great friends they are.  They state it aloud a great deal,  hug each other, have a lot of emotional moments, talk about their feelings, etc,  For me, this came across pretty forced. It might have worked slightly better had they been girls, but even then it would have been forced and odd.  It was not necessary for Ron, Harry, and Hermione to be stating constantly, ""You're my best friend"" for the audience and/or the reader to know how they felt about each other.  Their interactions made it obvious on a continuous basis.  Here, I get that the author is trying to make certain the audience gets that Scorpius and Albus are devoted friends because they keep hitting us over the head with it.  They must be best friends because they keep telling us (and each other) CONSTANTLY. They're friends.  We get it.  Move on.

Albus is actually pretty annoying.  Harry and others keep saying, ""Well he's a teenager"" (as he is in a large portion of the story), but even at Harry's most emotional, growing pains moments (Book 5, Order of the Phoenix, the iteration I like to refer to as CAPSLOCK Harry because he yells...a lot), he is not this obnoxious or annoying.  It would be less irritating if Albus' issue was something concrete.  This is hard to do, I know, when Harry's character faced nothing less than the defeat of the most evil wizard of all time, and the possible destruction of the wizarding world every year.

But Albus' main issue?  He's dark and sullen because he thinks it's such a pain to have a famous father.  When his situation becomes more serious, it's of his own choosing, not because he is thrust into a situation and has to dig deep within himself to face things.  I did not really take to his character at all.  His sullenness was simply annoying (as there was little basis for it), and his ""I'm dark and moody"" persona just seemed very forced.  The other kids seem well adjusted enough.  Albus just comes across like a spoiled child.  There's no real reason to sympathize with the character - he's just obnoxious.  Having a famous father is not the huge problem Albus is making it out to be.

Speaking of forced, Ginny, Ron, and even Hermione to an extent are cardboard figures.  Granted their characters have a few amusing moments here and there (hence the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2), but they do not come across as developed, and considering the original stories gave a relatively extensive background for these characters to draw from, that's pretty disappointing.  Hermione is bossy.  Ron is a putz.  Dumbledore, who makes a cameo of sorts, is distraught (seriously, there is absolutely zero of the charm that the Dumbledore character usually has displayed here - just a lot of over the top weeping and drama).

Strangely enough, of the ""main"" characters involved here, Ginny seems to get the best treatment.  Her character is the wise oracle that has all the meaningful things to say to soothe everyone else.  For a moment, I had to double check to see if the story wasn't called ""Ginny Potter and the Cursed Child"".

And then there's Harry.  Oh my god, what they've done to Harry.  Harry spends a great deal of time in high angst.  He's EXTREMELY emotional, and indecisive, which was an odd choice for the author to make considering  Harry is now an Auror, an occupation that does not have room for a lot of hand-wringing and blubbering.  For seven books, the Harry character faced danger and the problems of being constantly in the spotlight, and he did not crumple as much as he does here.  Here, he is reduced to a whiny, ""Oh-my-God-Ginny-tell-me-what-to-do"" kind of guy.  He is Angst-y with a capital ""A"".  Did this author read the books?  This is what he thought Harry would become as a result of the events of his earlier life?  Are we to believe Harry has been reduced to an overly emotional, empty shell of a man?  Seriously?  This story would have us believe that post Hogwarts Harry has become delicate and damaged.  Sorry, I don't buy it.

The actual story-line has some intriguing moments, and could have been far more interesting if it had been handled in a better manner.  If you'll pardon the pun, there is little of the ""magic"" of the wizarding world displayed here.  There's no wonder.

*MINOR SPOILERS*

When it was decided that Albus would be in Slytherin, I thought they were going to go somewhere with that, but no.  There was a bunch of ""A Potter in Slytherin?""  but that was essentially it.  There wasn't much expansion as to why Albus ended up in Slytherin when everyone else in the extended Potter family was in Gryffindor.  They could have done a lot with that, but ...no.

Hermione being the Minister of Magic was a fun situation, I thought.  Given the character's past personality (and her magical skills) I thought it would only be a matter of time before she became Minister.  There seemed to be a difficult time translating her to the stage here though.  Yes, Hermione is bossy and very driven, but she was always uber-focused because she wanted to learn everything.  She wasn't bossy for the sake of being bossy, and because she enjoyed being in charge of everyone.  She craved knowledge.  I don't get that from this Hermione.

And Ron.  They simply didn't know what to do with Ron.  He is now the easy-going prankster who works with his brother George.  He seems to have been given a joking type of personality, much like Fred would have had.  I found that to be an odd choice because the Ron character spends much of the books trying to determine who he is in a family of over-achieving older siblings.  He didn't have this joke-y type of personality before.  It just seems odd that the choice was made to morph him into a Fred replacement.

As an aside...although we don't see a great deal of him, Draco has a few interesting moments here.  He, also, is a little angst-y for my tastes, but I thought it worked for he and the trio's kids to not have interaction that was automatically negative.

*END SPOILERS*

I honestly think the story had some interesting plot possibilities.  It simply was not handled very well.  As stated before - it reads like a fan fiction.  The names are all there, but there isn't a lot of depth to the characters.  There's not a great deal of logic to how they went from who they were to the people they have become in this story.

If this story ever becomes a film, it might actually work if they request that JK Rowling polish a few things in order to make it more in line with the Harry Potter canon, rather than wishful thinking fan fiction.

ETA:  I forgot to mention one of the things I found strange about the dialog.  Several of the characters (Ginny and Scorpius to begin with) begin to sound like psychologists talking about people having ""daddy issues"" and ""craving acceptance"".  This was especially odd coming from the younger characters.  Who talks like that?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews","647 people found this helpful"

I wanted to avoid this book since I was unsure of the format.  But downloaded to my iPad Kindle app the night it was released.  I finished in almost one sitting.  It was a very fast read.  The format wasn't entirely horrible, once I got used to reading it and keeping track of who was ""talking"".  Perhaps it translates wonderfully on stage.  There were parts of the script that I was hoping it would be over soon, instead of hoping that it wouldn't end, as was the case with HP1-HP7.

Count me in with the numerous other reviewers who state the obvious.  This script does not read like a JK Rowling piece.  It has too many plot holes.  It has too many concepts just thrown into the novel for the reader to just accept as truth.  I even feel that had JK Rowling ""wrote"" rather than contributed to this script, the prose would have translated with more emotion and character growth for the characters.  Things like the passing of Astoria - between Albus and Scorpius as friends, and Father & Son, Scorpius and Draco - it was almost mentioned in afterthought.  I had to reread a passage to realize that it had happened.  That could have transpired with more reason behind it. I know it was mentioned later in the script at more length as well.

It was nice to return to the familiar world of Harry Potter and his family.  I enjoyed that very much.

I disliked Ron almost entirely in the text.
The time turner was too contrived a concept.

I didn't read much (or any) hype about this book (err play) prior to the release.  Therefore, I was unaware that it was not actually written by J.K. Rowling.  That was a huge surprise to me.  Then again, all of the plot holes - I totally get it now.

To hear that JK Rowling announced that YES, this story is IT.  The finale.  It wraps up Harry Potter's story perfectly.  It feels like such a disservice to long-time loyal fans.  It will leave me with a bitter taste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews","9 people found this helpful"

The play does have some issues. The dialogue is a bit cheesy in many places, and many of the plot points a pretty cliché. If you have read other Harry Potter books, you can easily tell that others are adapting Rowling's original script. But it's not too offensive and a pretty quick read.

If you have read to other Harry Potter books, then definitely get the book, but don't expect the same level of writing as the others.

If you have never read a Harry Potter book, then don't start here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

(I am one of those Harry Potter book lovers. who detested the films -- all but the last--mostly because of Daniel Radcliffe's terrible acting and the HP character's completely wrong cinematic interpretation).

Cummings","This is not a novel!  Know what you are buying before whining about it","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","Know what you are buying!  This is a rehearsal script for a play.  It is *not* a novel.  This will not have the worldbuilding of a novel.  It will not have the deep, multi-faceted character development of a novel.  This is meant to be seen performed onstage.  It is not, and was never intended to be, a follow-up novel in the Harry Potter series.  Look at it like a vignette of their lives 20 years later.  If I see another 1-star review from someone who is disappointed that this isn't a novel like they were expecting, I will scream.  Ugh.  Also, Harry Potter is not the main character here.  His son and Draco Malfoy's son are the protagonists.

That said, it's not an especially compelling play.  It revisits portions of Harry Potter's story through the eyes of his son Albus, from age 11 through 14.  Albus is a typical teenager who doesn't see eye-to-eye with his father, and that's doubly hard considering his father is Harry Potter.  Scorpius Malfoy, as Albus' best friend, is an absolute delight and by far the best character.  Other new characters don't have much to do, since this play focuses on the lead pair.  We do catch up with Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione & Draco and their lives as adults and parents, and how they struggle with the legacy of their own past.

The story was rather predictable and Albus' teen angst brought to mind the worst parts of ""The Order of the Phoenix"" for me, but overall it was fun to spend time with these characters again.  A few times I even smiled.  But meeting Scorpius and an adult Ron were highlights.

Don't expect to be blown away, but don't hate it going in by expecting it to be something it's not.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_117?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=117&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

The first part, which introduces us to Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, is quite good.  The complicated relationship each boy has with their fathers, and their father's own rather tense relationships, make the friendship aspects between the two compelling and sweet.  Scorpius' crush on Rose is likewise adorable.  I liked this story about the burden of being the son of a legendary hero - and the son of a legendary villain.

Then halfway through the book, the two wind up jump-starting a time war between Voldemort and Harry Potter.  The various characters wind up having to try and use paradoxes as weapons, causality as a defense, that sort of thing.  I found that to be rather odd, because I generally do not associate Harry Potter with trying to copy from Star Trek Voyager or Star Trek Enterprise (the temporal mechanics for those shows actually works with HPCC).

That is still my response.

The pros: Story is wonderful. The characters are well represented in personality and expected reactions. We've all waited years to find out what was next for the Wizarding World and what a post-Voldemort existence would mean for Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Draco. Their stories are told extremely well. Their children are equally well represented.

The cons: Really JK..... ?!?!?! You've had years and years. You couldn't have turned THIS story into a full novel to be released the day after the play opened?!?!?! The script is awkward in that it is so obviously written by a group. All of the details are hidden in stage directions and descriptions of what the reader might be seeing on stage. It is almost a ""lazy"" way to present the story.

I have read everything from Beowulf to Chaucer, Shakespeare to Capote, Tolkein to Rowling. I can easily read a stage book, but the story here is frequently lost within that format. My 10 year old daughter reads well and has been easily reading the original books this Summer (along with the Little House series), but this method of storytelling might be more difficult for her. The characters deserved more love from their creator.  And so did their fans, who have made J.K. Rowling so rich (there was no need for a $14.99 price either; $9.99 would have generated plenty of income).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

As for me -- I didn’t hate this story. But I didn’t love it in the same way I did the books in the original Harry Potter series.

I really enjoyed re-visiting the world and the characters that J.K. Rowling created in this play, which she has officially acknowledged on her Pottermore Website as being the eighth installment of the series. I liked seeing what kind of adults Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco grew to be, and I liked getting a glimpse of other beloved characters.

HOWEVER . . . (there’s always a however when it comes to sequels, right?)

There are two plot points that don’t quite reconcile with the Harry Potter universe that Ms. Rowling originally created, and which are holding me back from giving this story a higher rating.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

The time travel element in the story works totally differently from the way it did when Rowling first introduced it in the third book of the series. In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry and Hermione go back in time in order to fulfill a destiny they were already meant to have, not to completely change history. In this story, not only does the Time-Turner device itself work differently, but it also causes characters to create alternate universes in which other characters and the whole course of history are entirely altered in a “butterfly effect” way. This was a great way to create drama and tension in the plot, but since it wasn’t established that way in the initial series, it kept nagging at me the whole time I was reading it.

The other main plot device – a new character turning out to be the love-child of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange – was not as hard for me to swallow, but only just. I could see Bellatrix having the hots for Voldemort – that was apparent in the original books – but it seems out of character for Voldemort. He gave the impression he wasn’t human enough to experience sexual desire. And how come Draco never knew about it, when he was living in Malfoy Manor the whole time this relationship was going on and when said love-child was even born there? Unless they used the “Muffliato” charm to drown out all the noise!

END OF SPOILERS

Also, since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a script and was meant to be experienced in a totally different medium, we don’t get all of the details and history that you would in a traditional novel, and which are necessary for complete character development. This also makes this installment not quite as good as the novels.

I consider plays (and movies) to be merely adaptations of the books they’re based on. That means I can overlook inconsistencies in them and still enjoy them. I can use “suspension of disbelief” to accept things that don’t quite jive – like the fact that Harry wears glasses when you would think that, as a wizard, he should be able to change his eyesight to perfect 20/20 vision. So I could still enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child – if not love it.

But if you’re a stickler for details, you’re probably bound to be disappointed in it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_139?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=139&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Not only because I don't usually read scripts, but also because the script was not written by Rowling herself. (Rather, it was ""based on an original story"" by J.K. Rowling.) When it came right down to it, though, I knew I had to have a copy of the eight installment of Harry's story. So I grabbed my Ravenclaw robe and my wand and headed to the midnight release party. Over the next few hours I binge read all 320 pages and... well, now I have feelings.

This story picks up 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, right at the same place as the original series' epilogue. Harry and Ginny are married with three children: James, Albus, and Lily. The Cursed Child is entirely about Albus, though. The other two are barely mentioned. Of course, Ron and Hermione are also married with children of their own. When this story begins, Albus and Rose, Ron and Hermione's daughter, are beginning their first year at Hogwarts. The nostalgia is back immediately upon reading this very familiar scene, but from there things advance at a breakneck speed.

There are several new characters in The Cursed Child, but the most important ones are Albus and Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son, who become fast friends in much the same way as Harry, Ron, and Hermione did in The Sorcerer's Stone. I really enjoyed both these new characters and loved the relationship between the two of them! While Albus struggles with living up to the Potter name throughout this book, Scorpius has terrible rumors to contend with, and their similar trials bring the two unlikely friends closer together. One character I didn't much care for was Rose. I wonder if the writers were trying to throw back to how unlikable Hermione was in the first book when they wrote Rose's character, but she didn't work for me at all.

Old characters obviously have a huge part as well, but it seems as if all of them have become extreme versions of their original characters. For example, Ron is basically the comic relief of the play. There is actually a scene in which Ron, attempting to be threatening, holds his wand facing the wrong way toward a perceived enemy. Hermione is extremely logical, sometimes to the point of being rude. Then there's Harry, the overworked Ministry employee. I'll come right out and say it: I didn't like Harry in this play at all. He was uncharacteristically mean to pretty much everyone. I did love seeing Draco again, though!

I mentioned before that the plot itself moves extremely fast and that was another of my problems with this. I suspect it would work better as a play with more time between scenes, more time for characters to speak lines, etc. Unfortunately, this script is all a lot of us have and I feel that it should work just as well on paper since it's being sold for $30. Instead it felt like a lot of fan service and throwbacks to the original series crammed into a two part play.

Don't get me wrong, the nostalgia was there and it was a fun read at times! I liked getting to see the old gang back together and there were some fun surprises, but there were times I had a hard time accepting that this is canon. There were plot holes and inconsistencies and downright weird bits that seemed totally random. I can't say much about the plot without spoiling it and I definitely think that everyone should go in as spoiler free as I did.

One other thing I need to mention is the setting and there isn't much of it that's new. All the familiar places from the original series are revisited from Hogwarts to the Ministry of Magic to the Forbidden Forest. Obviously, there isn't much room for description in a script, but I had hoped for some new Wizarding World magic to be introduced instead of rehashing every location of the trio's old stomping grounds.

It's not that I hated The Cursed Child. In fact, I actually did enjoy most of my time reading it! But at the end of the day, I expected this to be so much more and, actually, so much less. There was too much crammed into such a short book and much of what was there just seemed like fan service. I am glad that I read it and do think that any Harry Potter fan should read it too, simply because J.K. Rowling signed off on it, but it is definitely not up to par with the previous seven books.

It was interesting but I just felt like all the characters we knew were terribly out of cannon. I'm sure seeing the play live is magical but I'm just disappointed in the story. Not what I expected I suppose.

On the one hand I am grateful to have something to read from the harry potter universe again but it really did give off a sort of fanfic vibe, as in it didn't seem like this was real... like this isn't really what JKR would write if she were to write an 8th book.

Ah well. Still enjoyable for what it was. Mixed emotions. I'm am happy there was further redemption for Snape (my absolute favorite character) but I certainly missed his snarky wonderfulness.

CONTAINS SPOILERS!***
Let me start by saying that the dialogue is complete S***. Rarely does it possess the unique charm and sense of antiquity we've come to expect from the wizarding world. More often than not the characters (particularly the kids) sound more like your typical American street teenagers than British wizards. I know it's set in the future, and as Millennials our speech is different than that of our parents, but c'mon. Below are just a few of many gems. Ask yourselves, is this really the way any wizard in the HP universe would realistically talk?

Delphi/Hermione: This really doesn't feel how I – I even sound like her! Triple wow.

Scorpius: No. No way, José. If we're doing this, we're doing it (he puts on a pair of familiar-looking glasses with a smile) together.

They also use the words ""friggin"", ""lame"", and ""uber geek."" And I should add that there's a scene where Harry actually refers to Professor McGonogall as ""Minerva."" I know that it's been a loooong time since he's been a student of hers, but really??? He also threatens her with Ministry action if she doesn't do what he wants, and she bows down and takes it. I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine either of them reacting this way. There are many other examples I could cite where people say/do things that are completely out of character for them, but I'd be here all day.

I have to say, I liked the twist where Albus was sorted into Slytherin. Remember in the epilogue of DH where he's so nervous about being in that house? Well, our suspicions are confirmed in CC! I also found it interesting that Voldemort ended up having a child.

The story is intense, exciting and interesting, but due to the flaws I mentioned above, I can't say I found it all that great. Personally, if I were the writers, I would edit the dialogue to not sound so ""modern"" and ""American.""

Rowling, which is why I'm so bummed that I found Harry Potter and the Cursed Child disappointing :( I understand that this story was set in a much later phase than the original HP books, but it still seemed like the characters were very OOC. In fact, the characters I enjoyed most were the new young protagonists. I also found the plot to be a bit ridiculous and cliche. However, the book was a quick read (I read it in about three hours), and it was awesome to revisit the world of Harry Potter. I also really enjoyed the script format, as I'm an aspiring screenwriter. Although I didn't much enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it made me remember how much I love the Harry Potter world, and now a reread of the first seven books (and maybe even a rewatch of the movies :) is on my to do list.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The play format is jarring in its departure from the vibrancy of previous books in the series. The characters come off largely wooden with Snape's and Malfoy's change arguably the most odd. This is obviously not a Rowling work although she obviously authorized the publication. Like other reviewers, I agree the time travel aspect is contrived and old hat.

The plot, while good reading, did not get the benefit of character development like the rest of the books, so that was disappointing.  I never got to feel I was really cheering for Albus, nor did I feel as involved with the other characters as in the original series.  It would have been nice to have a book about Harry Potter after the big battle and not jump into a return with his son being older than Harry was when we met him for the first time.  I didn't have that 'feel' for Albus' or Scorpio Malfoy characters nor any of the other characters.  Even the original gang just seemed as 'distant relatives' we all remembered, and there was a loss of caring about everyone in the book.  The only way to describe it is - It was like coming from the 3D special effects of the HP movies, to  paper cut-out dolls you move yourself to the plot...so very disappointing after missing reading the books to myself, my kids that visit, and my grandchildren as we eagerly awaited each new book...the grandchildren did not like this book either...they said it was 'boring'","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Reader","Missing the magic","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","This is NOT the new Harry Potter Book you've been waiting for. It resembles them in name only. This is a tough review... I think it manages to squeak an extra two stars only because I missed the characters so very much. It was a tough call, I thought about two stars, and the spiteful part of me wanted to give it one star. But at the end of the day it did hold my interest for the two days it took to finish it. But to repeat, and--this cannot be over stated: This IS NOT A HARRY POTTER BOOK. This is a shadow of a Harry Potter Book. I'm not even sure after reading this I'd be inclined to see the Play, unless the cast is exceptional and not just there because they looked like the characters.

Everything about this is a let down, as the title states, its missing the magic. The brilliant writing, the excellent descriptions, the fantastic characters, and even the magic is reduced to one word and maybe an extra couple result words if it worked. Listen, I knew this was a draft of a script. I don't mind scripts and I know their inherent limitations... but this is just embarrassing. You get so little *anything.* Harry has a somewhat unexplained anger problem and he's a straight up dick to his child. You get no sense that this is even Harry in anything but name only--ditto for every other character. They act in unexplained and seemingly unfamiliar ways.

In this ""book"" you have nothing that made the books great. The writing is sub par even for a script. The characters are mere card board cut outs of their old selves with no depth and seemingly bizarre reactions, anger, stupidity, more stupidity and no charm or love. Nothing in this is shown, its all told, but with 0 set up to really make you feel... and then there is the story itself. God what a terrible and played out story. Its like JK was toying around with a cute little short story and friends or her editor at the publishing company begged her to let them run with it to save their jobs. I can't imagine she was especially impressed or happy with this. Because of Hermione's incompetence terrible evil is unleashed on the world. And what incompetents it is! Not to mention the ministry has about the worst security ever conceived. They could using something as simple as a password? And the rest of the story will be familiar to ever science fiction fan ever... what a predictable snooze.

So on the plus side official harry potter that at least kept me entertained over a couple days... but it was a short predictable story missing all of the magic both literal and figurative that made you fall in love with Harry Potter. The characters don't seem real, their crappy attitudes are never explained, and that Hermione--now the big boss--would keep the most powerful Macguffin ever someplace anybody with a polyjuice potion can get to it--and that the whole ministry can be infiltrated this way--is 100% stupid and hard to swallow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews","5 people found this helpful"

I am in my 60s and have within the past 2 years read the Harry Potter series-all books bought used. I enjoyed them tremendously.  They flowed from the novel to the next.  What a surprise this one was.  I knew it was a play, and there was a gap of several years, but it is more like a very short story.  Nothing covered about their life after they defeated Voldemort.  I would like to have read about their marriages, the birth of their children. The fans have been tremulously let down.  One of Hermione and Ron's child is mentioned once in the entire book.

I feel like many reviews totally dumped on it, said it ruined HP for them, ruined characters, etc and I don't feel like that's fair. First, this is not written by JK Rowling, so it's not going to be up to par with the other seven. Secondly, it's in a script format so it reads completely different from the others. You don't get all the back story and details like a normal book would give you. You have to go into it with different expectations. I enjoyed it and thought it was interesting to imagine Harry and the gang as adults. To me, this was adjunct to the serious, not necessarily part of the original.

I think people who give it one star are being a bit harsh. It deserves at least two stars and I personally give it three because I enjoy the time spending with all these characters again. I understand that a lot of fans hate it because it cannot compare with the classic harry potter series - mostly because the characters are not very well founded and some are (let us be honest) distorted - but I appreciate the idea that great people can at the meantime make huge mistakes and how people can change in response to circumstances and alternate realities. What happened to us make us who we are. Our choices make us who we are. I like that part and it is not a betrayal to J.K. Rowling's original ideas in the classic series. The spirit is there, but it does need better writing. Honestly, I think if you are a harry potter fun and you really want to enjoy reading it, just take it as a fan fiction and you will give it five stars.

I'm unsure of how much influence JK Rowling had in the writing of this book as the writing style wasn't as thought out as her previous HP novels.  It could best be described as field notes or ""over coffee"" conversation of ""what ifs"".  In the end, the book is a bunch of fluff and gives fans some material for unanswered questions from the series.  Honestly the same could have been accomplished by a blog series on Pottermore or similar.

It should be emphasized that this is a script for a play, and therefore the differences in medium don't allow for J.K. Rowling's typical wonderful detailing, plot intricacies, and character work on the page. Additionally, it's not solely by J.K. Rowling, and I think that shows.
If you buy this, be prepared to not get the same level of fully fleshed out story, with the same level of detail, warmth, humor, and complexity of her original 7 books. Perhaps if I had seen the play, and therefore seen what the actors brought to the stage, this script could've been a nice companion piece, but as a standalone piece of work, it is a little bit lacking for me.
If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, however, and want to read every work she's written, you may still find this enjoyable, as there are some surprising revelations in this book that build and expand on the original 7.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

These Aren't The Potters Your'e Looking For....","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2016","I was very excited to read this as its been so long I've been able to check in with the world of Harry Potter.  First, I found it a little difficult to read due to the fact that it was a script, but I can overlook that.  The storyline, however, was a bit convoluted for my tastes.  It is blatently obvious that JK Rowling did not write this book as the feel and actions of all the characters save Harry himself felt foreign.  The friendship between Albus and Scorpious was strange and bordered on a love story (which I have no issue with, but if thats what its supposed to be, play it up guys!).  And perhaps the strangest part was learning that VOLDEMORT and Belatrix once did the horizontal mambo and gave birth to a child... geeez.  That makes Voldemort seem too human and normal, kinda like finding out that Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars moonlighted as a pasty chef or something.
All in all, a decent read, but I look forward to more content from the imagination of JK Rowling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The minimum you need to know is that it is a worthwhile read (if a bit short due to it being a play) and if you like Harry Potter than you should read this (if you haven't already).

The story (without giving away spoilers, which is difficult) starts where the last book/movie ended, at the train station where adult Harry is sending his second child off to Hogwarts. From there, we follow Albus (Harry's second son) through his adventures with Scorpius (Draco Malfoy's son). We see adult Ron, Hermonie, Harry, and Ginny throughout and also welcome so other beloved characters back.

Overall I enjoyed it. I loved seeing what happened after the events of the Deathly Hallows.  I would have liked to have seen more of Albus as he adjust to life at Hogwarts (which turns out to be hard for him) but that is hard to do as a play so I have to forgive a little of the writers speeding through parts that would otherwise interest me.  The writing/dialogue feels a little off compared to the source material and at times seems forced but it is hard to read a play manuscript the same way you would read a book. I definitely would like to see it on stage because alot of the stage directions look really difficult to pull off (I do community theater so I have some stage experience and I couldn't even beging to figure out how they would do some of the things the directions say to do).

The story also has some really touching moments between Harry and Albus. They both have to grow as people and build their rocky Father/Son relationship. It does a good job of showing how hard it would be for someone to have a famous father with all the expectations surrounding it.

In summary, it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the collection but will likely fall somewhere in the middle of ranking for favorites.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

When I heard it was a play script, not an actual novel, my excitement was tempered and after reading it, glad it was.

The most important part is that it's a play. Meant to be acted out within a watchable amount of time. So even in two parts, it's missing a lot of what made the series great, sort of like the movies if the books had been exactly like them. The plot is pretty jerky on it's own, even poorly explained in areas, and makes a lot of new plot elements seem nonsensical as we're given no context or explanation for how. Characters as well have changed with no description of how or why, even simplified in cases, and overall missing the level of detail that made Potter great. And the writing style and word choice are again not in line with any of her previous work.

But as it's a play script, and I knew that going in, it's decent. Still a bit unsteady on it's own, but more than serviceable. As a novel(which is seems even those people who knew it was a play script were expecting), it utterly fails but that's to be expected. With actors speaking and the effects of the play, I can imagine that even a script that seems subpar(though I don't think this one quite is) could be amazing.

That being said, the base story and ideas of the play ARE good and promising. If Rowling decided to expand upon it, flesh out the story and characters for a 8th Harry Potter book(which this is ultimately not), I could see it being a fine conclusion to the series.

As for specific plot details I felt strongly about(SPOILERS):

1. The idea of Voldemert having a child. Interesting concept enough, but this is one of those ideas that needs explanation. Most importantly, how it was kept a secret from literally every Death Eater. This is especially something I would like expanded in the novel.

2. The time-traveling. I thought it was an interesting turn from the series that I was not expecting. Though again I would have liked a lot more explanation for how each changed affected the timeline, I liked the idea on it's own. Going full circle and all that. Also, doing it this way was actualy a great way to keep it a Harry Potter book, even when he's not the main character.

3. Albus and Scorpius. There's an idea I liked and fortunately was carried off well. A Potter in Slytherin, a Malfoy and a Potter being best friends, and I simply enjoyed both of them as characters. They were the most classic Harry Potter parts of the script, and it really pays off.

4. The general themes. Even as a play, this is easily one of if not the most mature of the series, and(especially as it's only a small part of the story) requires a bit of thought to really get it all. There's two general themes going on. The first being the life of the child of the great world-saving Hero, when they themselves aren't extraordinary themselves. Fighting against comparisons, rebelling, and in general Albus' view of his legacy is well done, and the most satisfying part of the book. The other theme(the one I found most interesting) is the idea that even if the Hero saves the world, defeats the evil wizard, keeping it safe may be harder. This is Harry's side of the book, and shows a weathered Harry, worn down by years of overworking trying to keep the world he died for running. Hermionie is another one, sacrificing home-life to run the wizarding world. Though this part of the book is not completely resolved, it's the kind of thing I imagine a novel would really flesh out, so if their was one, this would be the reason to be excited.

OVERALL though, i enjoyed it. Not so much for what was written, or the way it was written, becasue as a play script, both og those on their own can be very misleading and miss the point. But for the general story threads and themes I thought were well done and deserving of the Potter legacy. I do understand how people are dissapointed, but I do have to say that it has been pretty clear for a while that it's not a novel, it's a play and thus will be nothing like the previous books, but I digress. There's no need to recommend it as any hardcore fan already has it, but if you're a holdout and possibly turned off by the bad reviews, I recommend getting it as long as you know what you're are getting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

“…the Cursed Child” is presented as a play, so the reader has to imagine the staging which could approximate the wonderful CGI effects of the films. However, the films were always driven by the vivid writing and imagination of the PotterMeistresse J.K Rowling, and the settings are scenes we know from the books and movies:  Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic, Cedric Hollow.  So our imaginations don’t have to stretch too far.
The strength of the Harry Potter series has always been the relationships between the characters.  In “…the Cursed Child” the key relationships are between generations, as the young Albus Potter and the young Scorpius Malfoy struggle to define themselves separately from their famous (or notorious) fathers. The antagonist is also revealed at the end to have parental issues (trying desperately to avoid spoilers here.)  Harry shows some of the same character flaws that made him human in ""...Deathly Hallows"" - an orphan, he doesn't really know how to be a parent. He makes some bad choices, which will make us all cringe... but haven't we all done things and said things as parents that we wish we could take back and have a do-over?

If you are a Potter fan, this is an intriguing sequel, focusing mostly on Albus, to whom we were introduced in the coda to “…the Deathly Hallows.”  Rowling has quite a few descendants of the Potter/Granger /Weasley trio left with futures to explore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As a book, it is just a flat story. Or, actually, a story trying to be deep but having only flat characters. I won't deny I have felt happy with this book as I haven't in ages. Almost ten years since the last Harry Potter came to my hands. Last night I experienced the same: I couldn't stop reading it - finished around 4 in the morning. But once it was over, came the disappointment. Those people are not people I once knew. Some of them still talk the same way they used to, even Dumbledore as a painting on the wall. But the majority of it sounds different. Like if someone just tried Rowling's in a polyjuice potion and forgot that talent wouldn't come along. I recommend you to read it because we fans deserve something after these many years, but keep your expectations low, please.

I read it in 6 hours because I was committed, but even 10 pages into it I was bummed. Since it's a script format, you don't get the same experience as a true Harry Potter book. There's no magic, wonder, or imagination needed to create the setting. It's all laid out with italicized actions that the characters are supposed to do on stage. No one is true to character... it's just not the same and I'm skeptical how much JK actually contributed to this nonsense. My biggest complaint is that you can figure out the basic plot of it early on, so nothing really came as a surprise. Like, ""oh I saw that coming from 100 pages ago. This is lame.""

And when the Sorting Hat revealed Albus' house, everything changed for the little boy. Then there's Draco Malfoy's son, Scorpious, whose parentage became the talk of the town, especially with the rumors milling about the existence of the Time Turner.

OKay, let me set this straight. I am a Potterhead. I have loved all Harry Potter books by JK Rowling, including The Fantastic Beasts (I know, HP's not there, but semantics...) Yet, somehow, Harry Potter and The Cursed Child didn't live up to my expectations. The wizard inside me is kind of disappointed because I thought the story was all hyped but lacked sincerity and Harry Potter messed up bigtime.  Where's the good old Harry that I loved? Draco Malfoy behaved even more mature than Harry and Ron combined. My muggle heart is crushed. 

For all we know, this book clearly was written to redeem Malfoy. I don't have any issues with that. I liked Draco in the first 8 books a lot, he's the anti-hero that annoyed me and enchanted me at the same time. I actually loved his son Scorpious more than Harry's son, Albus Severus!  OMG. Harry's kid is sulky, manipulative and broody. I wasn't surprised when he wasn't taken into the Gryffindor house. I don't know, I just didn't like him, although I understood his doubts and insecurities, and furthermore, his intention to help the Diggorys..

Lily Luna (Harry & Ginny's daughter) and Rose (Ron and Hermione's daughter) were also my favorites. And yes, the twist about the daughter of The One Who Must Not be Named, did it for me and got me really good. 

I didn't mind the script version of the book, it was rather fine with me. The characters and Hogwarts reawakened my love for everything magical and enchanted, but Draco really stood out there for me. Although, there's still something about the whole story that fell short. I thought it lacked the heart and details that I so fervently devoured from the past 8 books. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed reading the book until the end. I guess I could never outgrow the Potterhead in me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

So I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I grew up with the series, became an adult when the characters did. This is a series that affected my life. I wasn't eager to read this book as some HP fans were because it wasn't really written by Rowling, so I honestly didn't get the big deal. Yes, she was involved and it's based on her story but it's not another Harry Potter novel, at least not to me.

I enjoyed the plot, seeing where all of our favorites ended up and the introduction of new characters. Scorpious was probably the best part of the book. I can't say much without spoilers, but I liked the idea of how the past can affect the present and how little moments can change the course of the future.

But overall, I wasn't in love with this book. I'd like to see a production, but I wish it hadn't been published as a play and instead as a story JK Rowling wrote herself. There were several awkward moments written in the play's instructions that I had long pauses at. And mostly I wish Ron hadn't been turned into a bumbling idiot. That and I felt it dragged on a little bit too much. Near the end there was a plot twist that came out of left field and the explanation even more bizarre.

Overall like I said I enjoyed it (but I can't talk about what I enjoyed because SPOILERS). But ultimately this book just made me want to reread the originals.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_140?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=140&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Since this is written as a play, there isn't much depth or emotion involved. Everyone comes off as superficial due to the constraints of the script style. I didn't connect with Albus mainly because there isn't time given to actually flesh out the character.  It's just one whirlwind scene after another with very little cohesiveness between scenes.

The time travel gimmick has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the table. Imagine Back to the Future meets It's a Wonderful Life and you have HP and the Cursed Child.

What bothers me most is the contradictions this story now brings to the original series.

1) Harry's Scar hurts...  We were told that it never hurt again in the classics.
2) Voldemort has a daughter with Bellatrix? How convenient considering there's no indication during the classics that she was with child.
3) Where did this new prophecy come from? While the prophecy *could* have came after the classic series, it's not clear who or when this came about, but given that prophecies were written in the originals to be only heard by those they are about, it doesn't fit that Delphi would know about it.
4) The return to the Tri-wizard maze.  Are you trying to tell me that any version of Mad Eye Moody wouldn't have stomped out that effort to disrupt his plan to bring Voldemort back?

The beginning of this book is good, but it all starts to fall apart after Rose insults Scorpius. The first seven books prove that Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are about not judging people based on who their aancestors were. Clearly those rules went out the window. The rest of the beginning of the book seems skipped and out of place. When we finally get to the part when Albus and Scorpius become friends, I actually thought Albus was gay based on his actions toward Scorpius. About time-turners, I wish that I could time-turn myself to when I was buying this book and stop myself from buying it.

Time travel backwards into the previous scenes created by Rowling in past books seemed a convenient way for her to avoid to avoid allowing outsiders to mess up her masterfully created fictional world. I liked the new characters' angst, but the story seemed to depend too much on that and not enough on real suspense. I have read many time travel stories and this one was not particularly  original or ingenious, particularly because the places the visited were already places I'd been to in the first 7 books. I likely expect too much from a play script after a steady diet of Rowling's masterful narratives in her 7 consecutive Harry Potter books.

  The first review I saw was by a 10 year old who sped read it and gave it a 6/10 rating.  I wasn’t thinking of being that harsh, but upon reflection, I’d have to concur for similar and differing reasons.  First I will say, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is an entertainment.  You will most likely enjoy reading it and think it was fun.  The issue comes with reflection.  Now, the majority of Harry Potter fans are, I would dare say, a reflective lot.  I bought my copy at a midnight book party with costume dress and trivia leading into the purchase hour.  One of the trivia questions asked, “What was Harry Potter’s Mother’s maiden name?”  I have no Idea.  But there are Potter fans that know this.  And with this book, they should know they are getting a script of a West End play.  An entertainment.

  Myself, I started reading the Harry Potter series of books after the first movie came out.  I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, and then picked up a copy of The Chamber of Secrets to read.  I read the rest of the books and saw the movies as they came out.  And, to be honest, I haven’t actually finished reading the original one, since I had seen the movie.  I have saved it to read with my child, and as we read it, I’m continually surprised by the addition of things I didn’t know – the differences from having only seen the movie.

  The first flaw, I have with the book/script,  is that that is exactly what it is.  If you see the play, there is no need to get the book/script.  If you read the script – as I said, it is an entertainment and you will probably very well want to see the play in its original intended version.  The pictures on the internet did look amazing.  But releasing this as a definitive addition to the Harry Potter mythology, I feel, breaks the nice symbiosis that the movies and books had with each other.  The movies are great, they’re awesome, they’re a visual masterpiece that manages to capture the soul and intention of the book as well as it can.  And you can always go back to the book and enjoy the parts they omitted for the sake of getting it to the screen in a bit over 2 hours.  In this book/script, what is omitted does not exist.

  The final scene from the original Harry Potter series takes a leap 19 years into the future.  It lays down 19 years of “not much going on here – scar not hurting” and ages our protagonists to the point where they are able to have their own families and “enjoy” a “normal” existence.  In a world as robust as the one Rowling created – I felt a little jipped.  I thought there was loads of room, in that interim, for stories to take place in this world that would stand on their own 2 feet.  And even though the Fantastical Beast Movie is to take place before the Potter era, Rowling has already expanded the historical lore and mythology of her world to accommodate the entry of this piece.

  So, If we can swallow and concede that 19 year period, as we must, this is where the Cursed Child starts.  And it starts exactly at this point, on the platform of 9 ¾ with the new generation of Potters, Weasleys, Graingers and Malfoys boarding the Hogwarts express.  The book/play exists within the next 4 years.  Taking it for what would be a fourth year setting – which coincidentally would be the Goblet of Fire year - feelings and conflicts that developed and molded the original Potter protagonists in 4 books and 4 movies – occur in the span on a one book/two part play.  And with that, the playwright uses up 4 years of what could be rich character development.

  In place of this development, the play really does rely on the audience to bring the beloved book/movie series with them as supplement.  Rowling said in her farewell to the Potter series.  “So, I never wanted to write another novel, but this will give the fans something special.” That is, at times, what this book/script feels like.  It feels a bit like fiction specifically for a fan.  Albeit, entertaining fan fiction.  It brings in the beloved characters, even ones long, long dead.  And they make their way across the stage to have their curtain call.

  It is not, admittedly, as simple as that.  There are some special things in it.  There is a scene on the Hogwarts express that develops a character in a crazy and amazing way.  There is a friendship among the two main protagonists that will really make you wish you had a book series to go back to in order to get the full effect.  And one series original bad guy is fleshed out and matured in a way I think many fans will like.  But the story plays in the Potter Universe, it doesn’t essentially expand it.  And that was the brilliant aspect of each book.  Each book grew the universe in a unique and ingenious way, introducing small aspects that would eventually play into the grand conclusion.

  The play/book is entertaining, and I think even the strongest critic may be able to honestly pull out something they thought was interesting, exciting or nice to see.  But as an endorsed conclusion to the series, it felt a bit like a hasty farewell.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

If you really want to read it, then I don't think you'll be able to resist buying it even if you've heard whispers of discontent about the plot.

I think it's pretty fair to say JK Rowling was pretty clear that this wasn't a full out novel, it's just the published script of the play in London. So my review is not because I thought I was mislead. I was extremely aware this was the script.

My quip is with the storyline itself. It's pretty clear after a few scenes in, you realize there's very little to JK Rowling's actual writing style, but you're curious enough anyway to continue reading to see how the story progresses. Obviously, it's not going to read like a novel narrative, and the story is told through conversations that are happening in very specific situations.

There are the obvious moral undertones to the story.
- The Father/Son Dynamic between Harry/Albus, Draco/Scorpio and all the torrential feelings when a parent is trying to understand their child.
- Going back in time to change the past doesn't necessarily make for a better future

And things of that sort. So the story line does have some depth to it, and there's that moment of small gratification that Severus gets.. and it's satisfying for a person that's always been a fan of his character.

But otherwise.. the rest of the plot just leaves you head scratching. How time turners are used in the Cursed Child vs in the original series is different. And there's a huge focus on time travel, and it's kind of disorienting. I appreciate the flashbacks of the original story line, but I'm here for NEW material.

And really.. the biggest thing I had a problem with was the love child of lord voldemort and bellatrix. Really? We just had to go there? Trying to imagine the lord of absolute darkness and evil, the person who was willing to split his soul into 7 pieces, an indiscriminate murder who's M.O was strictly for finding revenge on HP and returning to power, having a love child in the middle of all that? And yes, I've heard the argument that he would've wanted an heir, but clearly, if he could survive in Prof. Quirrell's head, would immortality really be an issue for him? Would an heir actually be necessary? The whole prospect seemed pretty absurd to me.

All in all.. I was just left confused and just wondering... why?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

K. Rowling's massive popular Harry Potter series have begged for more to the Harry Potter series. With Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, we have received exactly what we asked for. It was nice to see all the characters that I have grown to love come back and tell some more of their story. While it was nice to learn more about what happened with Voldermort during the Battle for Hogwarts, the story went by too fast. One of the major things that bothered me was the format of the story. Since it was in a scrip format, the story took a couple of hours to read and didn't have the same writing skill that I have come to know and love with Rowling's writings. I would have much preferred to see the story in prose instead of a script. I miss so much of the detail because of the format the story was delivered in. As for the plot, it reminded me of Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol with issues for the future. I would like to see Rowling turn this script into a novel, then it would be something I would cherish and add to my prized Harry Potter collection.

Obviously as a true HP fan I had to buy it, but it's not a masterpiece like the other books. To be fair, it's a screenplay and it's not necessarily meant to be read but watched, which I have taken into account in my review. But the story has some obvious plot holes and timelines that just don't add up. The first few pages were fast paced and the story line irritiated me so much I even stopped reading it for a few days. But it did get better towards the end and it gives you a glimpse into what could have happened, if a few things had been different.

I wish I had skipped this one.
The books starts as the Epilogue of book 7.  Probably copied word for word.  We already know who married who and who the kids are.  But that was ok.  The real problem is how stupid and contrived everyone is.  The ""old"" characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are caricatures of their childhood selves.  Harry and Hermione really have those positions at 40 years of age?  Ron is bumbling idiot.  I hated seeing these guys reduced to these boring people.  The new characters are just as bad.  Albus and Scorpius are whiners.  That is really all I can say about them.
What would have been great would have been to continue the story with the ""old"" characters and to really fill them out.  Or to pretty much exclude them all together and only concentrate on the kids.  It felt like character development was in short supply.  Yes, I know it is a play.

Not a new edition, but actually an eighth novel. For that, I was tempted to rate it 5 stars before actually reading the book because it's HARRY POTTER, the boy who lived! Even though this book wasn't written entirely by J.K. Rowling, the fact that she supervised its production was enough for me to already love it and, of course, wish to apparate to London to watch the play.

But now that I've actually read it, I can clearly say two things:

a) I LOVE SCORPIUS MALFOY SO MUCH.

and,

b) Despite that it is the ""eighth"" Harry Potter novel, it doesn't quite feel like Harry Potter.

It's not that I didn't enjoy the book (I sort of did), but the magical feeling I used to get when reading a new HP book was almost non-existent. I know lots of readers say it's because of the script format, but that wasn't my case at all. It had more to do with what happens to the characters, how they have developed over all these years, and a few other things that were definitely too far-fetched (and totally bonkers) to belong in an HP book. And by far-fetched/bonkers I mean so many WTF moments that fellow readers actually warned me about.

HOWEVER, all the silliness of Cursed Child made me laugh out loud constantly. I couldn't help it, it was just too much. So despite it all, I enjoyed it. After my initial shock, rage, and disappointment, somewhere around the middle of the book I allowed myself to relax and think that everything I was reading was nothing more than a reaaaaally small gift for us readers from the HP world.

With that said, I won't tell more about it in fear of spoiling the book (because trust me, just the minor detail spoils a lot) but I will say that the only thing that is like HP, and what readers WILL probably enjoy, is the friendship that blooms between Albus (Harry's son) and Scorpius (Malfoy's son). I liked it. And Scorpius Malfoy more than anything else because he is the one that steals the spotlight in this book. He's very well the reason why everyone should read Cursed Child.

Final Verdict:

In other words, Harry Potter and the Curse Child is basically like a J.K. Rowling approved fanfic, nothing more. At least, that's how it felt like to me. So if you are looking for a mind-blowing and powerful novel at the same level of the other HP books, then I'm afraid you'll be terribly disappointed. And a bit ragey? Maybe a lot.

And yet, I do suggest reading it because it's a short read and you all have to be in the loop anyway. Don't let peeps tell you! Check it out of the library if you don't want to pay so much for a copy (it IS quite expensive and not that worth it). But you do have to meet Scorpius Malfoy one way or another. You have to meet him. So do it for him, okay? Good. :)

I wasn't one of the people lined up at midnight to get the book, but I was interested to see where JK Rowling pictured the story going for the next generation.

The script-style of writing made it fairly easy to read through quickly. We get a feel for the characters and what's changed and yet there's a lot of overlap with what we saw in the books/movies. It felt like a lot of re-used material and things thrown in that we've already seen. Once or twice would have been enough, but it felt like a lot was things that already happened. In fact, that's basically the premise of the book.

And it's heartbreaking that so few characters have moved on from the lives they had back at Hogwarts in the '90's, but I just didn't love this book. There are some nice insights and I liked how Scorpius and Draco's relationship mirrored Harry and Albus's. I think had it been a story that focused on family alone it could have been really great.

But to have pretty much every character have a child to have a next generation of kids (and to send them all to Hogwarts!)  this story was so ambitious in trying to cram everything in it just tried to much in too little space.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

For instance, Ron's sort of bumbling, almost insecure nature in this reading made no sense against his teenage self. Looks as if marrying Hermione really turned him into a wuss. Also Harry seems to have lost some personal fortitude over the years. There are points in the cursed child that Harry feels a little too ordinary and thin compared to his younger days. Overall, I would say that the storytelling itself is inferior to the original Potter books. Perhaps some sacrifices were made to adapt the story as a play, but it made for a somewhat disappointing read.

Rowling with creating a place where most of us would have liked to sample. The fluidity of her books and to a lesser degree the moves actually transported us to every location in and out of the wizarding world. I also saw at the end of the last story a different path. And as much as my creativity and writing in know ways  compares to Ms. Rowling. I would have rater seen development of some of he the other  characters; like Luna Love good or Neville Long bottom than to tear away at the Legend of Harry Potter. I understand there are few really happy endings in the real world, this one took the long way to arrived and was somewhat anticlimactic. Delphi was a Red Herring, And I don't like Red Herring it is a somewhat lazy way to get to the heart of the story.  I also believe Albus picking someone more likely than not is a bit of a stretch after vocally voicing his fear just at the mere idea of becoming a Slitheren moments before there was more of a relationship. He spoke to his dad rather than his mum. I understand father and sons frequently have daddy issues as much or more than women, but this wasn't how it was left in Deathly Hallows.  For all intentions totally ignored the the Epilogue of the final book.
I admit I am a purest and a stickler for details and continuity, and this story had very little. I was thrilled to see another Harry Potter story, but it is hard to believe a man who clearly had always wanted a family, a life time of abuse, could have followed a number of paths to swear not to be anything like Vernon and Aunt Petunia, cruel, cold and making his life of misery, and be the best father possible, not cruel and cold. I know parents make lots of mistakes, I lived through my fair share. And I know it is as painful as mothers and daughters, and men hide their feeling more I know all that rubbish. At sometimes you accept them for who they are. And there many things worse than a famous Father, with all the perks that come with that. Scorpius put him in his place and I liked. It was more contrived and had the feeling that the special set and effects held too high a priority. It was a quick read, and I am sure every person regarding them self as the book already. I know grown up that I am, that I stood in line at real bookstores to get my at Midnight special openings, but this was just unnecessary to bring us back to show how flawed Harry was and  his son that had precisely Lily's eyes, and what was in the  ending of Deathly Hallows story Albus Serverus was afraid and waited to speak with his father alone not his mum. Dad would understand guy stuff. Even wizard's guy stuff. It didn't take too my much of my time so I say read  probably more  than 50% will probably love it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

However Harry Potter novel fans crave character development since its the characters they love. The genre is somewhat limited. It relies heavily on its popularity to supplement that absent quality. In its place is a moral quality that reads more preachy than her normal writings, about the dangers of stereotyping. The adult angst is more about unmet childhood needs than quality storytelling. Its a good play, but her writings are great. And her stories are better than this. Her characters all have flaws but these overly discussed moral flaws dont touch our hearts the way her storytelling does and it sounds more like a therapy reenactment at times than a relationship.  No one wants a stereotyped Harry Potter, but perhaps thats the best that can be achieved in a play script. We cant hear his complex thinking or feel the sublties of ambivalence and shifting thoughts. Overall its good but far less mature than JK Rowlings' stories.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Meaning, I couldn't wait to buy it and read it and go back to that world, but that's the trick isn't it? They have our money already, they always would. But, oh well. We knew we had to read it so what is there to say about it?

Well, the name Scorpius is downright godawful, cringeworthy every time I read it.

A lot of the dialogue was cheesy as hell! People getting mad and saying cliches like ""you won't get away with this!"" I don't know it was just annoying A LOT of the time.

The pros? It's Harry Potter. That's about it.

As others have said, the characterization too frequently feels wrong, and too much of the past is revisited. It just isn't inspired. There are lots of spells but no magic. The live experience may make up for at least some of the script's shortcomings, though, and I do still hope the stage show comes to America.

I was very excited about this next installment of the story. This is no where near her in depth stories with details that put you in the moment. It will give you the fan ""fix"" of getting to spend time with your favorite characters again. However, after finishing the book, I feel let down by the lack of substance and that is probably partially due to it being a play and not a book. The story could have been developed better and had potential to be a great book but because it was not developed fully as a book and had to be put in a play it lacked a lot of the feeling you get while reading a Harry Potter book.

As an avid HP fan I was ecstatic that we would finally be getting new material in the the world. I read this book in less than 3 hours. While I thought the story itself was fantastic - I was disappointed on the format. JK Rowling is an author, not a playwright. It almost reads as really good fan-fiction. We are missing the great detail and imagery that JK is so great at describing. After 9 years I was hoping to be immersed into the world again and was sadly disappointed that I was only about half way there. I'm sure that this stage play is excellent, but it was almost like seeing a decent movie before reading an excellent book.
Oh, but how I did love learning about the original HP characters as adults and their children. Harry, Ron, and Hermionie haven't changed much since we last saw them. Even more so, I love the Albus/Scorpius dynamic! Getting to know Draco's son and by extension learning about Draco in a new light was so refreshing. The end of Deathly Hallows showed us that the Malfoy's, above all, value family. It was sad to read that his wife died and he was left to raise a son on his own the best he could. It's so sweet to see that Draco chose a more loving path versus his own more competitive and pressured upbringing that his father gave him. I would have loved to learn more about this little family.
I did not understand the line drawn with Albus wanting to become involved in helping the Cedric death. It did not make sense to me. and why did they decide to go to eat individual task in the Tri Wizard Tournament to mess him up when it was the final task that he actually meets Voldemort? That doesn't make any sense to me. It just felt like they were doing whatever they could to tie in something from every book... It didn't seem clear enough why Albus wanted to get involved when the story was presenting him as a moody, Slytherin teenager. Why help with something in his father's past? A father he was mad at?
It was nice to see that the Dursley's had a small role to play in this, that Dudley sent Harry the blanket he arrived in as a baby as Privet Drive. It would be nice to see their reunions and communication to develop this relationship.
It was, however, farfetched to believe that Bellatrix is the mother of Delphi, as she is the daughter of Voldemort. I recall from the original books Bellatrix was so loyal to Voldemort that she was in love with him. How was a pregnancy concealed and what exactly was the timeline involved? Bellatrix was already a crazy person so is that why no one suspected a pregnancy? How was he even able to reproduce? The guy doesn't even have a nose... There are a lot of questions that I would like answered here.
All in all, I was happy with the story but definitely would like the rest of the questions answered. And would love to see a series spin-off with Albus Potter to continue the journey!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

We were all expecting/hoping/praying for it to be the eighth book in the series, to continue on our childhood, however, it got blown way out of proportion. While it reads well, and has an intriguing theory, it's nowhere near the quality of writing we came to expect from J.K herself. It's a well wrote fan fiction, that is really just a theory. Read it- if you loved the Harry Potter series, really read it, but don't expect it to be the answers to your prayers because it's not.

Overall the story works. The characters read flat, perhaps because they are intended to be acted. I felt as though the characters didn't age realistically and did things not realistic to who they are. Overall, it was okay. If you are a fan, you probably need to read it just to maintain your sanity. Was it worth 14 dollars, probably not, but I couldn't not read it. I had many of the same issues with it that I had with the second half of book 7.  It was okay, but if you're really needing a fix, go back and reread the series.

Didn't work. The book is still too long for its substance.

If I knew any transfiguration spells (potions?), I would perform them. I would turn this into the screenplay that, with its short, choppy, plot churning scenes, it so obviously is. More likely, I would turn it into a novel, adding J.K. Rowling's rich description and, more importantly, invention, both of which are lacking here. Using my divination skills, I can foresee a good novel. I can foresee a good movie. I have a hard time foreseeing two satisfying nights of live theater.

That said, there is good stuff here. Good stuff about fathers and sons. Good stuff about unlikely friends. Good stuff about middle aged life. Good stuff about living out someone else's vision for you. Etc. However, with one notable exception--okay, maybe two, #keepthesecrets--none of these human dramas is really embellished by the magical adventures that ensue.

At the end of Deathly Hallows, we jumped ahead 19 years and were led to believe all was well. It's not giving anything away to say that a few more years pass and then it appears that all might not be well. Been there. At this point, I wonder--just like I still wonder how Christmas fits into the wizarding world--what wizard life looks like in the periods between the wars. Is it easy utopia, or does it lend itself to a portrait of suburban discontent and domestic madness as easily as '50s America--or modern America--does? That's the ""what happened next"" story I would rather have seen.

Finally, much has been made about the casting of a black actress to play Hermione. Ignoring for a moment that J.K. Rowling missed an opportunity for the saddest moment in literature by not having the muggle-born Hermione die in the Ministry of Magic--by then, Nazi central--in Deathly Hallows, the unobjectionable casting hardly matters. Hermione, like Ron and Ginny, are just thin sketches of the characters we knew for so long. Harry and Draco fare somewhat better.

I'm glad I read it. I guess I'll see the show if it comes my way. That kind of love, while it may repel a killing curse, shouldn't blind anyone to the problems with this story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

I couldn't help but wondering if it would meet my expectation or be a great disappointment.

Well it was an epic failure on all levles. It was pretty disheartening,  I mean the stroey line was so dry and just very predictable. I knew where it was headed very quicly. There was no mystery or pull to hold the reader other than you hoped it was going to get better but it never did.

Maybe I expected too much or over hyped it in my head. Non the less it was a fantastical diaster my personal feelings. I really felt like she going to over milk the Harry Potter franschies. It felt a little like she use the killing curse on the series at this point."" Avada Kedavra""

Being a big Harry Potter fan and reading all the books as a kid this book kind of take away from the orignial and leaves you more angry than satisfied.

The plot wasn't very good and just left you annoyed. It was very boring and many holes in the story line with a lot of unanswered questions that didn't even needed to be asked. It really makes Harry look stupid in general and just annoys the readers to the end. I stress this  especially if you have read and love the series thus  far.

Its coming to a point where she needs to leave the character alone or shes going to just screw up the whole series if she continues down this road. It did have the potential for greatness tho. She just has to stay away from certain aspect of the old books. She also needs new material not the same old ones recycled. Maybe its just me and I am over judging.

This book was a big let down  in so many so ways plot wise. I really felt like I wasted my time on it, however if you are a fan you are going to most likely want to judge/ read it anyways. I fell like she preys on the fact that you will want to read it no matter what at this point. I recommend if you are going to read it at least borrow it from a friend or library before you commit. Just to form your own opinion.

I am happy I read it, but the whole story was predictable and a very sloppy story line. It wasn't that originally Harry Potter lure. It lasck the pull, mysteries ,fun, and adventure the original books had. It also feels like shes just rewrting the same books only changeing a few deatails.  I wouldn't recommend it but if you are a fan you have to read it for your selves like I said earlier.

It isn't a great disappointment ...read with caution Harry Potter Fans. Its a big let down but now you have a warning so many it wont be so bad.

The whole book was about time travel and sometimes they could travel in time and come close to destroying the world by altering future reality, but sometimes they could do things that should make a bigger difference, but just don't.  Also, it is hard to follow a book about time travel that uses the same or similar names for the second generation children as the adults from the first generation.  It is even more difficult to follow with the unusual play format.  I always found myself wondering if we were seeing the older Harry or the young Harry or Albus Dumbledore or Albus, Harry's son.

There is no excitement, no magic, no feeling. The only reason I have given this book 3 stars is because part four is J.K Rowling writing and you can feel it with every ounch of your body. Part four brings you back to the Harry Potter you grew up loving. I will say no true Harry Potter fan won't cry in part four because of the history behind it. We all have that moment when we wounder about potter and James death and what Harry would do and this bring you to that. I haven't cried like that since Severus killed Dumbledore.

I can't shake the feeling of this being a money-grab however as it wouldn't have taken too much effort to actually write a novel based on this story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

It is much different than the original series. It is obvious Rowling did not write a lot of it. Remember, it was written as a play first, so it is probably a much better play than book (just like the original series are better books than movies). Because it's written for a play, it moves very quickly from scene to scene. As others have noted, the characters are much different. I tried to keep in mind that they are 20 years older so obviously people change and evolve. But a few of the main ones did seem too different from themselves. The first half of the book is pretty bad and it's hard to get used to the new characters and the old characters with their new personalities. But, the end of the book is much better. The moral behind the story follows was Rowling portrayed with the original 7 books. It's still worth the quick read. But just don't expect it to be just like the others, because it's not and I don't think it was supposed to be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

First and foremost, it's the script. A lot of the action, scenery, and setting that are so vitally embedded in Rowling's work are left for you to conjure up for yourself--the stage notes aren't entirely helpful. Furthermore, to be quite honest, it reads more like fan-fiction than a true continuation of the rest of the series. I did expect more, particularly with the understanding that Rowling was part of the writing process. Some of the plot points didn't seem to fit quite right, others seemed very far-fetched even within a world based in magical happenings. More still seemed to be out of character with the characters we know and love, even considering the fact that this is set many years after the series proper concluded.

I enjoyed reading it; it was fun to go through and I'm sure that seeing the play brings the story to its audience in a better way than simply reading the script. If you choose to get and read this, go forward with the understanding that it will be a different experience than the books.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

As a Potter book, 2 stars.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2016","I have been reading (and re-reading) the Harry Potter series for roughly 16 years now, ever since I was eleven. I grew up with the books when they were released, and went to midnight release of Deathly Hallows when I was 18. I feel like I went to Hogwarts and grew up with Harry, Ron and Hermione. These characters are very real to me and very dear to my heart. When I first heard about the Cursed Child back in maybe January or February, I was very wary of it, especially when I found out it was going to be written as a script. As the release grew closer, I got a little more excited about it and decided to preorder it. I knew it would be nowhere near as good as the core series, but I wanted to see what it was all about anyways. When it downloaded onto my Kindle on July 31st, I read it straight through in about 3.5 hours. I couldn't put it down. I found it to be exciting, thrilling, and emotional; I admit I teared up quite a few times. After the initial emotions subsided, I felt a bit empty inside. The easiest way to sum up my overall feelings about the Cursed Chld would be this: it is an excellent stand-alone story and will be undoubtedly great on stage. But, as a Harry Potter story, it's not fantastic by any means, and just does not feel the same, for reasons that have nothing to do with it being a script.

What I Liked:
-Albus being sorted into Slytherin and becoming best friends with Scorpius Malfoy
-Seeing the gang all grown up, and the different struggles that they face as adults, which I could relate to very well
-I thought the time travel and the different outcomes were fun, even if it was not very believable.

What I'm Neutral About
-Voldemort having a child. There's no way it would ever happen or even be possible, but I still thought it was a cool idea to explore.

What I Didn't Like
-The trio's professions. I know this seems minor. But, knowing these characters like I do, Hermione would NEVER accept the position as Minister for Magic. After everything Harry as been through, I find it highly unlikely that he would want to step foot in the Ministry ever again, much less work there. Ron running Weasley's Wizard Wheezes with George is better, but I still don't really agree with it or think it would actually happen.
-There were some inconsistencies when retelling past events, such as the maze in the third task. In the Cursed Child script, the maze is a 'living' maze like in the Goblet of Fire movie. In the Goblet of Fire book, the maze was not like that. It sometimes felt like they were spinning off of the movies instead of the books.
-I missed Hogwarts and wish we could have seen more of it. Besides the characters, the time spent at Hogwarts is my absolute favorite part of the books and I wish we could have seen more of Albus and Scorpius adventures within the castle and throughout their classes.
-What I was most disappointed about, however, is the lack of Rose, James, Victoire, Teddy, etc. I was really looking forward to getting to know the 3rd generation and I was a bit shocked that they weren't more involved.

There is more I could write, such as the dialog and the characters not always being true to themselves, but the above reasons were the hard hitters for me. It was definitely an entertaining story and I will read it again in the future sometime, but to me this is not the 'eighth' Harry Potter book, and something that I will never view as canon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

I'd read reviews first with phrases like fan fiction & wish fulfillment. I also went into it knowing that it was a play, and not written by J.K. Rowling herself.

After I got used to the format. I quite enjoyed it. Scorpius is a new favorite for me, & I quite liked Draco. Harry, however, ticked me off a few times. Ron was a bit more like movie Ron, than book Ron (more bumbling).

The first part was quite a bit more intriguing than the second.

Also, the time turners function completely differently, than they did in Prisoner of Azkaban. The future is affected in the play, in major ways. In the books, nothing changes, what is always was. Big error, in my opinion.

I'd love to see the stage play, but alas, I am an American without the budget.

I know there was a big to-do in London about the stage play, but the format is a poor substitute for a novel, if you're reading. There were no details in the writing: the kind you found on every page and in every sentence of the original Potter books.

I didn't even get a true sense of the characters. And because the format was designed for a finite amount of time on the stage, some characters got short shrift, particularly Ron, who hardly appears at all.

Like most fans of Harry Potter, the idea and possibilities of an 8th entry into the series was always something fun to ponder and discuss. Rowling leaving us with the image of Potter's kids going off to Hogwarts, following in their famous father's footsteps also helped fuel the speculation and fan theories. However, that was one of the most perfect endings in all forms of entertainment. Aside from Breaking Bad, I honestly don't think there was ever a more perfect conclusion to a series.

So when the announcement of The Cursed Child was made a while back, I, as I'm sure many other fans did, felt a sense of excitement, while, at the same time, that nagging worry that, as Hollywood has shown with horrible and unasked for sequels (here's looking at you Zoolander 2 and Dumb and Dumber To), The Cursed Child would be a huge let down.

Thankfully, I can safely say that The Cursed Child in and of itself was not as bad as I feared. The format is definitely odd (we will get to that in a moment), and it's pretty damn obvious that though this is Rowling's concept(s), it is not her voice on paper (also more on that later), the story and overall feel is Harry Potter through and through. The wonder of Hogwarts still exisits, the dark magic of Voldemort and his death eaters still permeates and gives the story the dark feelings of the later entries into the series, and Albus and Scorpious aren't necessarily as strong and Harry and his friends, but together they make a good team; ones you can't help but root for, even if Albus is a huge ass brat most of the time. It's also an incredibly fast and easy read (I read this in 2 days, while in the midst of one of the busiest and hectic weeks of 2016), which should come as no surprise since pretty much all of the Harry Potter books are that way.

I just wish that Rowling and everyone else involved would have chosen to go down the normal, safe path and publish this as a novel instead of the script format. I have no problem with the idea of doing the entire thing in a play production. In fact, I think that's actually a pretty cool idea, especially now at a time when things like Hamilton are all the rage. The problem, however, is that it completely fails when translated to the page. Maybe it's because I've never been a big fan of the stage, or had any interest in being an actor, but whatever the case, trying to read Harry Potter in strictly dialogue and stage direction wasn't what I would call easy. Unlike a novel that flows together in paragraphs and sentences, a page of speaking instructions and commands to actors is jarring and takes the reader out of the story. I'm not saying it doesn't work (go read Shakespeare's Star Wars to see what I mean), I just don't think it did here. Don't get me wrong, I think this would look absoleuylt beautiful on the stage in London, but it sure doesn't look beautiful when you're trying to read it.

And while it's true that Rowling's fingerprints are all over The Cursed Child, I don't think she was the one that did any of the actual writing. It was like she gave Jack Thorne and John Tiffany an outline and let them have at it. While the dialogue between characters is clever and realistic, the feel is gone. I don't know if that makes much sense, but when reading this, there never seemed to be any of Rowling's original touch. Not that I'm totally blaming her (she has the Cormoran Strike series to write, a movie to produce, and a personal life to live), but without her at the helm of the writing process, it shows.

I really wanted to give The Cursed Child 4 stars, and I very nearly did. The problem is that in all honesty I couldn't. Of course it was better than expected in the story part, and the twist at the end, had I not accidentally read about it before, was one of the better ones I can remember in recent memory, however that can't be overlooked by the disinteresting format and the absence of Rowling herself. Not that my review is gonna stop sales, however. The book is already a worldwide bestseller and on track to be England's fastest selling book of all time. Not to mention tickets for the play are coming in at upwards of 1,500 bucks. So in that regard, it's still a rousing success.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

So many people are giving it 1 star because they thought this was a book, not a script.  Lack of knowledge/awareness shouldnt be reflected in the scores.

That being said, this book isnt great.  It was enjoyable at times but there were way too many issues.

For one, there was no character development.  And I understand that this is hard to accomplish in a play format but its definitely possible.  As a huge Harry Potter fan, I just didnt feel a connection to any of the characters.  Few, if any, felt authentic to the Harry Potter universe that we know.  I thought they butchered Ron's character more than any.

The plot holes though are the main issue.  Not only was the plot rushed, but quite frankly at times it didnt make sense....even directly conflicting with things that we know(?) to be true from the original 7 books.  I won't go in to detail as I want to avoid spoilers but it was very clunky, awkward and forced.

In the end, I based this review on the way the book left me feeling. It definitely left something to be desired.  There is no questioning that.  Even with all of it's huge flaws it had its touching and funny moments and made me smile.  I will likely never read this book again but I also dont regret reading it.  It didnt take away from the previous 7 or ruin the legacy in any way. Give it a shot.  Pick up a copy, give it a read.  Don't listen to all of the negative reviews.  You're allowed to love it.  You're allowed to hate it.  And you're allowed to ""medium"" it like me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews","3 people found this helpful"

I could interpret things better and give it a more magical feel that it deserved. Albus and Scorpius had a wonderful relationship and I was happy to see it.
But the book felt...recycled. The whole first chapter was just rehashing the epilogue from the Deathly Hallows and I felt like the characters were just echoing things that they said in previous books. The characters didn't come alive or feel fully developed.

Doubting that most Potter fans read plays often, this play might be something they dislike. The story telling is alright. The characters don't truly grow until the last few pages, and the direction is very very limited. This is not as immersive as the books in any way. The structure of each writer is fairly easy to pick out, and a lot of it feels bland.
All that being said the play was ok. It felt like a good introduction to higher level play reading, which is good for the younger generation of Harry Potter fans.

I really, really, really wanted to love it. But there were too many things that really bugged me. I will say, I did think the relationship with Harry and Albus was understandable: having to live up to your dad's reputation probably sucked. And Scorpius was definitely my favorite character, as well as how Draco was handled. I don't think anything about Ron in this book was like the Ron we've all read about since we were kids, and that was incredibly disappointing- since, you know, he's one of the core characters!- and hard to get past. Ron and Hermione's kids were hardly mentioned, as were two out of three of Harry's. One thing that really irked me was that Hagrid was not mentioned AT ALL as his present self, only in flashbacks to Harry as a baby and getting him from the Dursley's. Do they really think Hagrid was just not important anymore? Did he just leave Hogwarts? I wanted to see at least a little bit of Hagrid, as well as all the other Weasley's--how is George doing? And some things about the alternate reality just did not sound believable in terms of the characters. So it was nice to sort of revisit this world that I've loved so much over the years, but I was totally fine with putting this book down and back on the shelf when I finished it instead of that little pang in my heart when I finished the others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_142?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=142&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

Al-salem","Enjoyable, but had MAJOR issues with it. Review by a die-hard fan.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","Let me start by saying Harry Potter is basically my life. I was 11 years old when the first movie came out (Just as old as Harry in the movie,
coincidentally). I have re-read each book atleast 5-6 times, in addition to almost memorizing the movies line for line. Harry Potter is a part of my life and soul, has been and forever will be. Now, on to the review:

!!! Spoiler Alert !!! You have been warned !!!!!

The story has one huge major issue: Time-Turners.
Over and over, it has been established in the Harry Potter verse that Time-Turners can't take you way back in time. A solid concrete rule right?? Don't believe me? This is from JK Rowling on Pottermore.com about Time-Turners: ""The longest period that may be relived without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself is around five hours. All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved."" See, told you, a CONCRETE rule.

WRONG. Suddenly out of nowhere, a death eater was able to ""make"" a Time-Turner that goes back years. WHAT?????? Do you understand what the ramifications of this are ??? Yet, in the Cursed Child, they use the Time-Turner constantly, going back and forth in time with no consequence :O This made struggle so hard with the credibility of the story and it quite honestly felt like (poor) fan fiction :O Which it is, to a degree, since the script was penned by Jack Thorne, not Rowling herself. I really question how much Jo was actually involved in the story and cant for the life of me understand why she approved it. The whole plot revolves around the (broken) Time-Turner plot device. I could go on and on about the inconsistencies with regards to the time travel in the Cursed Child, but I digress (for more: check out Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which set the rules for time travel).

  Second, and this is a BIG one: Voldemort had a daughter with Bellatrix Lestrange. WHATTT?????????
It says in the book that she was born in Malfoy Manor just before the Battle of Hogwarts. Did every death eater/ Malfoy living at Malfoy Manor not know this??? Really? No one cared to mention that they saw/noticed/heard that Bellatrix Lestrange was pregnant/gave birth ? REALLY??? And who took care of her all these years (shes twenty-something in Present day) and taught her magic ?? It felt like a huge hole that didnt make any sense at all.

 Third issue I had, the dialogue sometimes felt a bit off-character for our beloved trio (especially Ron which became like a copy of Fred and George) and the characters sometimes saying cheesy things which felt REALLY odd. It really exemplified the fact that script was not written by our beloved Jo Rowling.

Fourth, dragging Cedric Diggory through the mud and saying he can turn into a death eater because of humiliation at the Triwizard tournament (This one made me laugh and gave me a good chuckle actually). Sigh. Not even going to explain this one.

So you see, even though I mildly enjoyed this entry into the Potter series, I did have some problems with the narrative, which I'm not used to with the past HP books. But hey, at least its an update on our favourite Trio and where they are in life and the occasional humor. Am grateful for that, at least.

Thank You for reading.

Retzlaff","A Bit of a Disappointment","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","I have been a Potterhead for years and have been looking forward to this publication for some time. Jo Rowling has been pestered by fans for years to continue Harry's story and let us know how their lives continued after Deathly Hallows ended, and this book does give us that much.  While this story may make a spectacular play, the book is a bit of a disappointment. It was nice to visit old friends, but their characters are mere shadows of everything that made the original series a blockbuster.  Rowling has said that the actual performance is much more fleshed out than the script; but sadly, many of us will probably never have the opportunity or means to see it. Although I felt this book was lacking, I am stop glad that I read it, although $14.95 (or more for the print version) is a bit steep for what you get.

Ronke","Probably better on the stage","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","Cursed Child is an entertaining story, though the pace of reading a script doesn't exactly resemble reading a novel. All the magic of JKR's wizard universe is a little harder to find here, since nearly everything is dialogue. I imagine the stagecraft would make up for it.
The plot contains some surprises, but if you can excuse somewhat of a spoiler, a significant portion just feels like Back to the Future II. The handling of time travel in the play is not as tight as what we saw in Prisoner of Azkaban, and it occasionally felt like a retread of Harry's Greatest Hits.
I like that the primary characters, Albus and Scorpius, weren't just younger copies of their parents. I think the exploration of parenting and living up to parental expectations could be quite moving with the right cast.
Overall, it's nice to be back reading Potter again. Reading Cursed Child was like attending my High School reunion. It's great to catch up with these old friends, but we're all going to be relieved when it's time to go home.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

However, it was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. I will start off by saying I do miss the original novel composition of the Harry Potter books. I also felt that like other reviewers mentioned, this should have been written by J.K. Rowling and Rowling alone. Having two other writers contribute to this book tainted it in a way that you didn't feel as much of the magic as you did when you read the original 7 Harry Potter books. I could easily feel which parts of this script Rowling had most likely written and which parts she did not. When I found myself most absorbed and familiar with the characters and surroundings, I could sense J.K. Rowling's involvement. Other parts of the book, the characters didn't quite sound like the one's we all had come to originally know and love in this novel's predecessors. Like the majority of readers, I grew up with the books as well as with the films. So, I could not not read this book, nor could I put it down once I started reading it. What I did enjoy about this book most was where Severus Snape was involved. He has been my ultimate favorite since ""always."" Not only that, but I loved that I could feel and imagine very clearly the Snape as was portrayed by the late Alan Rickman in the films. I could hear his dry sarcasm so perfectly. The only thing that was odd to imagine was Snape calling Ron and Hermione by their first names. As for Delphi (WARNING: SPOILER), it was very predictable that her mother was only non other than Bellatrix Lestrange. I knew it from the moment I found out Voldemort reproduced. So overall, while I enjoyed some portions of this version of Harry Potter, I found other parts to be predictable and not all quite original (thanks to those other two contributing writers). I give it 3 out of 5 stars because I did enjoy it. It wasn't my favorite HP book, but if you are a true Harry Potter fan, it's impossible to give it complete thumbs down review, only because well, it is Harry Potter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

My advice is read it, but don't expect it to be like the others.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_152?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=152&reviewerType=all_reviews","One person found this helpful"

There was too much jumping around. I didn't really care for any the characters except for Scorpius, which is sad. I wanted to like them, but every single one of them seemed to have drank from the ""I'm so self-obsessed I can't see things from anyone else's point of view."" Scorpius was the only one  I really cared for. I liked him from the beginning. I am with others in feeling that this read more of wish fulfillment fan fiction.

Plays are always fast reads, and reading a play while catching up with four or five of your most magical childhood friends cannot possibly be considered a waste of time. HPCC, however, is not going to appease readers who are expecting:

(A) any form/genre of literature that isn't a play and
(B) anything that truly/significantly alters the ""canon"" story line that was left behind by Years 1-7 and the Deathly Hallows epilogue.

These points are meant to provide the basic parameters of what can even begin to be considered reasonable expectations for this anticipated addition to Rowling's wizarding world. Without these caveats in mind, it would be difficult for anyone to read HPCC without feeling uncomfortably surprised, understandably betrayed, or immeasurably disappointed.

I bring up Caveat (A) because I am reasonably confident that there are/will be a solid fraction of Cursed Child readers and buyers (at least among Americans) that will dive in completely ignorant to the fact that it is, in fact, a play. Those within this demographic who are also without any play acting/reading experience will (probably) feel confused and betrayed.

Being a play, readers should also remember that JK Rowling is explicitly credited with the story. Jack Thorne, a seasoned writer of works for the stage, silver screen, and TV was a major influence on (at least) the shape of majority of the dialogue and stage directions. Writing a novel for readers and writing a play for theatergoers are, obviously, unique literary conquests. We should all be thankful that Rowling was gracious/modest enough to collaborate with an experienced playwright.

Caveat (B), without venturing into spoiler territory, is, in my eyes, essentially true. The Harry Potter plot line and characters that millions of us know and love are not disrespected or desecrated in any fashion. Whether or not their nostalgia factor is shamelessly exploited at points in the play is the more pressing matter up for serious debate. The sacred texts remain sacred. No crusades, inquisitions, or jihads necessary. The canon story line that was left behind by Years 1-7 and the Deathly Hallows epilogue remains, within reason, untouched and unaltered.

Measured up against the world-altering developments wrought by the end of every Year 1-7 novel, little progress is made in Cursed Child. Beyond an old folks home for wizards, there are no new locales or revelations of any lasting in-world impact this time around in the wizarding world. That's not to say that fans are not rewarded with more subtle glimpses into the relationships between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and their children decades after Deathly Hallows.

The Cursed Child is at its strongest when it digs into these relationships. If HPCC suffers from anything, it is from not offering enough of these character-based nuances to readers. That being said, other readers and myself must remember that this is a play. A play meant to be performed by actresses and actors that will lend layers of emotion and physicality to these lines and characters that can only fully manifest themselves on the stage. If the dialogue reads as ""flat"", ""unlike these characters"", or otherwise ""off"", it because a plays are ultimately meant to be experienced as performances, not texts.

Other possible complaints will include:
- Why did it have to be a play?
- Why isn't (X) character in the play?
- Why does HPCC read like fan fiction?
- Why is it a play?

These are all interesting questions if fans and literary scholars are legitimately interested in exploring them, but unfortunately, more often than not they will just remain unfounded complaints; empty thoughts that give readers an excuse to trash a play for being a play or will serve as an attempt to place their own fan fictive imaginations and would-be realities on a pedestal. I'm not saying everyone will feel like this, but looking over other Goodreads and Amazon reviews I know that many do or will. Me? I say go into reading Cursed Child expecting a fun few hours. Go into the theater to see Cursed Child expecting your mind to be blown. The latter situation will be the truly level playing field for work and audience alike.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Naturally I was excited — because it’s Harry freakin’ Potter — but I also just didn’t quite feel as excited as I thought I should be. Before picking up the bound version of the play (since I guess we really shouldn’t be calling it a book as it was never intended to be an actual book), I knew there were a few things that were hindering my excitement that I ultimately expected to affect my overall enjoyment of the experience (and in fact, they all did play a part in that). I knew that J.K. Rowling was involved in the plot and creation of CURSED CHILD, but ultimately, it was not her writing on the page. I knew that I was going to be reading a rehearsal script for the play and that the formatting might throw off my experience. And I knew that I’d be reading about adult Harry, Ron, Hermione, and company and I didn’t know if I’d like where their characters were in their adult lives since we had some pretty cheesy things happen in the epilogue of DEATHLY HALLOWS, and that actually was J.K. Rowling’s writing.

The short version of this review is that CURSED CHILD was kind of all over the place for me. The overall plot was interesting and I really, really loved certain parts but other parts of it just seemed so… I guess amateur is the best word I can think of at the moment, although that seems quite harsh. We’ve grown to love J.K. Rowling’s stories and how detailed they are and there were just certain things about CURSED CHILD that didn’t seem like they were plotted out very well. Other parts seemed completely random and totally uncharacteristic of the series. The overall concept of this story of the next generation was a really interesting concept but seemingly poorly executed. This was like cramming multiple books into one book (or I suppose, one play) and concepts were sort of flying all over the place. It was really fun to see things from the original series turn up but other times, the references back to the original series was very cheesy or just plain inaccurate. Small inaccuracies in some parts (it was “Happee Birthdae” not “Happy Birthday”), and some big timeline disagreements in others but it’s Harry freakin’ Potter. You don’t think the fandom will pick up on these? (They totally did.) It was just things like that that really made me feel like this was sloppily put together and that these playwrights who put the CURSED CHILD play together were missing some really core feelings and elements of the series.

I knew that I was going to be reading a script when I started and it was definitely a unique experience but I think the format lost a LOT in translation. There was less atmosphere, less dialogue, and less development which obviously you’ll get through the actors of the play and you won’t see in a rehearsal script. I just felt like I lost so much not READING those reactions, nuances, tone of voice, sensory descriptions — I mean, really a little of everything that brings the world of Harry Potter to life. Some of that is included in the script notes but the atmosphere is greatly lost because of the format. I mean, obviously this was specifically adapted for a play and that’s how they wanted to tell this story… But I really, really wish it had been developed into an actual book instead of just giving us the rehearsal script. There was so much more of this story to tell! Things would have been a lot less cheesy if they had been developed or explained. (Although some things I’ll never get over. They were just weird.) Everything felt really, really rushed and I would have rather had a simpler plot with more development instead of bursting from scene to scene. There was no time to really absorb anything and that also left very little room for character development. I don’t care if we already know the majority of these characters — they still need to have a personality.

I also didn’t feel like the characters were well-represented at all. Part of it may be because they’re so much older… But a lot of them felt far off from their younger counter-parts (although I’ve changed exponentially since I was 17 so… fair enough in some respects) but I hated that Ron came off the way he did. He was such a lump and a putz with little personality and he was essentially was Hermione’s lesser half. Hermione was a stronger personality, as she usually is, but I feel like even she lost a lot of her logic and wisdom… How do you LOSE wisdom over the years? Harry was always a bit all over the place for me so that was about the same and Ginny was a total movie Ginny, not book Ginny. (Ugh.) The main adult characters (the aforementioned) seemed so stiff and one-dimensional which is hard to bear after spending a full series with them, reading the series multiple times, and watching the movies over and over. We know these characters. They are our childhood. They are our friends. We grew up with them. To see them underdeveloped and misrepresented in a sequel like this just felt so uncaring. There were also a few characters from the series who make appearances (though I won’t reveal who they were) and some were AWESOME and some were confusing, to say the least.
There was a weird sexual tension between the Albus and Scorpius (which I thought was just me at first but there are tons of THINGS all over Buzzfeed and Tumblr about this so I’m not alone) and I honestly thought it was going to be revealed that one had a crush on the other, or that they both shared romantic feelings. That would have been fine expect for the fact that it didn’t happen and I was confused by them always bringing up hugging and the deep friendship feelings which when described really sounded like something more than just a deep platonic friendship bond.

It was so great to see the future for Harry Potter but I just really feel a little let down by a short story. Some of it was so much fun. Parts made me cry. Some made me laugh. But I also had moments where I scratched my head, questioned a lot, and even laughed out loud (not in a good way). Some of it was suuuuper cheesy and I can see why people said it read as fanfic. Overall, it felt messy and rushed and the more I think about it and discuss it, the more I realize that I’m more disappointed than excited about the development. I would have loved to see this really developed in a novel or in a series. We needed so much more time with Albus to understand him a little better. I would have loved to see this great friendship between the two boys and their complicated friendship with Rose (oh, and don’t get me started about her role in the end of the book. An even cheesier way to wrap things up. Yay). I always love more time at Hogwarts. I would have loved to see those little clues along the way to the big reveal. I was okay with what the plot WAS (except for some parts) but it really just needed way more development. I kind of feel like if it can’t be done well, best to leave it alone, and I don’t think CURSED CHILD did justice to this series at all.

We did beg for an eighth book though… so I guess beggars can’t be choosers?

But now can we beg for an Ilvermorny series, pretty please?

Not a best selling Rowling book to me, but a good book nonetheless.
I like the dynamic friendship between the boys. I like the new friendship and angle on their fathers. I really dislike the first few parts of the book. While I am aware it is a screenplay there wasn't enough details about what happened in the boys' lives to cause Albus to feel how he felt. I see many ways the story could have been edited here and there to make it one of The Potter books we love.
Honestly I loved the girl (those who have read the book know who's child I speak of.)
I enjoyed her plot and the end of the book (last 28 to 30 pages) alot.

Although the JK her self has stated that it is canon. If the sorry was actually written by her, in her style, and as a regular book I think my opinion would be different.

This is written to be a play and plays have time constraints. You have to tell as much story as you can in the shortest amount of time.

Thing are rushed and we miss out on a lot. We didn't get a lot of character development. At least not as much as we are used to. We had so much time to get to know everyone in the main series. This is rushed but that is indicative of the medium.

I loved the first seven Harry Potter books, but when this one came out, I had mixed feelings about reading it. My main concern was that the book was written in a play format. I really prefer reading novels. I love the description that you are able to get in novels. A play feels really sterile, especially when you are just reading it. When my son gave me the book, I decided that it was time to read it.

The story takes place nineteen years after the events in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. We meet up with Harry and Ginny, and their three children (James, Lily and Albus), and Ron and Hermione and their child Rose. It is Albus' first year at Hogwarts. He immediately bonds with Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco, especially when both are sorted into Slytherin. Scorpius and Albus both have problems fitting in at Hogwarts, and dealing with their father's reputations.

I enjoyed the basic story. When characters from the previous books were brought back for what are essentially cameos, I felt a wave of nostalgia. It was a bit sad to see Harry beaten down by the bureaucracy of his job. He seems very middle aged and not so much a hero anymore. I have heard that this is a great play to watch on stage. I hope I get the chance to do that some day. I would also like it if the book could be rewritten as a novel. You really need to have read the first seven books to get the most out of this one. Fans of the series should enjoy revisiting Hogwarts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_138?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=138&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Perhaps this is because this is a script intended for stage production with effects that I cannot catch from the book (and also intended for younger age audience), but the pace is quite fast while I do not quite see the character development I saw in the original series.

Hughes","If only...","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2016","Although the story had potential I think first of all keeping it in script form was a mistake.  I didn't mind it so much but it seems many other readers had a problem with it.  Next, to give Voldemort a ""love"" child was a stretch, I think he was as repulsed by the notion  of physical love as Sheldon Cooper and anyone he'd deemed worthy to carry his heir would most certainly been less in battle and more in hiding.

Voldemort wouldn't have sired an heir anyway as he'd already planned his immortality, and it wasn't in any way going to be vicariously done.  A hapless minion who felt cheated of a promised station, such as Lucious Malfoy would have been more believable.  Lucious would have been desperate to re-elevate the Malfoy name and redeem himself to the Dark Lord and taken great satisfaction in destroying Harry Potter's past and future to do so.

While I enjoyed revisiting old friends I have to say it felt like they had some other engagement and had rushed the visit.  Indeed such an event merited a two part series but in separate books with a bit more character development and a cliff hanger at the end of the first book.  J.K. Rowling should have followed her original formula and banged out a story on her own and then allowed a playwright artistic license.

Indeed, thank you for the story, and do come again, only this time when you can stay longer and be more at home.

Best wishes,

Although I also read other books, I reread the HP books continually.  When I first got a new HP book I couldn't put it down until I got to the end.  I'm struggling after three days to finish this cursed play.  I agree with another reviewer.  I'm just not feeling JK in this writing.  It seems more like some unknown trying to continue the HP saga and coming up very short.  The story is fanciful in a far fetched way.  The adult characters come across as strangers to me.  This is not a good way to end Harry.  I hope JK reconsiders and gives us one of her own tales in which to say good bye to Harry and his friends.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

The basis of the 7 book series was that what made Harry special was that even after his difficult childhood, he was empathetic, kind, thoughtful, etc. Now we are to believe that because he didn't grow up with a father that he is unable to be a good father to his younger son. We are not given enough background to make that in any way believable. I can’t accept this as canon. Another issue is that the familiar characters don’t ‘sound like’ themselves. I was particularly disappointed that Ron was portrayed as a caricature of himself, even more so than he was on screen.  Also, whereas JK Rowling was masterful at writing children, these authors are not.  If you can put all that aside, the story is interesting and suspenseful. Based on the stage direction, the stage production sounds even more entertaining than the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_144?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=144&reviewerType=all_reviews","2 people found this helpful"

However, it wasn't how I would want the future of the characters from the original books to turn out. I was especially disappointed with Harry's behavior. Although it is based on a story by JK Rowling, I'm going to treat this like a fan fiction story- as something that might have happened in the future but not necessarily the ""real"" story.
I won't spoil the details, but the play begins where the books ended, with Harry's son Albus leaving for his first year at Hogwarts. The story then rapidly moves ahead several years to the main adventure. The plot revolves around time travel and how changing the past can mess alter the present. This has been explored from Star Trek to Johnny Test and will be the focus of the upcoming series ""Timeless"". Overall I think it was well done in this case.

Richard","OK, but Had Hoped for More","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2018","In this book, we are returned to the world of Harry Potter many years after the last novel. Potter and his friends are now grown up and even running things in some cases. The characters are faced with a new, yet familiar problem - I won't spoil it by giving details here.

The book was OK, but I was a little disappointed. I had hoped for more, especially given how long it had been since the last Harry Potter novel.

Maybe it was the play format instead of the novel format that I was used to for a Potter story. Seemed like something was missing making it hard to visualize the story in my head. If watching a play, the actors supply this missing element I guess.

In any case, the story just seemed to plod along. The characters seemed rather flat. The story itself seemed a little shallow. It was nice to see some favorite characters again, at least in some form.

One thing I noted was how much blank paper there was in this book. Seems they could have been a little less wasteful in formatting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews","null"

Rowling created. The first HP book was published in the US when I was in 6th grade and the same age as Harry. My mom, a children’s librarian at the time, saw the book at the Scholastic Book Fair. (Remember those? I hope they still have them!)

She, sensing this book was going to be great, picked it up and gave it to me. As a 6th grader, I felt too grown up for what looked like a kid’s book, so it sat for a few months on my bedside table (which doubled as a bookcase). Then, one night, I couldn’t sleep. I’d finished whatever book I was reading and had nothing else lined up. It was very late and I was getting desperate. So I grabbed the closest book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, and started reading. And did not stop until I finished the book. My first-ever all-nighter!

The next year, when the second book came out, I was in England. At that time, the books were published in the UK long before they came out in the US. All my classmates got to read the book when I returned from my trip, months before it finally came out in our country. I was super popular for a while.

The following year, my mom was in Scotland and found the third book. After that, they started publishing the books at the same time in different countries. And my family stopped travelling to the UK. By that time, the damage was done. I was completely hooked on Harry Potter.

Needless to say, when the series ended, I was devastated. Of course I wanted to know how it was all going to end, but I didn’t want it to end.
So years later, when I learned about this play, I started to feel some of that old excitement again.

Now, let me preface my review with the assurance that I knew I was getting a script and not a novel. I have a degree in Theater as well as English, so I knew what I was getting into.

When you read a play, you have to create a lot of the atmosphere yourself. Rowling does an amazing job of this in her novels, but you don’t have that luxury when reading a script. The stage directions will give you some clues, but for the most part, it is up to you to imagine the story.

With that said, this play must be a visual phenomenon. There is a production credit for “Illusions and Magic” (and an “Illusions and Magic Associate”). The directions and some of the lines make it obvious this play is visually astounding. (The old stage manager in me would love to see this play from a technical perspective).

However, my beef with this play is twofold: 1. the story and 2. the characters.

First, the story. As many other people have said before me, the plot of the play reads like fanfiction and not as something from the mind of Rowling.

Using time-travel as a plot device seems lazy. There was a reason Rowling had all the time-turners destroyed in the fifth book. Using time travel to solve your problems every time wouldn’t work (perhaps with the exception of Doctor Who). On the other hand, I can see how Voldemort’s supporters would feel they have no other option except to go back in time and change things. Even wizards and witches can’t bring people back from the dead. But using an illegal time-turner felt like a cop-out to me. Surely Rowling could have come up with a better plot device than time travel?

I am of a divided mind when it comes to the characters. Of course I am basing this solely on their lines and my imagination of how the actors would perform their parts. Perhaps I would feel differently if I were to actually watch the play. Regardless, I was sorely disappointed in one of my favorite literary characters ever: Ron Weasley. In the novels, Ron is a deeply flawed person with an enormous sense of humor. Some of his lines in the books still make me laugh out loud when I read them (”…wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby’s tea cozy” comes to mind). In the play, Ron’s lines were cringe-inducing attempts at Rowling’s seemingly effortless style of writing dialogue. He just plain wasn’t funny.

Rose was rude and a bully, but I could see where she got that from her father, who was certainly not the nicest child at times. Albus was annoying, but that just showed he took after his father as a teenager. Speaking of Harry, he was very disappointing as a parent and not at all what I imagined…Parenting is rough, but for someone who grew up without his, you’d think he’d try harder to be the best father he could.

And don’t get me started on Delphi…

For one thing, I desperately did not need the image of Voldy getting it on with Bellatrix, tyvm. For another, it was just too much of a stretch for me to imagine Voldemort having a child. Just didn’t fit the character I remembered from the books.

Other characters were not nearly as disappointing. Like most folks, I particularly enjoyed Scorpius. There were a few good lines from Hermione, another favorite character of mine, even though I wasn’t overly happy with how she was portrayed.

To sum up:
Plot: meh
Characters: mixed
Reliving HP happiness: hooray!

Now I need to plan another trip to London so I can see the play and completely change my mind about the entire thing…","3.0 out of 5 stars","","","2 people found this helpful"

This story is 90% dialogue (again, play), which makes for a quick read but also left me feeling a great lack of satisfaction.  I was happy for another HP installment, but I found this story seriously lacking in creativity and oomph.  The characters also didn't seem like themselves.  Harry was kind of an a-hole, Ron had more wit and balls than normal, Ginny was bold and talkative, Malfoy did a complete 180, and Hermione wasn't quite snarky enough.

The plot is flimsy, the writing is awful, and Chekov's gun really doesn't bother to hide itself. But, honestly, it's so bad it's hilarious.

If you were on Fanfiction for Harry Potter circa early to mid 2000s, this screenplay is a walk down memory lane, laced with nostalgia-- down to the script format that was eventually banned from fanfiction websites!

If not, you are in for a HUGE disappointment. I can only assume that JKR had no role in the actual writing of this play, and merely edited afterwards-- the tone and basis are absolutely nothing like her previous works. This story is very, very much a comedy that attempts to be serious every now and then, but rarely succeeds.

Overall, absolutely hilarious and almost a parody of the Harry Potter franchise itself... but if you don't care to spend $15-18 on an official sh*tpost, ""My Immortal"", the infamous fanfiction, will do the same for free.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Parts/product-reviews/133821666X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_135?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=135&reviewerType=all_reviews","33 people found this helpful"
