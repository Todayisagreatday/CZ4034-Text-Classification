Rowling demonstrates an impressive ability to bring her magical world vividly to the imagination of her audience. I also expect that it makes an excellent play that I hope someday to be able to see. This  was a fine book and a good play. However, it was disappointing as a new installment of the Harry Potter Saga. Now, it is hard to fault Rawling for this, as my objection really boils down to her previous work simply being TOO good. It would be hard for any book, much less a play, to hold up to my expectations and unfortunately this play did not.

Below are some of my concerns, to name but a few <Spoilers from here on out>:

The utilization of the time turner trope, unsurprisingly, opens up a large number of plot holes (how do the effects of manipulating the blanket propagate forward without other effects, like there being an Albus and Scorpius or Delphi's machinations; why can't someone at any point in the future make a new unlimited time turner and render all futures unfixed etc.).

Many of the portrayals of characters are disappointing to those of us who grew up with them (the idea that counterfactually Diggory could become a death eater, that Professor Longbottom would not have a more active role at Hogwarts in dealing with the situation, that Harry's scar could start hurting (despite the Horcrux in him being destroyed) is deeply implausible).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I won't compare this to the original series, because that'd be like trying to compare anything with perfection in my world. There were some things that did bother me about this book though, which I'll get to in a bit.

I'll start with what I liked:
It has been nine years since the last Harry Potter book came out, in which I stood in line dressed as Luna Lovegood nervously avoiding everything in fear of spoilers, and as a die-hard fan I loved the excuse to return to a world I almost feel that I grew up in. I liked reading this play because I've always been eager for more Harry, and this gave me more Harry.
I actually thought it worked well as a play, too. Plays/scripts will by virtue of their format not be able to offer as much detail and description as a book might, especially when reading a script vs seeing it as it was meant to be seen. But GIVEN that it's a play and that has to be expected, I appreciated the description that was included. There was enough in there for me to smile along with a new favorite character (Scorpius) and I definitely cried at the end, but I cry at a lot of things, so take that with a grain of salt.

And the things I DIDN'T like are more because of that die-hard HP fan thing, but I'll give an overview anyway:
Some of the plot points in this book just don't WORK, given the story's previous canon. I won't go into too much detail, because spoilers, but trolley witches? A certain office that seemed far too easy to get into? A kind of major relationship that seems much too far-fetched to ever be considered reality in this universe? I don't know. I just kept pausing while reading this and thinking, but, wait, THAT'S a bit contradictory.

I don't know if I'll return to re-read this many times, but I have no regrets about my midnight trek to buy it among my fellow book-lovers, and I will probably still see the play if given the chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Springer","Great, Smooth Read. Genuinely Entertaining.","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2016","I don't understand these 1-2 star ratings, I really don't. I thoroughly enjoyed this script book. It might not have been on par with the original Harry Potter series, but it was good in its own right. The pacing was smooth for me, even if it moved a little fast in the beginning. But this isn't a novel, it's supposed to be made into a play. Which is why I understand the pacing and not going into huge details about each year.

[spoiler]Being a Slytherin myself, I love that Albus was sorted into the greatest house and made quick friends with Scorpius. He struggled with the placement, but came to realize it was were he belonged in the end.[/spoiler]

I was hooked on this from the first page and finished it within the second day of owning it. I grew up with Harry Potter, but I wasn't overly excited for this script book since it isn't an actual novel. But it was a pleasant read and I'd recommend it to any fan of the series. Definitely a great insight into what our favorite characters have been up to since leaving Hogwarts.

Harry's childhood was not easy and it appears that his son Albus is following in his footsteps.  Albus is sorted into an unexpected house at Hogwarts and his best friend is Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's longtime enemy Draco.  Albus has long struggled with being the son of the famous Harry Potter, but this time his struggles will put him - and those closest to him - in very real danger.

I admit that I had mixed feelings about buying “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”, knowing it was a play and not a book, and - while was based on her ideas - it was not written by J.K. Rowling.  After reading it, I still have mixed feelings.  To be sure, the story is a good one with Albus struggling in his father's footsteps just as Harry struggles to be a good father (as he says at one point he did not have any good examples to follow growing up).  Albus's friendship with Scorpius is well done - I never thought I would like a character whose last name is Malfoy but Scorpius is delightful - in fact, I think he is the real star of the play.  Besides the expected Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, many old favorites appear in this play (some briefly) and there are some poignant and scary moments.  But in the end, this is a play not a book and lacks some of the character development that was in the books. Albus and Harry's relationship is realistically done but I would have liked to have seen more of James and how Albus gets along with him.  Classroom action is pretty much nonexistent in the play.  I found that the play, which is split into two part and is meant to be seen on two separate nights, is overlong (so much dialogue for the actors to learn, especially the young ones!) and feels like it could have used some editing (perhaps with some of the alternate worlds in the play).  I was never bored while reading the play; it just seemed a long play to be sitting in the audience watching.  Having said that, I would certainly go see the play just to see how they pulled off some of the magic - I bet it is awesome to see in person!

“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is not as good as any of the books in the series, but Harry Potter fans will enjoy it if only to see what Harry, Hermione, and Ron are like as adults.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I went into it with an open mind and realized that the play itself was based on a story and not directly written by J.K. Rowling. I felt that it was quite fast moving and I did miss the rich full detail of the original series, but I understand clearly that this is a play, just the dialogue that misses the richness that is filled in by the visuals of watching a play in person. Additionally this wasn't a complex novel, it is the script of a play so the long meandering conversations and slowly developing story that I love about the original books was definitely missing. Again, I don't count this against the play because that is just not what a play is.

I found myself filling in a lot of the missing bits with my own visuals in my head. After having read the books so very many times, J.K. Rowling's original descriptions left me a wonderful imaginative landscape to watch this story play out in. I think as a free standing play without the knowledge and history of Hogwarts, the wizarding world and the characters themselves, this probably comes up short. As a piece of the Harry Potter universe, it was a fun jaunt through nostalgia and I actually found the plot to be unexpected and entertaining.

I read the play for entertainment and I definitely got what I was looking for. If you're looking for a significant addition to the Harry Potter novels akin to another book, you will be disappointed. If you're looking to read the script to a play that tells an interesting story about the goings on of several familiar characters and how life has changed since the original books, then this is a fun read with surprises, laughs, and lots of nostalgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_169?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=169&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I really enjoyed it and I read it straight through completely captivated but also what the hell did I just read? The storyline itself was a little strange and almost read like fanfiction. It wasn't what I expected at all but it was entertaining enough to keep my attention and I really wanted to see how it ended.

As for characters I really enjoyed Albus and Scorpius. They're friendship was amazing and I would read many more books about them. I also enjoyed the interactions between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. There where times when I wasn't a huge fan of the way they acted but they did come off as true to character. Delphi was a very interesting character and I'm not sure how I felt about that or her.

This is not exactly how I thought the trio and their children would end up, and I have many of my own headcanons for how I wanted things to be. While this book doesn't follow any of my own wants it was still a wonderful story.

As a whole I really enjoyed reading about these characters and their world again. I would definitely want to see the play preformed if I ever had the chance.

Skimpy in detail, and loaded with theateresque, dramatic dialogue (which again, is what I was expecting). That being said, I think this script book told a good story. It took me about 4 hours to read, and I didn't want to put it down. If the average, diehard, HP fan reads this book with realistic expectations, I think he or she may find it enjoyable. The one thing I didn't like about this book is how rushed it was. And I couldn't help but think the whole time how awesome it would have been if JK were to make the cursed child into a 3 or 4 book series with all of the same magic that came with Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Told as a screen play, the story is written in four acts, two parts. It does lack the intensity of previous works, and the world building is all left to the readers imagination. Hopefully you already know the back story, so the images come in loud and clear.

What I liked the best was the way the story looks into the world of the now and the what if? The book starts 19 years after book 7. Harry and Ginnie have three children, and this story is about boy number 2, Albus. Even though written through dialogue, the reader gets a good feel of the angst that surrounds Albus' life as he is always compared to his amazing father. So here we have the present.

Albus is best friends with Draco's son, Scorpius. They are both in Slytherin and spend all their time together. As their years as Hogwart's pass, and they do, real quick, Albus becomes more and more disassociated with his father. When a time-turner is found, Albus thinks this is his moment to outshine his dad. Together, Albus and Scorpius set out to save Cedric Diggery.

So, now we come to the what ifs? The first world we glimpse is one where Hermione and Ron never married.That idea alone is enough to stir up loyal fans. The wrongness comes through in the relationships as Ron has no humor and Herminone is a mean, Defense Against the Dark arts teacher. Then it gets worse. Another fiddle with time brings the reader to a time where Harry died and Voldemort rules,  plus Delores Umbridge runs Hogwarts. Just these two peeks into alternate worlds is fabulous.

Then things get worse and wham, the author's throw in a twist and betrayal that I didn't suspect. Nicely done. I think Harry Potter fans will enjoy this look into Harry's life. The fact that it is written as a screenplay is odd, but okay. I give it 4.5 stars!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I bought this book seven hours after it was released, and I read it twice in my room before I came down for breakfast. I was so intent on reading it that I just rushed through it and loved it. But after I went back and read it again and again, I had to notice some differences and things that I didn't like about it.

Although this is a great book and the script line makes it seem really interesting and good, I was definitely not reading the same type of story as Harry Potter, and it is clear that this was not completely written by J.K. Rowling. It was really good, but in a very different style and I noticed several times that it would give information that was completely wrong from the Harry Potter series or things that they just made up. The characters acted in different manners and sometimes things happened that just didn't make sense. Also, I loved the time travel, but we have a whole other book about time travel in the third movie, but it tied in with the plot better. I know that Albus wanted to show to his dad that he is also good and can do things, but I just can't see why he'd risk his life to save the son of someone who had rejected him.
I loved the party with Snape in it, and I loved that they introduced new characters, but the Cedric Diggory turning into a Death Eater because he lost the Tri-wizard Tournament is a bit much, as well as the part with Padma getting married to Ron. Hermione going with Krum made Ron jealous! If he went with Hermione why on Earth would that mean that he is jealous of Padma! She is in Ravenclaw and he probably hasn't spoken mroe than five words to her in all their time at Hogwarts. I am also a little bit disappointed that they left out almost all of the kids besides Scorpius, Albus and Rose form the story. I would have liked to hear more about them. Albus is always talking about how he hates Hogwarts, but we hardly even get a view of what is making him hate it, except for a tiny bit at the beginning. And Voldemort having a child... it just seems like a joke to me, because I just finished the Deathly Hallows for the 50 thousandth time, and she is pregnant NOWHERE unless somehow magic makes a baby disappear and appear out of thin air, but let's be honest folks. Also, how can Delphi fly? It says that she learned it from Voldemort, but he can't fly without a wand. The Death Eaters and Voldemort can turn into those black-ball-spirit-things, but they can't just glide without a wand.

But honestly, if you don't focus on that stuff and you're not looking for something EXACTLY like Harry Potter, then this book would be great for you. The script adds a lot of suspense to the story sometimes in the way that it's written and has a pretty good storyline. I absolutely loved it (apart from the mistakes) and gave it a four star because I don't want to be those rude people who just give it one stars. Yes, no story is perfect, but no story is done without work. It doesn't help anyone to get feedback from people after they've spent a year on a book to be told that it is terrible. I liked the book, and I hope that you did (do) too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

A fantastic read but u must remember this is just a script!!!","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","I'm so not giving away spoilers I hate that. And I'm sorry if my review may not make sense. It's an emotional night. So here it is... This would have made a fantastic book. It really would have. People need to remember this is not a novel but a play. It was fantastic and if you start this book realizing that it is not a novel but a script/play you will get why I gave it only 4 stars. This is the bones of a novel, the heart. What's missing are the things that make Harry Potter books phenomenal. The tiny and huge things we love. Those descriptions of things that make our imagination run wild! But this script has the one ingredient that all of Harry's books have. The actual story.  The core of the book. It really is fantastic to read about the world of the grown ups and to see how they cope through the children they have. To see how different their children are and to see who they become. The story really is only the minimalist part of any Harry Potter books. It has magic but not what's expected. Not what we've been so spoiled by Ms Rowlings.  And how could it. The book is the play that is in production in England. I find myself without the proper words to describe this manifesto maybe because of the nostalgia I felt as I watched my child's excited face as she got the book she waited for so long for. And was brought back to myself pre children waiting for my Harry book and spending the night reading it. The main focus of this book is children and parents. And how the past affects the future. The author nailed it. I so wish I could give it a five star ratings but the thing troubling me is that this totally could have been a novel beloved by everyone because the story was perfect. It needed the extras the wild, magical beings describe like they have been in the past by JK Rowling. So it leaves me totally wondering why it wasn't a novel??? Over all it truly was wonderful. If you are an adult who read the books and has a child who loves the books as well, then this story will effect you and make you emotional. It is a fantastic read, and I hope that the author turns it into a novel.

At best, this sounds too good to be true. At worst, it sounds like a misbegotten cash-grab. Add to that the fact that the story was to be a play, not a novel or a film, and you have one of the most eyebrow-raising announcements in recent memory. So is ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" a worthy addition to the wizarding canon, or a complete dud? I'd have to say it falls somewhere between those two. I'll stick to mild spoilers only as I explain, but if you're determined to be completely surprised, I advise you to go in blind and form your own opinions. The book/play is definitely worth buying.

First, the bad. I don't really understand what's become of J.K. Rowling in recent years. She transformed the literary and cinematic realms with her Potter books, pioneering fantasy trends that continue to this day. I suppose she's trying to make stage plays more popular now? Not sure if that will take off, and it's kind of unfair for the many fans who can't afford to go see the play themselves. Those people are stuck with reading the script, which requires a lot more imagination to really enjoy. There's very little of Rowling's great descriptive prose on display, mostly just dialogue - and it's unclear how much of that was actually written word-for-word by her personally. It sounds like her style; I'll say that. But reading it definitely pales in comparison to reading an actual book. Frankly, I'm disappointed that Rowling hasn't taken the time to flesh this out into a novel. The same goes for the other Potter-related fiction she's written lately - the pre-Fantastic-Beasts pieces on Pottermore, to be precise. It's like reading pitches she hasn't bothered to turn into real books. Obviously, when you're as famous as Rowling, you can get away with posting your world-building notes online or having somebody else turn a story idea into a script and still have millions reading the stuff...but it smacks of laziness on her part, in my opinion.

Also, if you come to this book hoping for a new era of Harry Potter, you're going to be disappointed. This book is an epilogue to the original series, not the start of a new one. There's nothing ground-breaking. The mythology is not expanded, and the new characters spend most of their time dealing with the legacies of the original cast. I'm gratified that the wizarding world will be built up by the Fantastic Beasts film(s), but there's a lot of untapped potential in the modern Potterverse that isn't even touched in ""Cursed Child"".

So, basically what you've got is a skeletal ""tribute"" story that's not quite meaty enough to qualify as an eighth Potter book. What is there left to like, then?

What makes ""Cursed Child"" work despite all the strikes against it is what it does with the aftermath of the original stories. If ""Deathly Hallows"" had to have a follow-up in the first place, then this is a surprisingly good one. It's certainly an improvement on the frequently-criticized, rushed epilogue to ""Hallows"". This is basically an expansion of that last chapter, exploring what it's like for Albus Potter to grow up dealing with his famous dad's legacy. And it's very believable in that respect. True, Albus doesn't come across as likable until near the end of the book, and even Harry shows some striking flaws as a father. But given where both these characters are coming from, these problems make sense. It's not the forced ""happily ever after"" of the Hallows epilogue; it's complex and realistic. Plus, there's a very sympathetic, funny character in play in the form of Scorpius Malfoy, Draco's son. He ends up stealing the show, and is arguably the hero of the story in his own right. His lines made me laugh out loud more than once, and convinced me that to whatever degree Rowling was involved in writing this story, she's clearly still ""got it"".

The story, once you get past the awkward format, is gripping - I devoured it in one afternoon. There are quite a few surprises in store for hardcore fans. And on the whole, the tone is very appropriate for those who have ""grown up"" along with Harry. Fans who are now adults can relate with the themes explored here, even when characters mess up pretty badly. Harry certainly made plenty of his own mistakes over the years, and occasionally acted like a jerk. So I'd argue that it's worth giving Harry's progeny a chance, even if you don't take to him at first. At the very least, read it for Scorpius. I'm not saying you definitely won't be disappointed, but there are far worse ways for a Potter fan to bide the time until Fantastic Beasts gives us a more weighty addition to the Potterverse.

One final point - one or two people have criticized the fact that Albus and Scorpius aren't a couple (they're both portrayed as having female love interests). All I'll say on the subject is that it's refreshing, in an age obsessed with ""representation"", to see a strong friendship between two males depicted without any romantic element. I imagine many readers will find it disgracefully ""heteronormative"", but I liked it very much.

So, overall, I recommend this book. Just don't expect more from it than what it is - an enjoyable farewell to Harry Potter that doesn't disgrace the legacy of the original seven books, even if it does little to advance that legacy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Its been a while since I have read with such childlike voracity...not since the first time I read the original HP books at least. Never have I been so absorbed in my mind, removed from the world, or have experienced physical gasps of surprise and an influx of heartbeats. I'll deliver the ugly first: technically, the play is no masterpiece. It does not compare to the original story, and I am almost certain nothing will. But what I find extraordinarily transforming, striking, and satisfying about Cursed Child is its finality. I didn't realize when I finished the Original 7 that there was so much missing--so many words left aching to be delivered, resolutions to be undone and rewrapped. I felt my breath escape me within the play's pages. Moments and scenes left me achingly pounding and gloriously hungry.

What I love most--Cursed Child reintroduced all of the important characters and shuffled them off them with more care. Within the pages I heard voices of people I believed we would no longer hear from--and took them away just as gently...like catching a fish, tenderly unhooking it's squirming silver body, and laying it in the water again, witnessing its shimmering scales slink away. This time, I think, it was easier to leave the Wizarding World because I knew I had to.

Parts of the story itself felt a little overdone and rushed, but you must keep in mind that this addition is originally intended to be watched, not read, with delivery fitting under a specific window of time. For this I know I did not experience the full breath and absorption of Cursed Child during my read-through, and I am sure live-performance characteristics such as dialectic nuances and set transformations would definitely expand this work even more, but just reading the play itself took me back into this world of magic, mishap, and mischievousness that Potterheads are long-time familiar with. I am curious how the experience of watching it live differs, and cannot wait to see it when I have the chance.

Cheers to Jo and the team..the Wizarding World has gained a new accolade for its trophy case, another hidden passage way through which we may apparate home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling's work, but rather a cooperative effort. The story itself, dealing with Harry's son, Albus, might have been everything I'd hoped it would be, had it not been for the problem that, in my opinion, the writing did not hold true to the standards to which I have come to look forward with Ms. Rowling's work. Differences in writing skills aside, I tried to see beyond the inconsistent style, to the meat of the story.

Dealing with the relationship between father and son, Albus' rebellion against who he felt people expected him to be, as Harry's son, and his discovery that he was more like his father than he thought, does make for an interesting evolution of the HP saga. In this tale, however, Albus just seems more like a pouting, rebellious child who feels put-upon by having a famous father. Unlike Harry, he seems to lack the noble character of his father at first, preferring a pity-party over 'sucking it up and dealing with' his life.

Albus doesn't seem to have the soul-deep, innate sense of honour that defined Harry (not to mention thevery deep type of person he appeared to be in the last scene of Deathly Hallows, both in the book and movie), and yet the reader is supposed to just love the little guy to death, simply because he's Harry's son? The blurb of the book indicates that we are to feel compassion for this child who is finding it hard to fill his father's shoes, but I stopped feeling sorry for him early on, even though there were still times that I sympathized throughout the story.

There was very little in this book that ""fit"" with the HP saga, from the grown up versions of Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione and Draco and his family...oh, yes and speaking of which, what was with the very thinly veiled inference to Scorpius' attraction toward Albus? If you're going to have the character gay, be up front about it...or if he wasn't (he did have a crush on Lily), at least delve a little deeper into what that attraction actually was: admiration? envy? brotherly love (sure didn't seem that way)? or maybe just a preteen questioning where his psyche lies? Better yet, leave it out altogether, because all it did was detract from the side-story of a deep friendship developing between two boys whose fathers were, at one time, enemies.

Now, this sounds like I didn't enjoy the book, but in truth, I found a lot to like about it, even if it wasn't very J.K.-ish.. However, to agree with another reviewer, it just seemed more like fanfic. Had it followed the character of the characters more closely, and played true to what we HP fans already know about the wizarding world after around twenty years or so of visiting, through books and movies, the book could have been exceptional. As it is, it was simply a pretty good read, IF you'd never been introduced to Harry and the gang.

This should have been a GREAT book, but there was no justice done to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Since J.K.Rowling is not here the sole author, there are places where her voice doesn't come through completely, and there are a few disparities with the previous books. This is, after all, a play script. For example, previously the two Weasley twins ran their joke shop. but now their younger brother Ron is shown as the proprietor. Interesting characters from previous books are unmentioned.
  Of course scientific analysis of fantasies is rather pointless - who cares? -  but it occurs to me that all the various creatures described in earlier books could have been created by wizards and witches, and that includes elves, gnomes, trolls, giants, hippogriffs, centaurs... all are derivatives of human beings, designed for either usefulness or just whimsy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was excited about Cursed Child and had high expectations that were not met. Overall the story is good- I thought it was going in one direction and they threw a curveball in which was refreshing. It was also fast paced and a quick read. However, I felt as though some of the character choices didn't make sense and the book was still reliant on Harry.
Logistically, I am fascinated to know how they pull this off on stage as the scene is constantly changing. Some people may not appreciate the script (vs a novel) but I have a theatre background and liked reading it with each characters voice.

Rogers","Nice to extend the Harry Potter line, but nothing like the originals.","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2017","I'll preface this by saying, I'm not a literary genius by any stretch of the imagination.  I enjoy reading, and thoroughly enjoyed the original Harry Potter books.  That being said, I enjoyed this ""book""/playscript for what it was... just an added story to the Harry Potter storyline.  Nothing particularly special, no sense of continued wonder that was built through the original books.  I think that's one of the things I loved about the original books, there a constant sense of ""ooooh, where is this going next?"" and general speculation from book to book.  This was more of a short story, that didn't have that sense of wonder for me.  It told a pretty good story, but it definitely began and ended for me.

It took me a while to write this review.  I think after reading the Deathly Hallows, my imagination came up with an idea of what would happen to Harry and the rest of the gang.  Where they would go, and what they would do.  This book destroyed that, and I think that gave an immediate negative bias toward the story.  I had expectations that weren't met, but that shouldn't weigh in on whether it was a good story or not.  Here I am a year later, and I can say I did enjoy the story.  If you have similar thoughts about what happened to Harry and the gang after the Deathly Hallows, let it go before reading this.... read it as objectively as possible, and let it sit for a while before you really judge it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I enjoyed it thoroughly. Maybe because I had low expectations for it? I think if you are reading this expecting it to be as good as or exactly like any of the original 7 books, you will be disappointed.  But it was enjoyable, and a great way to revisit the world of Harry Potter that I love and miss. It definitely has limitations being written as a script, and it isn't on par with the novels by any means, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have value of it's own. Is it the kind of fleshed out 8th book that JK Rowling would have written if she were to written a full novel on her own, of course not. But it was fun to read, fun to get a bit of Harry Potter back and I devoured it in one sitting basically. Glad I read it , despite the negative criticism surrounding it. I especially have to laugh a bit at everyone whining about Harry's ""moral integrity"" and that this character would NEVER do this or that.... which come on, is ridiculous...  did we all forget what a whiney, surly, self absorbed JERK Harry was for book number 5? yeah. he doesn't always take the high road. I guess I read this more as a story about the kids than a deep dive into the psyche of Harry, Ron and Hermoine... there are parts that I rolled my eyes at, but for an entertaining few hours, which is basically what I am looking for in a book, it was perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_162?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=162&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, I think it safe to say that the major interpersonal conflict in the play's plot could have been established much more quickly; the beginning I found tedious and repetitive. Once this was out of the way, however, the pace moves along quite nicely. There are flashbacks to the books/films which are brief enough not to slog things down, but that, as a fan, I found delightful. A major event in one of the books/films is a primary vehicle for plot advancement here; this is done quite well, when it could have easily been a retreading disaster.

That being said, of the two main characters, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, the former, though the main figure, is wooden and, frankly, not that interesting. Scorpius is the real scene-stealer; he's quirky, extremely likable, and much more real than his counterpart. He truly made the play for me.

Like the books themselves, much is predictable here. One can see immediately who the truly menacing character will turn out to be; the ""true meaning"" of the curse over the child is patently obvious (to everyone but those on stage). And when, oh when, will Ron Weasley's character be allowed to be anything more than comic relief? Still, if you love the series, this book will grab you at least by Act Two, and provide you a fun, engaging, and entirely worthwhile experience. At first, I felt prepared for disappointment. By its finish, I was psyched for the inevitable film -- and the next installment!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_164?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=164&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I do wonder if Rowling had more to do with the story if Harry would of ended up with the job he got as reading the original books I always pictured him becoming Hogswarts dark arts teacher.  I found that the children  James, Al and Rose charming  and family structure only hinted at in the epilogue of the deadly hollows book/movie expanded on to be great to read about.  I really like  Harry and the lot including Draco Malfoy as adults replacing their childhood problems with new ones as they try to deal with things differently that the old Ministry of magic had.  i do give it 4 stars because I did really like it but unlike the other Potter books that I read in a day I did not love this one and found myself able to set it down.  like films such as Back to the Future or season 5 final of My little pony the more Al and Scorpius time travel the worst  things change for the present.

The two become unlikely friends facing not only the usual causes of teen angst, but also the shadows of their famous (or infamous) parents. When they learn that Cedric Diggory's father still blames Harry for the death of his son, the two hatch a plot to ""set things right"", only to learn the hard way the dangers of trying to rewrite history.

A lot of people I know said it was garbage and that it was frustrating to have 7 books as Harry grew up but not for his son. I get that, but it’s not the same thing. I thought the book was good, there were some things that bugged me I suppose (referring to Hagrid’s cake as saying “Happy Birthday Harry” was the first). I concluded it would’ve been better if J.K. Rowling had written it alone. You get used to the play format - it’s very easy to read. It was nice to have a reunion with everyone.

As a play it can't go into much depth, so it's more like HP lite.

Despite the story wrapping up almost too neatly, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I just loved being back in that world again!

For parents, I think this book is more geared toward a slightly older audience - at least one who understands the birds and the bees! I don't think it is any darker than any of the other HP books, but (I don't think this is a spoiler but just in case stop here)

I know others have complained about the play format, but I knew when I ordered it that it was a script, not a novel. If you are a big Harry Potter fan, I recommend at least giving it a shot. I think you'll enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First of all, it isn't really by J. K. Rowling and it isn't (much) about Harry Potter. It's about his bullied and alienated son Albus Severus. The only surprise is how beastly Harry and his wizard demographic turned out; prepare to be disillusioned. There is much time traveling, Back to the Future style (trying to fix bad stuff in the past). This gets annoying after a while. The final father-son confrontation is predictable but satisfying. The dialogue is well-written.

I laughed, I cried, and I was very very confused. This script took about 2 1/2 hours to read, and I didn't enjoy every second of it, but it was fun to read. Some things were weird and it didn't really have the same ""Harry Potter"" vibe as the other books. But, of course, this is play and is meant to be performed, and the visual is a crucial part to the story. I'm sure that just the script doesn't do the play justice.

I waited at a bookstore until midnight to get it.

I must admit, I quite liked it. I am a tried-and-true Potterhead, and even though it wasn't written by JKR herself, the book did stay somewhat true to the characters, etc. To me, it did feel like a couple books crammed into one. There could have been so much more character development and scene development going on. BUT, you have to remember that THIS IS A SCRIPT FOR THE PLAY, and not an ACTUAL BOOK. I could tell that JKR's writing style was somewhat used, and the story was actually really interesting.

There were some things that I didn't quite understand that could have been explained a little more: see below (spoilers).

WARNING: SPOILER ALERT

1) Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange had a daughter who was born before the Battle of Hogwarts. How did no one know about her??? She made an appearance in the 8th book, and nobody knew who she was to begin with!
2) The whole thing where Harry and Albus don't get along well. That's not cool.
3) Severus Snape makes an appearance. He is not true to his character in the book series, and it kind of made me a little upset that he wasn't all snotty, sarcastic, etc.
4) Dolores Umbridge runs basically a cult at Hogwarts where they pretty much worship Voldemort. It's not cool, and kind of degrades the image of Scorpio (Draco's son...who the students call the ""Scorpion King"" when Albus and he go back in time).
5) The Time-Turners I actually liked. What I didn't like was how someone ""made"" a TT out of metal. It wasn't very believable.

So, all in all, I did like the book. It's hard to consider it the ""8th Harry Potter book"" because it just isn't JKR's writing style. It was very good and entertaining, but it did feel slightly rushed. I do recommend buying it to read it because it was interesting and you learn a lot about some of the characters that you didn't know before.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I got this book from Amazon a few days after it came out and read the whole thing in one day. I would have rated this book five stars, but I only rated it four for a few reasons-
* The book is written in script format, since it was based off a play, which is kind of annoying, but once you get used to it it's just as good as reading a normal book.
* Some bits of the story, like the Trolley Witch, seem a bit ridiculous (but isn't the whole Harry Potter series that way?)
* Rose Granger-Weasley and James Sirius Potter are barely in it, and Teddy Lupin isn't in it AT ALL.

But overall it's great <3 It's really cool to read about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco (unfortunately, Neville and Luna aren't in it) in the future and it was also really cool to learn more about their kids (especially Scorpius)

I would totally recommend buying this book if you're a Harry Potter fan!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was against pre-ordering since this is just a printed script but I bought it today anyway. If your hoping for a full fledged novel this might not be for you but it does have a interesting story.

This story takes place years and years after the events of the original series. The characters from the original books all have children who don't always seem to follow in their parents footsteps. Albus Potter and his father's relationship is strained and becomes even more so strained throughout the script.

Scorpius Malfoy is a charming character and by far my favorite in this story. Albus and Scorpius becomes friends and go on a journey to try to save someone from the past. This doesn't go according to plan.

I've read some reviews that say this story is very fanfiction like and though I can see where these are coming from...there is still some magic in this story. This is coming from a 90's kid who read the books when they first came out.

But in my opinion, it doesn't come anywhere close to seeing it live. There's so much magic & theatricality on stage, and simply reading the dialogue with limited stage directions doesn't make any of that come to life.

Cooper","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - whens the movie going to be produced?","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2016","This is a play script, not a book. But still it reads like it fits right in with the other Harry Potter novels. Basically, the story starts off right where the postscript of the movie Death Hallow part 2 left off, with Harry, Ginny and sons at Platform 9 3/4 as Albus Severus Potter prepares to leave for his first year at Hogwarts and is worrying about being sorted into Slytherin.

I will try to avoid spoilers, but let's just say Albus makes best friends with Scorpius Malfoy, who seems to have fallen far from his father's and grandfather's tree.

There's a timeturner involved, a prophecy, and the return of Voldemort.

That should be enough to get you hooked.  For me, I am waiting for the play to come to the USA and then I have to figure out how to secure some of the tickets which will may be sold out for decades in advance.

And if you figure it out, tell me who the cursed child is supposed to be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

And, even though the book have a very interesting story, it's not Harry Potter style at all. It was not written by J.K Rowling and yes, it is a play's script, which means it's a very straightforward narrative. The lack of details and descriptions made me not fall in love with this book. It coud be an amazing story if written by J.K. Rowling, but as it is, it's not.

I did however, brace myself prior to reading this book. I was aware that J.K. Rowling was most likely only minimally involved and that it wasn't going to read the same since it was a screen play. I think that knowledge and preparation made it easier for me to enjoy this book. The biggest issue with it? That was probably the fact that it tried to do so much with so little. Plays have to be short enough to sit through, yet this one spanned great amounts of time and jumped around. It therefore lacked the detail necessary at times to make plot twists believable. I found myself sitting there wondering 'how?' and 'why' way too many times. I think that was the hardest part for most Potter fans and why so many say it reads like a fanfic. It simply doesn't take the time to develop and explain things and simply relies on people taking everything in stride. That being said, I felt there were some truly 'Harry Potter' moments. I got a little teary eyed and nostalgic at times, and that is really why I enjoyed it. I would not recommend comparing this to the books. There is no contest. It has no where near the talent in it that they did. That being said, it certainly has a place in the Harry Potter world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The beginning was a bit slow as they set up the characters of Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. The second half bumped up my opinion of the book considerably once we got into the meat of the plot. It just took awhile to get there. Basically, Albus Severus is trying to go back in time to right a wrong of his father's but ends up messing up the fabric of time. I really enjoyed seeing how small changes altered the current reality so much. The friendship between the two boys was really great and reminded me of the trio in its strength and resolve. Some of the older generation felt a bit out of character at the beginning but I feel like the characters kind of found themselves again but the end of the book.

This isn't really just another Harry Potter book so don't expect it to be like the other ones. Go in with an open mind to a slightly different writing style, an entirely different format, and new characters. It is a good read but some die hard Harry Potter fans might be a bit let down if they were really looking for a direct continuation of the seven books JK Rowling wrote about Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Is this the best Harry Potter book from the series? No. But it is a nice addition to the world of Harry Potter characters and to me it reads quite nicely. Though because it is written as a play script, you have to read it back as such. Going into this book knowing that it will and should read differently is the key. The story itself I think is above average with enough plot twists to keep the readers (at least me) interested and flipping through the pages. You can't be mad at JK for licensing out the story because we've all wanted another one so badly and she wouldn't write more.

Rowling's return to the Wizarding World in ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One & Two"" picks up with the epilogue from ""Deathly Hallows"", where Harry and Ginny's youngest son, Albus Severus Potter, prepares to leave for Hogwarts. There, he makes friends with Draco Malfoy's son, Scorpius, as the two bond over being outcasts who inherited legacies from their parents. Without delving into spoilers, the story primarily focuses on family relationships and the idea of sins of the father passing on to the subsequent generation. Harry, despite having a rich surrogate family, struggles to be a good father. In fact, all of the main characters who grew up during the original novels struggle in adulthood, likely a result of childhoods that were filled with danger and war. Despite this, they still care about their own children and want to shelter them from growing up with the struggles they endured, though they often go about this as blunderingly as Dumbledore in ""Order of the Phoenix"".
There are several nice callbacks to the original novels, with cameos and even significant roles from old favorites. Professor McGonagall gets to chastise Harry and friends as adults, saying to Albus, ""The lesson even your father sometimes failed to heed is that bravery doesn't forgive stupidity"" (p. 201). Rowling also knows when to let the full weight of a scene play out and several scenes return to the most poignant and tear-inducing moments in Rowling's original seven novels. Finally, the title itself is something of a riddle, leaving it up to the audience to determine just who is the ""cursed child"" as there are many candidates. ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" continues the rich world Rowling introduced in 1997 and will leave the audience begging for more stories of Albus Severus and Scorpius.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_194?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=194&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I definitely enjoyed reading it, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. I loved reading Rowling's style and delving into the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends, but it just didn't flow as easily as the other books in the series did. The characters also seemed a bit off and a little one-dimensional compared to the rest of the series. Perhaps it's because we only had one volume to get to know the characters as opposed to the seven in the original series? Perhaps it was the format of a script rather than the traditional novel? Perhaps there was too much hype about the fact that there was another book in the series? I'm not sure. I'm glad that Rowling wrote this script though, it was nice to have some new Harry Potter back into my life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Some readers will love it, some will hate it.  Some (or most) will probably fall approximately into the middle.  Personally I take it for what it is – the script for a play which has huge entertainment value, a surprisingly strongly emotional ending, as well as a plethora of plot twists and turns along the way.  It is certainly well structured, avoiding the tediousity (is that a word?) of unnecessary lessons and introductions and steep learning curves and exams that we all have fond memories of, and instead, focusing on the relationship (or in some cases, the lack thereof) which make up life in the world of witches and wizards.

Oh, and there’s an adventure to be had, too, and its a doosie.  As i mentioned above, once the story gets going, the plot twists and turns more frequently than the mighty Amazon River.  Naturally it is not as deep or as moving as the full length novels which created this extraordinary and world changing legend.  The star of the show is undoubtedly SCORPIUS, the lone son of Draco Malfoy.  And what a sad story *that* is.  He (SPOILERS) befriends Albus Potter (son of Harry and Ginny) in chapter one and the reader doesn't look back.  Some of the lines he comes out with will make all readers, especially adults, burst out laughing over and over again.  Once you get used to the writing and publishing style of the book, it becomes a joy to read.  There is no great depth here, so adjust your mind set from the great times and adventures of books 1 through 7 before commencing.  New characters are a bonus, especially one in particular (SPOILERS) whom the reader will meet and be suitably impressed with on the Hogwarts Express.

Having said that, it *is* hard at times, thinking of the world saving trio of Ron, Harry and Hermione as grown up adults, each with adult and muggle based responsibilities of their own to manage and deal with.  What is not difficult to accept is the rambunctious goings-on of the two main characters studying magic (as a part time hobby) but also managing to saving the world, and coincidentally preventing the dreaded the return of You Know Who in the process.  Scorpius is a gorgeous character, full of life and live, and wisdom, and enthusiasm to make things right, even if he hates the Greatest Wizard The World Has ever Known Who Happens to Be His Father.

The utlimate solution to the puzzle of preventing the return of You Know Who is brilliant.  In typical JK fashion, hints are scattered throughout the book for the eagle eyed observer to pick up and analyse.  I am thefirst to confess I did not see it all coming, but i much prefer to  sit back and enjoy the show instead of wasting precious amounts of mental concentration trying to predict what is about to happen.

So the book is finished.  I loved it.  As i have said above, it is not as long, deep or complex as the classics from the past but its a great way for veterans to extend the most unique fantasy universe ever created.  If nothing else, once read, it gives the reader strong encouragement to revisit the wonder, excitement, pure innocence and absolute genius of the original books sooner than you normally would have.  And that can’t be a bad thing, can it?

Four stars for this fantastic but slighty short read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The dialog is a bit corny, as plays tend to be. They don't have the luxury of movie closeups and have to be oddly descriptive in dialog.

It's a good story and I imagined it on a stage as I read it, which is the main reason I think I enjoyed it so much. It added a new layer to the life of Harry Potter and gave excellent context for the lives of the characters after the last book.

Part 2 was far more exciting than part 1, but both were very enjoyable.

There are 2 reasons why I knocked it down a star...

1. There's a contradiction with the last book on Harry's scar.
2. Ron's character feels... Off... From how he was portrayed in the books.

Aside from those 2 things, I highly recommend this to any Potter fan but I urge you all to remember that this is a play, not a full book, and to keep that in mind as you go through it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Then I saw the ratio of 5 stars to 1 star reviews.  I was nervous.  I decided to go into this book understanding that this was not part of the original seven books.  It has Ms. Rowling's name on it but it is not solely her project.  I am glad I took this stance before cracking it open.  I enjoyed it while I was reading and am happy to add it (as a companion piece) to the rest of the collection.  The more I think and talk about the book, though, the more excited I get.  I mean, it's Harry Potter!

I do understand why some have said that there is little to know character development.  Things move quickly - almost whiplash-inducing quickly - but, again, this is a play; a script and (much like a movie) three hours cannot be spent on character evolution.  As an admirer of the original series, I missed ""growing up"" with Albus like we did with Harry but I was also thankful that, as the reader, I was spared the nitty-gritty details and was placed directly into the story.  Besides, it picked up precisely where Deathly Hallows left off.

I laughed more than I expected and there was definitely a few instances where I sighed and placed my hand over my heart at the mention of certain characters.  I would like to see the performance.

The first book came out when I was 13, and the first film at 17, so I spent much of my teens and young adult years completely immersed in JK Rowling's world.

Seeing as this totally influences my objectivity of writing a proper review, my personal opinions of ""The Cursed Child"" should be taken with a grain of salt.

I personally loved this addition to the wizarding world that JKR created. It was lovely to be able to see the characters I grew up with as adults and get to know their children. Part of what I loved about this play is that despite the grand instances of fantasy, there were very relatable themes present throughout the script. Preteens/Teenagers struggling with who they are and their place in the world, parents facing challenges in connecting with their children and worrying about screwing them up...people trying to do their best to live a solid, good and productive life.

I have read the endless complaints surrounding the script, from the text not being reflective of the world JKR gave us to dramatic plot points being a bit overkill considering the context. Was it a bit heavyhanded on plot? Yes. Did it provide us with numerous instances where our characters behaved completely out of character? Absolutely.

But at the heart of the script, found within even its more hair pulling plot points, I saw the soul of what lead so many of us to fall in love with Harry Potter in the first place. In my opinion, the play remained loyal to what the original series was able to achieve, and that is why I consider myself a fan of the new play.

Scripts shouldn't be seen as the full picture. Reading dialogue and character actions in script format pales in comparison to seeing the play acted out. It's a completely different art form, and what talented actors are able to do with script material when put to action goes above and beyond what is being depicted in just the written script. Those of us only able to read the play aren't able to see the art form as its intended, which must be considered when properly reviewing the play.

So I loved it. I read the entire thing from start to finish in a matter of hours, and found myself laughing out loud and shedding more than a few tears throughout the experience.

From one Potterhead to another, I wholeheartedly recommend ""The Cursed Child""...provided everyone remember that reading a play's script and actually seeing it performed are two entirely different things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_164?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=164&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I had high hopes for this book but had also read many negative reviews. Having read it today I can tell you it is the worth reading. For me personally this story confirmed many theories I had about the plot and characters and also surprised me with many unexpected plot points. This is also a book of contradictions. While some characters are barely involved and remain very two dimensional, others are explored vividly and very well fleshed out. For me the biggest disappointment in the story was the main conflict which at times was redundant, predictable and a bit ridiculous. However, the relationship explored between Harry and his son Albus is what makes the book worth reading in my opinion, and is well explained. For many Harry Potter fans who have their own ideas of what happened after Dealthy Hallows you may be disappointed. However, if you read with an open mind I think for most this will be a great read and addition to the Harry Potter world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As with the rest of the reviewers, I too am a huge Harry Potter fan. I've read the books and the entire lot of content. After reading the reviews, I didn't even want to read the play. I put it off for some time. But finally, I decided to sit down and read it.

So, a few things:

Most of the characterization is fine. Albus says things a misunderstood teenager would say. Harry says things an overworked adult with a teenage son would say. In my opinion, nothing about their interactions seems unbelievable. Thinking Harry would not say certain things says to me that the reader has no children or doesn't understand how difficult being a parent can be. Those two aside, the other characterizations seem fine too, even Ron getting drunk at his wedding.

Over all, I thought the play was fine! My biggest issue was the general plot---the whole idea of the ""cursed child"" (I won't say more as not to spoil) seems unrealistic (humorous for a fictional series about wizardry). I don't see that storyline fitting in with the original series. That was my biggest problem with the play.

That aside, I found the characterization believable. Give the play a chance. Will I consider it cannon? Probably not, but certainly still worth a read for any Harry Potter fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling didn't actually write this--she was working on fantastic beasts at the time and was kind of just an advisor for this project. And 2-this is really meant to be seen on stage.
The story itself is not that believable to me; having read the original books, there's a lot that doesn't add up. If you read this with the mindset of enjoying it like non-canon fan fiction I think it's more enjoyable.
When seen live, I've heard the effects they use for magic are astounding and I think that is probably the main selling point of the actual play. In terms of reading this I think the best part is Scorpius Malfoy. Everything he says and does is great--which probably has a lot to do with the fact that we knew pretty much nothing about him from the original other than his name.
All in all, for a die hard fan it's worth a read, and for someone who is only a casual fan or has only seen the movies, this might get confusing because there are some characters and events mentioned that weren't in the films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_90?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=90&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

 As for all the bad comments about the plot, no, it wasn't the best story in the world. It definitely doesn't live up to the magic of Rowling's seven book series, but you know what, I don't care. It was so much fun to be able to escape into this world again for the telling of a new story. This world was my childhood and teenage years, and now, as a man of nearly 30, I'm still proud to be a Potterhead, and I'm so thankful that we got this glimpse into what the future holds for those witches and wizards we love so much.

I can't wait for the definitive edition to come out, when I will a physical copy on my shelf right next to Deathly Hallows. I love Harry Potter, and I ALWAYS will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As a play, it would be awesome. If you're looking for a new Harry Potter novel, this is garbage. Keep in mind that this was always intended to be a play & it's fine. The Cursed Child tells an interesting and fairly subtle story about tolerance and acceptance and dealing with expectations...complex philosophical machinations that show sure signs of Rowling's involvement, but this is a script & therefore almost exclusively dialogue without all the internal trepidation & rumination that colors a novel. This is peppered with cameos from many of the beloved Harry Potter characters which is great for the nostalgia factor, but not so peppered with the side-plots and quirky creatures/plants/spells/red herrings that Rowling was able to populate the novels with. If you can take it for what it is, this is a good addition to the larger world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Vizcarra","Fun story, less fun format.","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2017","When I heard there was a new original Harry Potter play in London, I was pretty excited. These things generally make their way to my coast. Unfortunately, it appeared I would have to wait a long while, with no touring show planned for the future. To mollify the US crowd, the powers that be put the script into book-ish form and released it into the wild.

I picked up my copy and sat on it for a while before I got around to reading it. When I finally picked it up to read, I was a little worried I might have lost interest in it; I was fairly meh about the recent Magical Beasts film, and thought I had grown out of Harry Potter’s world.

I did find myself a little confused at the beginning of the book; there’s some odd time-movement and jumping around, and a rush to establish the characters and their basic motivations, but it rather quickly fell into a fun pace that had me reading with rapt attention. The book is told in 4 acts, and it was a superfast read, getting through one act each in four sittings.

The familiar characters are there, along with a bunch of new ones. This is clearly the next generation of Harry Potter, and absolute proof that there are some fun stories to tell - if Rowling feels like telling them. This particular story was rather attached to the previous Harry Potter books, meaning it would be pretty confusing to someone who had not read the previous 7-book series. And the chief concept of the story is recycled from Prisoner of Azkaban, but the overall story doesn’t feel derivative. It feels more like it’s inspired by the established world from the previous books.

All in all, it’s a fun, fast read and leaves you begging for more. My main issue is with the structure of this play-turned-book, which reads like a script, but is distracting in how much of the hand-wavy magic it leaves to stage direction to figure out. I had a hard time believing this would be a good play to watch. That’s more of an issue with the interpretation of the play into book form, but I still found it distracting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

They are meant to be performed. So I switched to listening to it instead on audiobook. That was a much better choice and I scarcely realized it was a play after a short while. So that is the way to solve that problem if you too do not like reading plays. They are very unlike novels.

As to the book itself. I realize as other reviewers have pointed out here that there are some inconsistencies with this book and the epilogue of Book 7 of Harry Potter. However, I'm willing to give some artistic license as the changes aren't that great. The biggest change is that Albus Potter has been brought up in the shadow of his father, Harry, in this work whereas Harry was quite clear at the end of Book 7 that he was going to become as little known as possible.

In this book he and Albus have a significant problem primarily caused by Harry's gigantic reputation. Harry also works within the Ministry of Magic with Hermione and that was also not his stated direction.

So, he changed his mind. That's  all you have to tell yourself to get into this 8th version of the story.

Is it as good as 1-7? It would be just about impossible for it to be so because we are revisiting the main characters as adult parents with children away at Hogwarts. The adventurers become Harry's and Draco's sons who become best friends. They try to bring Cedric back to life by using a time traveling device. They feel sorry for Cedric's father who has never recovered from his death in the earlier books.

That is the gist of it. The audio narrator was quite good and Rowling, as usual, knows how to keep a story rolling along. I just enjoyed having them back but never expected it to be the same as it was. What else is the same as it was? Nothing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I will not follow that line with this new volume but it is constantly present, especially with the two boys Albus and Scorpius who are always running after a third one like Cedric twice and then Delphi both the predator and the prey of the two boys trying to deal with another triad, herself, her father Voldemort and his arch enemy Harry Potter and to move away from the ill-fated triad James Potter Sr., Lily Potter and Harry Potter. It could only lead to a catastrophe since then Voldemort would be building a quartet with the three Potters.

First of all it is a strange book indeed since it is a play and not a novel. So we get no descriptions, or hardly any since stage directions are not as good as prose. It is essentially a dialogue between or among two characters or more, cut up in rather short scenes. You have to rebuild everything in your mind’s eye, if you have a mind and if you have an eye in that mind and thirdly if you can, because it is hard to know the precise intonations intended in these dialogues and at times the meaning depends on these intonations. In other words you, Harry Potter addicts, are going to be frustrated and maladjusted in this dry scenario.

The second remark I will make is that what we read implies a tremendous level of special effects. That is easy in a film or TV series but on a stage…? So you will never get the real thing if you can’t see it on stage and if they do not propose a capture of the play on DVD, a real capture with no re-mastered special effects. Some of them are not very creative. Shape-shifting and shape shifters have become very banal and common place after “Supernatural” (How many season already?), “The X Files” (quite a few seasons too, and they stopped though they are speaking of starting again and they may even have) and “Fringe” (and they have come to an end or the end) or some copy cats of these. And that is of course in the line of vampires who could turn into bats or werewolves who could turn into wolves precisely.

The third element is that this play is un-understandable if you do not know the whole saga. First there are many allusions to event of the previous volumes, the old volumes, and you have an obligation to remember, a duty of memory. But what’s more, the author uses a time-turner to make us go back to old events that are revived that way.  You better know what she is speaking of and in some scenes, the very same way as in Back to the Future you may have two, or why not three though the author avoids that potential possibility, different identities and ages of the same characters. And what’s more  modern identities are crossed with and by contradictory feelings towards the other characters, feelings coming from the past, like how the Potter side reacts to that poor Draco Malfoy. You better review and revise your summaries.

The next remark has to do with some political science fiction resulting from travelling in time and changing history, the famous butterfly effect. We are thus able to visit what the modern world would be if the dark forces were to win, if Voldemort were able to win, like Trump, le Pen or Brexit. If they do, the only solution is to push them around, filibuster them if we can and neutralize them if possible. Can you control a tempest coming from all the frustrations of people in front of the establishment: frustrated in their minds by gross lies and promises that were not held; frustrated in their feelings by the insecurity they feel in front of the changing world they do not understand; and frustrated in their deeper impulses and desires by a world in which genders are multiplied from two to more than a dozen and in which gender orientation is a multiple choice challenge with more than one answer to every stage: the gay feel besieged and become aggressive; the straight feel menaced and become uncertain; and all other colors and options feel queer, bizarre, strange and kind of disoriented.  And Pride is by far not enough to make the world change smoothly.

But political science fiction comes basically, I think, from deranged and corrugated minds: Albus and Scorpius are out of their minds when they want to change the past.  No one can remake history, not even by remembering it which is anyway a reconstruction to make it palatable, digestible and if possible haunting. But it is funny to find out the best intentions in the mental world of two teenagers may lead to the worst nightmares in the life of everybody, the same way as Brexit leads to a chasm of chaos to the point of pushing it back two years and then now three years and in a month or two to four years and after some rounds of negotiations it will be recognized as the perfectly good bad idea. Imagine Voldemort and his Death Eaters and all his dung beetles ready to do the worst crimes for a pellet of cow pie.

The fifth element is that the story is funny and very sentimental if not sentimentalese. That will be the last remark of that type I will make. And this remark leads to the main content of the book as I see it.

The central question is the conflict between the deficient father Harry Potter and his second son? The author does not insist or harp on the first son, a certain James Potter Jr., and thus does not really capture the problem of the younger son. Being a younger son is a real – I mean R.E.A.L., real – curse in itself. Think of Abel when God decided not to favor the first born Cain. At the end there is an allusion to that James Jr. seen as at peace with the father of the two sons, Harry Potter, by Albus Potter, and Harry Potter’s response is then that in fact there is no real relation between him and his elder son. But at the end, that’s too late and it requires a lot more exploration.

But the author, with her two male sidekicks, is a woman, probably a mother and she probably believes she knows what it is to be a parent, forgetting that being a mother has little to do with being a father and she has no direct experience of this father status and men generally cannot really speak of it because they are like afraid of being misunderstood when they start telling you they love their sons, they want to hug them and cuddle them as long as they can and they have to break that desired relation, both mental and physical, by far too early for them, but most of the time too late for the son: in other words they do not know how to shift from the relation of a loving father who expresses his love with physical and mental closeness to the relation of a loving father who expresses his love with concern, support, encouragement to get out in the world and sow their wild mental and physical oats in all social fields. And sure enough Albus Potter and Harry Potter are both incompetent and how they come to some kind of understanding is superficial and purely verbose.

She misses many things and particularly that whether there is a conflict or not, the son will end up either doing some of the things the father did, or not doing some of the things the father did, or doing some of the things the father did not do, or not doing some of the things the father did not do. And most of the time some of each of the four options. That is called transference, positive or negative transference of positive or negative elements. It works both ways from the father who tries to transfer things onto the son, and from the son who tries to be free to choose what he accepts and what he refuses.

The author even goes further and brings together two sons of two fathers, the two sons living a conflict with their respective fathers and the two fathers inheriting an old conflict between them they try to project (transference again) onto their respective sons. She very wisely makes the two boys best friends at first sight. She systematically calls that friendship and calls them friends, but they are best friends and that is love, but I guess in her mind love has to do with desire and impulse and signifies sex, marriage and children. That’s how she deals with Ron and Hermione for example. The girl is a potential mother with all it means. For Albus and Scorpius there cannot be any kind of turning the other into a mother. More about that in a moment. To end up on the transference from Harry to Albus it is simple. Harry declares his fright in front of pigeons, and Albus declares at once they are innocent – go tell that to the guardians of the cathedral in Wells who have invested on falcons to purge the site of its pigeons, or to the managers of airports who also use falcons to clear up the zone of the airport of its pigeons – and as a negative transference he will be a pigeon race manager. That kind of final solution of the conflict is rather trite, and Scorpius does not deserve the same treatment since we do not know his ending, showing that the relation between the two boys is insignificant for the author and she tries to cast it into a block of heterosexual concrete.

We have to understand their dialogue in 2016 when the relations between males, two males or several males, or actually between females too, two females or more, are just the crucial social question of the moment after for example the decision of the US Supreme Court on the subject. I will only take some examples from the end of the book, but it is present all along.

Page 265 Scorpius says: “So we hide in a hole?” Albus answers: “As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years . . .” Then Scorpius retorts: “If I had to choose a companion to be at the return of eternal darkness with, I’d choose you.” In the situation they are in, either this is serious and then the words have a clear meaning: it is a declaration of love on both sides, or it is humor but due to the situation it is really very dark if not black humor. Let’s say, serious or humorous it is nevertheless homoerotic.

Page 300-301 Scorpius says: “I asked out Rose Granger-Weasley.” Albus responds: “And she said no.” Scorpius retorts: “But I asked her. I planted the acorn. The acorn that will grow into our eventual marriage.” That is erotic indeed and, on the side of a dating failure, it is rather male-dominant, maybe even slightly phallocratic. But later on Albus says: “I honestly thought I’d be the first of us to get a girlfriend.” And Scorpius responds: “Oh, you will, undoubtedly, probably that new smoky-eyed Potions professor – she’s old enough for you, right?” Albus reacts: “I don’t have a thing about older women!” And Scorpius can add: “And you’ve got time – a lot of time – to seduce her. Because Rose is going to take years to persuade.” Albus can have the last word: “I admire your confidence.” In this passage they set their orientation as being heterosexual, though Scorpius is rejected – but is he really – by his first “date” who says no of course, and Albus does not seem to be in a rush to get one. In other the two boys have closet undetermined sexual orientation and follow in public some kind of heterosexual game that does not seem to be urgent or really serious. The author is exploiting neither side of the coin that has to do with gender orientation.

I can assure you at 14 they are obsessed by it. And they are indeed.

Page 302 we have this little scene:

“Scorpius reaches in and hugs Albus.
Albus: What’s this? I thought we decided we don’t hug.
Scorpius: I wasn’t sure. Whether we should. In this new version of us – I had in my head.”

It is obvious the heterosexual version of the two boys is the “new version” of them. Then the old version, or the previous version was rather gay, and now they still hug and the play makes it longer than a casual hug between two brothers or cousins. At least Scorpius wants it and takes the initiative, and Albus does not refuse it and takes part in it, accepts it. Is that going to be an orientation, or a gender? We definitely need to get more on those two pubescent teenagers.

After saying all that let me conclude. This play will both exhilarate AND frustrate you. But that’s too bad. Let’s hope we SOON get a DVD capture of the stage production.

The storyline feels silly and pointless and the ""twist"" is neither shocking nor surprising. It also lacks that certain something in the narrative that J.K. Always brought to the books that leads me to believe that her involvement was less than they let on - and I don't think this is only attributable to the fact hat it's a play and not a novel.

I read that a lot of people didn’t feel like the characters from the original series stayed true to themselves, but I don’t know that I think that’s true—they grew up. They changed. If Harry and Hermione and Ron were the same as they were as teenagers, I’d start to worry a little. They seemed like… parents to me. Not perfect parents, but I haven’t met any of those yet, so I was okay with that. Obviously, since this is a play, we don’t get the roundness of characterization that we’d get in a book, but I expected that as well.

JK Rowling is not a screenwriter nor a playwright! How foolish can some of you be to think this is even a BOOK? It's not! It's the script of a PLAY. Book 8? Don't be ridiculous and be quick to label like you do everything, simple-minded fools. This does happen after Book 7, DECADES after and is not a whole, new, central, important big story from either Books 1-7. The fact is this is her story, she created this story, and cowrote it with Jack Thorne(How much, we don't know) and CONSIDERS it CANON. She is a novelist of great imagination and is continuing Harry Potter not for the same reason - she was driven to write Harry Potter and now, much of her motivation is to entertain the fanbase generated from it. This was a story that she had planned out from the beginning, indeed the last chapter was the FIRST she wrote, LITERALLY(Well at least a first draft). So, continuing from that, she will not be as you expect. What do you expect anyway? Can you put it in words? No? You're looking for general fluffy wonder as you expected from the books. JK Rowling is not a saint, she sends tweets with a LOT of political frustration, tweets back spiteful posts occassionally with profanity, softly retaliating against it, and has more of an original interest in adult novels now - crime, drugs, rape, poverty - things she cares about, and poverty - something she relates to. She never thought of herself as your babysitter sitting you down at storytime, she writes what she will. She is still reasonable, JK Rowling, but perhaps some of you ought to shake your misconceptions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

(Actually, that might make it an easier read than more regular plays.)

The Cursed Child could almost be a short story, or a pair of linked short stories (parts 1 and 2 perhaps). And the quickness of the read allows some inconsistencies to slip by almost unnoticed. Frustrating for purists, I'm sure, but the final effect is definitely intriguing. I would LOVE to watch the play!

Re-reading, rechecking, and reviewing (which can't always be done while watching a play), reveals plot holes and inconsistencies with the original Harry Potter canon of course. That's where the purists will be upset. But it’s certainly fun to imagine Harry as a hapless dad, Ron as… well, read the book… and Scorpius Malfoy as... Scorpius is great! The insights into different worlds and what-ifs in this story are very cool, and there are some wise lessons hidden in the time-travel and childhood complaints, making it an intriguing read for adults, as well as a fun one for kids… Imagine the darkness of book 7 combined with the innocence of book 1, perhaps.

I have tattoos, cats are named after characters, I re-read the series at least 3-4 times a year, and have watched the movies so many times I lost count.  I've been waiting for this SCRIPT for ages.  Major emphasis on script.  I'm not sure why people are bashing it so hard.  Obviously this was written so it could be performed on a stage, it was advertised this way, there was no deception...did people not look into this before reading?  It takes some imagination to make this story really come to life, you have to read it like you're watching people perform it.  The story needs to be fast, a little silly, and come full circle at the end.  THIS IS A PLAY!  It needs to wrapped up quick and keep the audience interested/entertained in the theater and in doing that, yes details were over-looked over and you don't get the full Rowling experience. This is a collaboration and really we're lucky to even have it. Too many people are going into this thinking it's a new novel.  Get that out of your head, or yes, you'll probably be disappointed.

I love seeing old characters.  I love seeing their lives after Voldemort.  I love being back at Hogwarts. I love a new adventure.

I actually enjoyed reading this, it's something new, and it was fun.  It is your typical ""butterfly effect"" story line, but with characters I grew up loving.  I'm happy to read anything J.K. Rowling does with Harry Potter.  I appreciate this SCRIPT and wish I could see it performed live.  My imagination is pretty good, but I'm sure this looks amazing on stage.

Keep an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.

A. Solinas","When spares are spared (slight spoilers)","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","When the Harry Potter series ended, I knew that it wouldn't really be over. Not permanently. For one thing, there was too big and devoted a fanbase. For another, too much money to be made.

And I was right, with the 2016 release of a new movie set in the same universe, and ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" a stage play that also serves as a sequel to the original series. While it lacks the narrative ebbs and flows of the books (three years pass in a few pages), it's a solid enough sequel that expands the story into the next generation -- there's dark overtones, plenty of new characters, and more magical shenanigans.

The story begins where the last book ends, with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger sending their children off to Hogwarts. But Albus Potter quickly finds that he's regarded as a disappointment by everyone there -- not is he pretty bad at magic, but he quickly becomes best friends with young Scorpius Malfoy... and is sorted into Slytherin. As the years go by, both Scorpius and Albus are troubled -- Albus by the weight of his father's legacy, and Scorpius by malicious rumors that he's actually the secret son of Voldemort.

Meanwhile, Harry and Hermione discover that a new, superior type of Time-Turner is being created, and Harry begins having strange dreams that hint that something horrible is coming. After the two boys use a Time-Turner to try to right an old wrong, they find that they've messed up the timeline -- and as they try to fix the mistakes they made, they soon find themselves in the grip of a terrible enemy.

Like most time-travel-centric stories, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" becomes a little brain-twisty at times, but the core of it is essentially about two relationships. One is between the unlikely best friends Scorpius and Albus, two boys who seem like opposites... until you realize that both are burdened by the legacy of a father/rumored father. And the other is about Harry and Albus, a father and son who love each other but can't communicate well, and the clash between Albus' moody loneliness and Harry's overprotectiveness.

Admittedly the concept feels rather like a fanfic at times (especially the big reveal about a certain character's true identity -- no, I'm not going to mention who it is, but it's eye-rollingly fanficcy). However, it's a fairly well-written one, with some quirky dialogue (""I don't remember the last time someone asked my name."" ""What is your name?"" ""I've forgotten"") and new characters who fit fairly well into the narrative. There are also some chilling glimpses of a Hogwarts-that-might-have-been, after twenty years of ruthless rule by Voldemort and his followers.

And of course, fans will see a lot of familiar faces -- not just Harry, Hermione, Ron and Draco, but a number of lesser characters in the past or alternate presents (such as Snape or Umbridge). And it does an excellent job fleshing out some of these characters, such as an older, grief-stricken Draco Malfoy, who ironically has more insight into Albus than Harry does. The scene where he and Harry discuss their families and experiences is one of the best of the play.

Probably its biggest problem is a few conversations that don't add much to the actual story or characters, but aren't well-written enough to be entertaining on their own (Ginny and Harry discussing Albus and his issues, which is quite cliched). It feels like it needed another rewrite or two in places, or a scene or two whittled down.

""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" has a somewhat fanficcy flavor, but is a fairly clever story with some solid dialogue, and two strong character-driven subplots. I doubt I'll be watching it onstage, but the story itself is certainly worth checking out for fans of this universe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter was in my life for so long that it seemed like I was welcoming a dear friend back home.
While reading screenplays is not my favorite thing to do, it had the power of taking me back to that magical world. I did wish it was a book, with more details. Another thing was that I kept imagining Harry and his friends as all still teenagers and I had to keep reminding myself that they were parents.
All in all, I'm glad I wasn't deterred from buying and reading this story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_72?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=72&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

For instance, the fact that it's written as a play takes the immersion of the world out of the story and I find myself being yanked back into reality with each set change. Secondly there is quite a bit of the story that feels rushed, especially in the beginning. For the pros, while I thought it didn't read like a traditional Rowling story, it really conveys the fact that it isn't the Harry Potter of old, but rather the next generation of her storytelling with many familiar characters we love from the original series. I say original series because while this is technically the eighth book, it almost completely stands alone as the beginning of a new story arc. The story was worthwhile and kept me guessing a few times which was fun. There are moments where I got a bit choked up which was also a nice surprise because it says that while this wasn't the book everyone was expecting it to be, it still has the power to make me feel for the characters like all the other HP books before it.

Like many who have posted reviews here, I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan and have longed to see his story continue.  I have always felt that JK Rowling had much more to tell about the magical wizarding world, and was disappointed that there were no more books after ""Deathly Hallows"".  I think a lot of people were put off by this being a screen play.  It does not allow for the story to be fleshed out or for JK Rowling's lyrical telling of Harry's magical story to be heard as we are accustomed to in previous books.  It would have been an extraordinary book and I will always regret not having the chance to read it as such.  But, in the end, it is still a very good story and a very worthy epilogue to a tale that is so very dear to my heart.  If wishes came true, then this screenplay would be fleshed out to become the 8th book on the series, full of the magical writing that only JK Rowling can deliver.  But, I am happy to have had at least a glimpse back into Harry's world, and will remain hopeful that this is not truly the end of the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First, I am a huge Potterhead.  I loved the first seven books in the series and was more than a little eager to jump back into Rowling's magical world.  But part of me hesitated with this book because A) it was written as a screenplay and B) while the plot was Rowling's idea, this screenplay was written by two other authors.  Would they get the feel right?  Would it fit in well with the first seven books?  Part of me wanted to know and part of me wanted to leave my knowledge of HP to the first seven books because they were perfection.

My curiosity won out.  I waited a whole .... day.  Yes, my internal dilemma lasted 24 hours.  I waited until August 1st to order a copy and it arrived the next day in all it's HP glory.  A big reason I bought it was that I didn't want to hear chatter about the book that would give away plot points. I had to read it for myself and what HP collection would be complete without the final book?

What I liked about this book:
- I got to revisit some of the characters that I loved from the first book and see what happened to them after the Battle of Hogwarts
- the time travel aspect was an interesting way to include certain characters
- the authors got Rowling's sense of humour right
- I adored Albus and Scorpius's characters and how they related to each other and their parents
- I surprised myself by adoring Draco and Scorpius more than other characters
- there were some great suspenseful scenes and a good twist
- you get to see a very different side to Harry, various characters and their relationships in a new light and even how a certain character regretted some of their past decisions

What I wasn't fond of in this book:
- there was a lot of jumping around with time travel which made it a little convoluted at times
- My biggest peeve, by far, was that I was not a fan of reading a screen play.  I did not like it.  Not one bit.  It felt awkward and didn't flow well. And I think by using this format the reader misses out on Rowling's immense talent of pulling her readers into her world with her vivid descriptions (that is IF she had written this book herself).  I would have much preferred for her to write a novel and if she wanted to publish the screenplay then do so as a separate publication.  But she apparently doesn't require my two cents before publication. ;)

- Now I'm going to show what a serious HP geek I am and sound a lot like Hermione.  If I'm not mistaken, some of the charms in the book were wrong.
In Part One Albus uses an Expelliarmus charm on another person's wand and the books says that the wand ""is summoned to Albus' hand"".  Um, I believe you meant to use Expelliarmus (disarming) AND the Accio (summoning) charm.  Expelliarmus only disarms or releases whatever the person has in their hands, it doesn't give it to the other person. {I'm such a geek}
Also, in Part Two they talk about whipping up some Polyjuice Potion to use that day.  If I'm correct, Polyjuice potion is a complex and very time consuming potion and when they made it in Books 2 and 4 it took weeks and time was of the essence in this current scene {Waving my Geek Flag high!!}
Overall, this is a good addition to the Potter universe but as I read my rating wavered all over the place.  I admit that it took me awhile to get into this book with my favourite parts clearly being the second half of the book (the first half had a very 3 star feel).  The last half is when the action picks up and wonderful secrets are revealed.  Oooo, right?

I consider this Harry Potter: The Next Generation.  An epilogue to the original seven book series.  While it does have its place in the Potter universe, the form that Rowling chose to reveal her latest work, via screenplay written by other authors, greatly diminished my ability to immerse myself into her world again.  Overall, I enjoyed the ride and I liked seeing how things turned out for my favourite characters.  I recommend it for fellow Potterheads and if the play ever comes to Toronto you know who will be there in all her geeky glory.

Favourite Quotes

Note: The following quotes will mention certain characters that appear in the book.  If you don't want a heads up skip this part of my review.

::: spoiler alert :::

Harry: I need your help.  I need your advice.  Bane says Albus is in danger.  How do I protect my son, Dumbledore?

Dumbledore: You ask me, of all people, how to protect a boy in terrible danger?  We cannot protect the young from harm.  Pain must and will come.

Harry: So I'm supposed to stand and watch?

Dumbeldore: No.  You're supposed to teach him how to meet life.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

Dumbledore: Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world.  Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic.  In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again.  Be honest to those you love, show your pain.  To suffer is as human as to breathe.""

Dumbledore: Those that we love never truly leave us, Harry.  There are things that death cannot touch.  Pain .. and memory ... and love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I loved how time turners were used, and I really liked the alternate universes. However, there were some things I really didn't like that much. I loved everything about it until about halfway through, where I think it should have ended. The plot pulled itself to an end... then, in my opinion, a much worse story began. The only thing I disliked about the first half was how Snape instantly trusted Scorpius, and was able to give up his life so easily. I think it would have been a much better story if Snape and Hermione didn't trust him at first, and eventually when Snape found out he had to die, he wouldn't want to fix it at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Since it's lacking J. K. Rowling's prose and sense of story curve to move the plot along, one needs to bring some degree of character foreknowledge and imagination to the (mostly) brief scenes and stage directions. Or, in the words of Robert Frost:

""It asks a little of us here
It asks of us a certain height.""

No spoilers—but from my point of view, the ""relationship/alienation"" thread running through the play's four acts successfully speaks to its audience (certainly to me!) and effectively binds the work to the authentic HP narrative of Years 1-7.

• Will ""Cursed Child"" become HP canon? I doubt it.
• Did the series necessarily need this addition? Probably not.
• Can I imagine what it would have been like had Rowling written this plot in an actual eighth book—without a doubt!

Having said all that—and not intending to ""damn with faint praise""—I'm still quite glad I read it. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I ordered the print edition about a month prior to launch  and was supposed to be delivered 2 days after offical launch

My wife is a big fan of Harry Porter series so decided to buy kindle copy online at midnight.
well, the clock turned 12 midnight on the east coast and trying to buy it by refreshing the page for kindle edition , It just didn't work for at least 10 minutes before I just gave up and went to apple bookstore and bought it instantly , no issues at all. Si in my experience there was a delay in kindle launch when ibook was available.

My wife was able to finish it before the book in print arrived in 2 days . She feels it was not excellent but still above average . It's written in play  style so dialogues are there rather than the usual flow of the story .

she is excited to watch the play someday

I would prefer to have it in book form for clarity--I am not familiar with reading plays and it seemed to me that some of the descriptions of action were a little confusing.  But, hey, I've gotten at least a few questions answered about the next Potter saga section (THAT THERE IS ONE IS MAJOR!, and second, that it truly carries on in the next generation of Potters (Harry may well appear as a major force in the story later, but he's not much there in the first act.  His youngest son is the main character, and his friendship with a young boy who is not befriended by others in the school.  And  THIS BOY'S LAST NAME IS MALFOY.).

The writing is a little awkward, perhaps is is standard with a play--after all, they are quite frequently changing lines and stuff, especially at the start of a run, so there's no real drive for perfect perfection, as it may change tomorrow!  As long as it is readable and the actors can see what they are supposed to be doing and saying, that's the important thing.  With that in mind, if that is true, then the lax description and explanation are excusable.  As a book, it would not be, particularly from such a beloved series!

Still, the feel of the writing is Harry Potter.  Yes, he is not there for much of the part that I was able to read, but there was still that strange mixture of down to earth business approach to ""herding"" magic that the various government departments have, and the incredible, glorious, astounding episodes and examples of magic that surface from the wands of various witches and wizards in residence in this tale.  I can hardly wait to get my hands on a full length copy of ""The Cursed Child,"" and I will ignore most of what I have mentioned as trying to the reader.  Yes, it is trying, but I love the Hogwarts world so much that I would put up with this and more to get to read a genuine J.K. Rowling story in the Potter saga, and from what I can tell, it truly is, even though she has taken on another writer.  The feel, the walk, of the story is Harry Potter, so if you like the Harry Potter saga, I'd suggest you get a copy.  I'm going to!

This story would have gotten 5 stars, I think, with better editing to remove the confusion in several spots.  Also, I only got to read the first act of FOUR!  If the writing lives up to past volumes in the series, it will certainly receive a 5-star rating from me!  The Potter series has always been so layered, so complex, that you could easily reread them and gain many insights unrealized before.  This is truly the fight of good against evil on an epic scale, and well worth any child's time to read, both as a thumping good adventure series, but also as a morality tale of incredible proportions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Baker","Don't let the negativity of some scare you away from a fun story.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","I'm not sure where all the negativity toward this is originating.  Perhaps it's people who aren't comfortable reading the play format.  Reality is, when you read a play, you are obviously not going to get the details of scenery, facial expressions, internal thoughts, etc., that you get while reading a book.  It's for that reason that this was by far the shortest of any of the Potter stories.  Did I miss some of that stuff?  Yep.  But it's a play.  It reads as a play.  And frankly, it was a good read and a great addition to the Potter story which Rowling has now announced is officially closed.  Dialogue in a play is different than dialogue in a book because more has to be conveyed just through spoken words and some body language--the body language obviously NOT appearing in the book.

I'm not going to give out spoilers and ruin this for others.  All I can say is that I am a die hard Potter fan when it comes to the books.  (I can't stand the movies as a whole because of how much they leave out from the books.)  I was so excited to get this book yesterday as an early bday gift from my husband.  I plowed through it in about 2 hours of actual reading time despite multiple interruptions from my kids.  I was in no way disappointed.

I preordered this book long before it came out. When there were issues with shipping from Amazon, I began hearing all of the backlash so I cancelled my order and requested it from the library instead. Because I had time to hear so much backlash and such, my expectations going into this were extremely low. Still, before I started reading, I made sure to get in the right mindset- totally open mind, not expecting much, etc.

Obviously, there were some issues.

It most definitely felt like a fan fiction more than a piece of work from J.K. Rowling. From time to time, I also felt that there were just so many things that were overlooked that this seemed almost like a rough draft, like it was very rushed. So I had issues with flow and the things just didn’t line up with the original series... They were all things that Rowling should have caught and fixed...Examples:

Using magic on Platform 9 3/4 in his third year- did they lower the age of magic outside of school grounds? Or does the platform count as school grounds?

Suddenly having Polyjuice potion available rather than taking the month to brew- Was that a mistake? Did potions improve so it was available faster? Why wasn’t that explained if so?

How they were in the library and then seemed to go straight to the girls bathroom, but suddenly Albus has Gillyweed…they must have made an off-stage stop. And Albus didn’t tell Scorpius what he was getting..?

Also, some of the dialogue wording seemed a little off, like there were words missing in some sentences.

There were also a handful of weird things that didn't line up with the characters. Like how simply Hermione hid an item that she knew was very dangerous in the wrong hands (she's brilliant, shouldn't she have hidden it better?!) I also really didn't like how Ron was portrayed the majority of the time... Sometimes he was good old goofy Ron, but others he seemed like too much of a doofus.

I also don’t understand the Part 1 and Part 2…was this play seen on two different days? The break between Part 1 and Part 2 doesn’t make sense…unless that marked the intermission of the play? But why title the book that way as well?

I straight up HATE that it is being called “Harry Potter Eight” “The Eighth Story”. Why couldn’t it just be a one off? Why did it have to be merged with the series? It’s not the same. If this was an actual novel that was fully written, I could see it being called book eight…but no. It’s a play and it was written by different people. It really seemed like Rowling only provided a weak outline.

All that said….I tried to take this as it was and not think to much about it. So overall, I actually really enjoyed this play!

Since it's the screenplay/play write there is not detail into what certain things would look like, for instance the neighborhoods, or the train, or the outfits.  You lose the guidance for your imagination.  I think the story line was predictable at times and other times you didn't see it coming.  It's obviously shorter than most HP books because of the formatting and lack of detail.  The first 25% was slow, very slow for me.  The next 25% was fast and interesting, the 3rd 25% was again slow and the last 25% was wonderful.  There are limited characters so that makes it a breeze to keep up with everyone involved.  If you're a HP fan, and followed all the previous books, you will enjoy this because you have a baseline for characters and their personalities to carry into your own imagination.  If you're not a fan and read the books, don't read this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Being that said I didn't read it when it first came out as there were SO MANY bad reviews. At the end at the start of this year I found myself in a deep Harry Potter groove, it was childhood all over again for me so I decided that I was going to read The Cursed Child as I was growing more curious about it, specially after reading that the play won so many awards.

Now, is this the best plot I've read in my life? No, definitely not and the ""shocking"" plot twist I saw it coming a mile away, I was more shocked for being so obvious and unoriginal that any other reason, I actually broke down laughing on how silly I found it. I read the book at least a  month ago and I had mixed feelings about it, so much that I actually started reading fanfiction of The Cursed Child and I found a GREAT one that continues on with the world The Curse Child introduces us to, the plot is MUCH better and the characters are very well portrayed so it took out a little of my frustrations with the play, BUT as time passed I kept coming back on how The Curse Child made me FEEL. From the start it wasn't so much about the plot, but more about the emotional journey of the characters and that is something I quite love and enjoy.

A lot of people complain about Harry being a bit ""dark"" (which sounds so much to the Star Wars fans saying that Luke is too ""hopeless"" in The Last Jedi) but that's life people!! In our own lives we experience hardships and bad moments, sometimes we grow to be a better person, others we do not, but either way the only way we grow is by being challenged and THAT is the core of Albus's story with his dad; their relationship is a challenge for both of them, not just to one another, but to also in an introspective way. We see how their lives have evolved, changed them and mold them. We have the Potters, and in the other hand we have the Malfoys and the difference is so great! We see how the hero (Harry) and the antihero (Draco) learned and grew out of the different experiences they had to live, how that shaped the relationship with their sons and how that affects EVERYTHING around them.

The lovely thing about The Cursed Child is not the main plot which I find dull, but the journey the characters are embarked on emotionally speaking, and how at the core of it all is the desire for family, to be seen and understood (even for the most unexpected characters); which is something we can all relate to. We have all being teenagers, we all KNOW how it feels when your parents don't see you, or you don't feel loved or understood by them, Albus's suffering is legit, despite being a little self-centered (like all kids at that age) and we see how Scorpius too deals with growing (and quite heart-wrenching) pains, but at the same time we see how they differ from one another and the different perspective both take on life.

Also I have to add that the ""big problem"" in The Cursed Child and that much people don't get is that this is NOT a book. A book, a novel is meant to be complete and whole on itself, it doesn't need anything else to be added. A script on the other hand is not, it is complete only when it is performed and showcased in front of an audience with its actors, scenery and music. I've been hearing the soundtrack created by Imogen Heap for The Cursed Child play and is BRILLIANT! If you love her credit song for Narnia: The Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe you will love the music she created for the play. Is mystical and magical, it takes you somewhere deep within you and into the story; I can totally see the different scenes matched up to her music and it just FITS. So maybe as a written experience The Cursed Child might not be much, but I feel that as a play is something else entirely, although I haven't seen the play, but just by hearing the soundtrack Imogen Heap created I have a deep desire to see it, as it truly transports you to the story, hopefully they will in time bring it so south america, 'cause it would be awesome to be able to be transported to that world, as I find the emotional journey of the characters VERY compelling so being able to see it on stage must be wonderful.

So my advice it this, if you like this type of stories with emotional load and character development, read it, I believe you will enjoy it. If you dislike that type of story and you want those BIG plot twist with an amazing story maybe it will not be of your taste, although everyone has their own definition of what an ""amazing story"" is, but comparing to the other Harry Potter books I say this pot is rather dull, but the emotional road is intense and I quite enjoy that; love character development in stories and Albus relationship with Scorpius is rather truthful and conflicted sometimes too, I feel it is very honest in the way it treats father and son relationships, family relationships, friend relationships, the relationship with yourself and your own darkness as well.

Also, if you have Spotify (or on Youtube) do look up Imogen Heap's soundtrack for the play, I bet that reading the script while hearing the music would be a profound experience, even if we can't see the actors performs, we can well see the characters perform in our minds.

Hope this review can help you all and as said in the title, if you are curious it doesn't matter what anyone else says, go and read it and is your choice if you enjoy it or not, you have the right to both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

That's like complaining that a new iteration of a batman comic isn't exactly faithful to previous stories. That's how things work in a fantasy world. They evolve over time.

Good story!","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2016","First off this is written as a play with the majority of the writing coming from Jack Thorne not J.K. Rowling; however, the writing style is very in sync with her other books.  This jumps around a lot more than a traditional novel with much shorter chapters if you will, because it is designed to be acted out on a stage in front of a live audience.  Coming in at just over 300 pages it was a quick and easy read.  The story line is actually not bad at all, though some seem to be throwing fits about it.  It takes a little getting used to reading this as a play, but it didn't bother me much at all.

I recommend giving this book a try.  It's actually well written with a viable story line and interesting plot twists.

It is a play based on a short story that J K Rowling wrote.  Just like the Potter movies change the plot and skip over massive sections of the novels, a play must have it’s own pace and style of writing.  It can’t cover all of the glorious detail the books could.
For me the play script was a lovely short story, sort of like another couple of chapters at the end of The Deathly Hallows.
If you didn’t enjoy the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, then this play is not of you.  It is hard to see the our beloved Hogwarts friends grow old and boring, I found that a little depressing at the end of such a wonderful series. This play helped me understand that it is OK.

In this story we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the Potter and friends' progeny, along with an exciting page turning adventure.  It’s use of the time turner is a plot device that allows us to view the ‘greatest hits’ from the book series.  I imagine the crowd cheering each time we see an old favorite character make an appearance, like an encore after a fantastic concert.

As a huge Potter fan, the play script helped me realize I have had enough of Harry and friends as adults. I realized that with adulthood Harry could no longer have the same sort of adventures his character had in the novels, he has kids and responsibilities.  It would be against his big hearted character to put those things at risk.  And after reading the first few chapters, I didn’t want him to.  I was more interested in what the kids were up to; they were interesting because of their well established back stories and I wanted to read more about them.  If you had asked me before I read The Cursed Child, I would have told you the opposite, I didn't want to read about the kids, I wanted more from Harry, Ron and Hermione.

If there is more of the Potter universe out there in JK’s mind, I’ll be happy to just know that Harry is still existing in it and that he is still an imperfect human, who makes bad decisions as a parent as he did as a kid, but is still pure of heart and every bit the hero from the novels. But if the adventures in that magical world continue without him, I will be delighted to read every last word.
I really hope this is a bridge to new adventures in Rowling’s magical world, it successfully established new Hogwarts' characters that I care about and want to see more of.  I struggled with the idea that the new Potter universe movie, 'Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them' will take place years before most of the familiar characters were even born, because I thought I needed our three original heroes, but now I am hopeful that Rowling’s magic will be more than enough!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It is a play who's story is based off JK Rowling and has input from her but she didn't write it. Knowing this before you read it is very important because I went in not expecting the level of development and creativity that Rowling has in her books and that allowed me to enjoy the book much more because I wasn't picking out the details that were wrong. THAT IS THE END OF MY SPOILER FREE REVIEW

Ok so like many books there were things I loved and hated about it
I loved…
most of the plot
pages 0-53 were amazing
SCORPIUS MALFOY IS THE MOST AMAZING JSCBJRJSLKHH
the look inside the past and different characters
the ending
VOLDEMORTS SECRET LOVE CHILD
slytherins
anything dark that happened in the script because it is very intriguing
harry and ginnys relationship
Rose Granger Weasley
Harry as head of magical law enforements
Hermione as minister
Astoria as a character
DRACOS PONYTAIL

I hated/disliked…
the abrupt character change with Albus
Draco and Harry becoming friends since they were dueling earlier and it seemed forced
Delphi just in general her plan didnt make sense
that Cedric could become a death eater just because he was humiliated at 17 like no he is a hufflepuff
TOO MUCH TIME TRAVEL
the trolley witch doesnt makeany sense
that weird i love you scene with dumbledores portrait
voldemort day
The diggeroys were too important in this play

I could write more but I think this is good enough if you are a harry potter fan this a must read just dont go into it thinking it will be the same as Rowlings writing also sorry if there are a lot of typos i wdoge this on a kindle paperwhite","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I miss J K Rowling's writing, yet, for the most part I enjoyed the play. I wish I could have gotten to know more of the characters; all of the children. I think there would be more depth if there was a novel written. I would enjoy delving into the characters more.
It was nice to visit most of the characters I love from the books. I did not find Harry full of angst; I enjoyed that he was a caring if a bit neurotic dad at times. I enjoyed seeing a new side to Draco- people do change. I enjoyed the time travel and thought the play was creative. I would like to see the play or a movie.

I think it was a pretty good story, but it's definitely a script of a play.  Everyone should know that by now, but judging by what I've read in some negative reviews, some people aren't used to reading plays.  Reading a play is a VERY different experience than reading a novel.  Yes, the story moves fast and there isn't as much depth.  That's because the whole story must be performed in a few hours.  You also have to be willing to put a whole lot of your imagination into reading it.  Thankfully, we're all very familiar with the world of Harry Potter. Also, honestly, we're missing out by not getting to see the staging.  A read play is never going to have the impact of either a well-written novel or a well-performed play. It's one of the reasons so many students struggle to read Shakespeare in English class, but then they go see a play and suddenly ""get"" why he's the greatest playwright in the English language.  Even though most people knew it was a script, I think they didn't really know (or remember from school) how different reading a play is.

Mild spoiler warning!

I also don't get why some people flat out refuse to believe that Harry might be a bad father.  He would want to be a good father, to be sure, but not all good people are good parents.  Especially when you consider that Harry has undergone a ton of trauma and has never really had a father.  One of the compelling things about Harry as a character in the other books was the fact that he was normal: he wasn't super-smart or the best wizard, he was flawed, and he sometimes made bad decisions which had real consequences.  The fact that this same character would grow up to be a man who isn't the best parent or spouse makes complete sense to me.

I get why some people are not thrilled with the Time Turner aspect of the story, but I think it was fun.  They really explored what changing time might do and how that all works.  It was taking one relatively minor plot point from the novels and playing with the idea a little more.  The alternate universes, so to speak, were also interesting to me.

Overall, I think this is a fun read, especially if you don't expect it to be something it's not.  Would I have preferred an eight novel?  Absolutely, but we've known for a while that we weren't going to get that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Miss the Details a Novel Would Have.","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2016","“Do you know there is a new Harry Potter book out?”  I have been asked this countless times over the past couple of months.  I did know there was a new Harry Potter tale out, but I knew it was a play that was opening in London and the script was being published as a hardcover – not as a narrative book.  I also know that J.K. Rowling said that the Harry Potter series stopped by book seven and I felt unwilling to move on from what had been promised.  Then I kept hearing snippets of all sorts of intriguing things happening in the Harry Potter world and I could not resist anymore and ordered the book.

I first fell in love with Harry Potter in my undergraduate years at Michigan Tech in the late 1990’s.  The first two books had been published and I heard great things about them.  I received them for a Christmas present and soon found myself engrossed in the tale.  Friends would laugh to find me in cubbyholes between engineering classes reading furiously.  I preordered each of the following novels and loved the entire series.  Was I ready to see what happened to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger 19 years later?  Yes.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child starts off right where book seven ended – with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione dropping their kids off to take the Hogwarts Express to school.  Harry’s middle son, Albus, worries that he will be sorted into Syltherin and his worst fear is realized.  He also befriends Draco Malfoy’s young son, Scorpius.  Harry and Albus struggle with their father and son relationship, especially when Harry tries to ban the friendship between Albus and Scorpius.  Albus feels adrift and decides to correct what he feels was his father’s greatest error by stealing a Time-Tuner with Scorpius and a new friend, Delphi.  They travel back to the Triwizard Tournament that was held in Book 4:  The Goblet of Fire.  Things don’t go exactly as planned and time goes amuck.  I thought of this as Back to the Future 2 after Biff goes back in time and screws up the future.  Will Albus and Scorpius be able to remain friends?  Will time go back to what it was or will dark forces be unleased?

I really enjoyed this play, and it really made me want to see it on the stage.  I hope it comes to the United States one day and/or gets turned into a fantastic movie.  It was a very engaging story.  I missed the great detail that is found in a Rowling novel and wished that she could turn this story into a full-fledged novel.  As it was a play, it was a very quick read.  This was welcome as my oldest son (10-year old Kile) started the Harry Potter series at the end of July and just finished book six today.  I realized I better get this review up as he will be reading this play before I know it!
My favorite quotes:

“Meet the once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.  I will leave you in peace, sir.  If peace is the right word for it.” – Mr. Diggory

“The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution.  Dumbledore.” – Harry Potter

“I don’t care what you did or who you saved, but you are a constant curse on my family, Harry Potter.” – Draco Malfoy

Do you enjoy reading plays?  What is the play you’ve enjoyed the most?

Are you a fan of Harry Potter?  Have you read The Cursed Child?  If so, what did you think?

Overall, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a great story.  I would have loved the detail that a novel would have contained, but the storyline was intriguing. I also loved the growth and different three dimensional view the storyline gave many of the characters, in particular, Draco Malfoy.

I read it in just a few hours and I actually really liked it. No spoilers, but I was more surprised by the beginning than the ending. I think what's missing to give it five stars is, you can't tell what any characters are thinking or feeling, you have to infer it because it's a play and you're the audience. It's not written from any of the characters point of view and that means you don't get any real incite to their motivations. I feel like there's too much assuming going on between the Scorpious and Albus relationship and at first I thought they'd eventually become a couple, because there's lots of talk of their friendship and hugging. That part is odd to me, but it doesn't ruin the book.

I love the Harry Potter books and characters, so I am glad for the latest story.

Albus Potter (Harry and Ginny's son) and Scorpius Malfoy (Draco and Astoria Malfoy's son) have to prevent time from being altered so that Voldemort doesn't win and change reality.

The good:  I enjoy time travel stories, and the idea of going back in time to correct things is interesting. I like how the story continues with next generation after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  The interaction between the characters,  especially Albus and Scorpius' friendship, is engaging.  I like how the characters (Harry, Albus, Draco and Scorpius in particular) feeling they have to meet everyone's expectations, their sense of inadequacy, and how they have grief to deal with is addressed.  The characters having to make the choice to do the right thing is there as it has been through the series.

The problems:  I would like to have seen more of Rose (Ron and Hermione's daughter) and Lily and James (Harry and Ginny's kids).  I wasn't sure what to think about Delphi's character either.  This didn't prevent me from liking the story however.  This is a play, so it is better to watch rather than read the story.  I would be interested in seeing this in novel form, and I do want to see the play when I have the opportunity, but I am going to have to wait until it comes to the States.

In the meantime, this is worth reading, and it works as a standalone story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_121?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=121&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Did I have a lot of little and, yes, some big concerns with some of the content? Sure. But I had to remind myself - as I hope others will as well when picking up a copy - is that this is not a work meant to be read but to be watched! Therefore a lot of the writing will seem weak to those who don't regularly read play scripts or screenplays - it's a completely different format that is not generally meant for the larger public to read. I'm sure that watching the live performance, with all the bells and whistles (and there are many in this piece) would totally distract from many of the things readers have grievances with.

The play is not really about Harry or Albus or Hogwarts and magic, but about families and their complicated dynamics. Although sometimes coming across as a Do's and Don'ts for parenting teens, I thought it was an incredibly sweet and charming play. Like the 7 novels that came before it, the play harkens back to the past to inform the future so it gives plenty to those HP fans who have missed the whole cast of characters and Hogwarts while keeping the narrative firmly planted in the frame of this new story. I think it's worthwhile if you're someone looking for a little something to assuage your Harry Potter cravings. My mom and I always read the Harry Potter series together, so I'm excited for my mom to read it and to be able to discuss it with her.

That being said, ***MAJOR SPOILERS***** I was a little disappointed that the limitations of what a Time-Turner can do were completely changed - if not altogether abolished - for the sake of this plot and not at all addressed within the play. And I didn't really feel that the time travel aspect was even necessary. Also I felt like many of the time references ""not since twenty-two years"", ""not in twenty years"", etc. were inconsistent - which is a minor complaint and would easily be overlooked when watching the play. However, I wouldn't be able to overlook the alternate reality created by Albus and Scorpious on their second attempt to alter the past was graphically horrific but lacked all the high stakes that the imagery required. The play described torture akin to or worse than many accounts of past, recent, and ongoing real world genocides but treated them all very lightly since, you know, the gang will correct the timeline anyway, right? But it was hard to read these scenes without feelings of intense frustration at their treatment.

I was also a little disturbed by the way that the character Delphi actively flirted with and otherwise encouraged Albus to fall for her and believe he had a chance at a romantic relationship with her in order to manipulate him. Because this is also too real, in my opinion, to just brush aside and not address further. In fact, the opposite is done and it's turned into a joke - first with Ron claiming he's glad to see the love potion he gave Albus was put to good use, then again when Albus is later teased by Scorpious for his interest in an older woman. But frankly, Delphi's manipulation of a teen boy's feelings and fluctuating hormones is disgusting and no different from the child sexual abuse so many young boys experience because of the narrative that ""boys can't be violated"" or that ""women can't be perpetrators"". And one might say, ""Well she was evil!"" Sure, she was, but her characterization as an evil villain had nothing to do with her role as a (however temporary) child predator. It was really gross and I wish Albus's feelings of having been used should have been further validated by someone. That's just my opinion.

With all that said, I want to reiterate that I did really enjoy reading this script and I can't wait for the opportunity to see it performed live!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_170?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=170&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I will be honest, I didn't want to set my expectations too high (despite waiting in line and attending a pre-lease party to grab the hardcover at midnight), so I did not reread the series this summer as I normally do, as readers should understand although Rowling is given some credit I give most credit to the other two, especially due to the format and style.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS, READ AT OWN RISK
Pros:
1. Personally, as a huge theatre geek I actually quite liked the script format, adding to why I rated this so high. Yes, I miss J.K. Rowling's writing and would prefer her for Harry rather than this, but I got used to the format. People must understand THIS WAS WRITTEN AS A PLAY and not a book, and that the printing of this just gave opportunity to muggles, witches, and wizards alike who don't have the chance to apparate, use floo powder, or fly (on brooms and planes alike) to see the show in London. Unfortunately, I do admit that because of the script format, it is also difficult to really immerse the reader into the setting.
2.  IT'S FREAKING HARRY POTTER. It was nice to see the old crew again. This book/script gave me the chance to fully be apart of and understand what it is like to wait in line, be part of crazy big crowds donned in costumes, and quickly read as soon as released. Plus, another story is another chance to read, well, another story based on a world so many have come to love.
3. Hermione as Minister for Magic. Yessss. Seeing her as a mean teacher was interesting too. Oh, and Ginny rocked as the voice of reason.
4. Scorpius! Love him. Also liked Draco and relationship with his son, and both their relationships with Astoria.
5. I liked how every little small thing the boys changed in time impacted the present.
6. Alternate worlds were interesting.
7. Giving props to old characters, little details that nodded to the series.
8. Harry and Albus, not so much their characters or shouting that they wish they didn't have each other as a father/son, but some of the raw relationship, such as being honest that the reason they don't understand one another isn't just because Albus is put into Slytherin.
Cons:
1. This story seemed more like fanfic.
2. The children besides Albus and Scorpius are introduced and then forgotten (besides Rose being savage). And I reallyyyy wished that there would be a main child/character who was in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, not just Gryffindor (Surprise! All kids except Albus from the main three are Gryffindor. No hate, I love all you guys, just babbling my opinions; it makes sense because of her their parents, but doesn't hurt to wonder).
3. Cedric becoming a deatheater because of his humiliation? Two best friends wanting to save him despite thinking about the consequences of messing with time? Oh boy.
4. What happened to our beloved characters? And the new ones? I understand that the format limits the description, but the dialogue sometimes... Ron as a comedic relief seemed to provide nothing to the story, make his character a bit corny, and his want of public affection with Hermione (not to mention Albus kissing his aunt because of this)? I don't know. Additionally, Albus seemed like a ""poor-me"" kid, Delphi seemed forced, etc ... Maybe it is just me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5. The whole freakout with Harry: ""I'm going to protect myself even if it means taking his only happiness, his friend Scorpius, because there is a black cloud over him. Also I am now threatening my previous professor-now-headmaster into watching his every move because she can't be busy with anything else."" I know it was a different world, and it was interesting; Harry doing anything for his son is believable, but I just couldn't settle on thinking Harry would go so far as to be so manipulative and threatening to his friends in a selfish (even though it was for his son) way.
6. Harry acting as/transfiguring into Voldemort. I don't think this was necessarily bad, I just don't know how to feel about it. I don't know how I feel about warrior Hermione or the fact that kids were able to get the time-turner from her office either (come on Hermione, you're smarter than that).
7. I feel there was this opportunity to show how the wizard world has changed since when the trio were students, and it wasn't used.

Okay, this is getting too long... phew. Thank you for reading, I hope my review didn't seem too whiny or dramatic! Overall, I think it is worth a read. I'll just leave it with this quote:
ROSE: The rumor is that [Scorpius] is Voldemort’s son, Albus.
It’s probably rubbish. I mean… look, you’ve got a nose.

M.","It's a Script, and Not a Final Script at That","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","Something a lot of reviewers seem to be missing is the designation as a ""rehearsal script."" In other words, this is what the play more or less looked like when previews began back in June, but not what's currently appearing in the West End. The whole point of rehearsals and previews is to figure out what works and what doesn't and eliminate the latter. The final script, with all the revisions, is supposed to be published next year. It takes a while to print several million books (Scholastic said their initial print run was 4.5-million), so the printed script was frozen weeks before the play, making it entirely possible that a lot of people are complaining about things that aren't even there any more.

As an actor, and sometime producer, the thing that struck me about this script is the complexity of the production. I honestly doubt you'll ever see community theatre productions, first because of the length, which is over five hours for both parts, and then because of the frequent scene changes and complicated stage effects. This is a play that can be staged with a budget in the millions, but you're probably not going to manage it if you only have a few hundred available for scenery, costumes, and props.

In any case, it's difficult to get a complete feel for this. As in just about any play script, there is very little in the way of description. Just a relatively simple indication of location and action, and the rest is carried by the dialogue. With a bit of luck, perhaps the West End production will be filmed and we'll be able to judge that as well. Or, perhaps, Rowling will decide to turn it into a novel and fill in what seem like gaps in a basic script.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Remember this is a play script so there are no colorful descriptions of location or of characters.  Sit down for 3-4 hours to read this straight through, use your imagination to see the Harry Potter world in your mind as this story unfolds and don't compare it to the books until you are done.  That way you can enjoy it for what it is and at times marvel at how are they doing the magic scenes on a stage during a live performance?!

Snape's character especially. I had a chance to read the negative reviews before I read the book- today is August 20th and I read the whole day- so was prepared for disappointments the early reviewers would be upset by.  I still have issues with Ginny and Harry.  And young Albus with his attitude certainly not as likable as Harry Potter .Nor would I be interested in Albus as a main character in other books - Draco's son was likable. This values and ethics in the book are what I expect from a HP book- value of  good friendship, loyalty, tolerance, acceptance, ethics, love, bravery,  hope, good vs. evil- to name a few.  Definitely a bit clunky and the shifts that being a play allowed were definitely annoying. But Harry Potter was still Harry Potter to me. Hermione was Hermione and Ron was Ron. Draco much more likable.

Albus and the rest could not have seen the Potters' house as it was protected by the Fidelis charm.  Voldemort could because the address was betrayed to him by their secret keeper.  Also there would be no present world to come from after seeing the blanket's message.  That world would have ceased to exist and one where the daughter didn't exist would have taken is place, which is a paradox, as she had to exist to not exist.

End of spoilers...

The characters were very thin. Harry was portrayed wrong.  The scenes were choppy at best.  It also reeks of Deus ex machina devices.  Overall I give it three stars.  I've seen worse fan fiction.

Rowling released The Deathly Hallows. Fortunately, the play offers up a new story in that universe, and not only allows fans a peek back into what once was, but also a peek into the future of what will be.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is at its heart a book about what if’s, particularly the one surrounding the death of Cedric Diggory that happened so long ago. The play revolves around that death and why it remains important in the legacy left by Harry Potter, and involves a time travel plot that is both wibbly wobbly and timey wimey. Because of that premise, it gives fans a chance to reconnect with previously beloved characters, but also gives them a chance to know new characters, including Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.

Particularly interesting is the relationship between Albus and Scorpius: although it seems unlikely that the two would ever become friends, it is their friendship that lies at the heart of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. This is a story about two boys trying to live up to the legacies of their fathers (or in Scorpius’ case, trying to rise above the rumors about him and his family). In the end, those legacies are impossible to live up to and create two main protagonists that readers will easily identify with.

Fans expecting a story about Harry, Ron and Hermione as adults, though, will probably find this a disappointing read. The trio’s stories have already been told: this is a new story about those who come after. Although Albus is a lot like his father, it becomes quickly clear that he’s also not Harry him in many ways. Fans will need to put all previous ideas aside because Albus is his own person.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, though, does leave out one character fans might expect to see: Teddy Lupin. There is no mention of Teddy anywhere, although Harry was the child’s godfather. This is a little disappointing, particularly for readers who want to know if he and Victoire Weasley ever got married.

Something else fans have already expressed a displeasure over is that this is not a novelization of the play, but a script. That’s important in reading the story because a script will read differently. For example, there are very few details given in a script as one might expect in a novel and it is up to the reader to fill in most of the blanks. That’s often difficult, especially for those who will not see the actual play where actors will fill in those spaces with their choices.

That aside, though, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a nice story that allows Harry Potter fans to revisit that world they love: at times it’s sweet – offering both laughter and tears – and is a worthy addition to any Potterhead’s library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I enjoyed the plot, and as it progressed the writing was fleshed out better.

Particularly earlier in the book, however, it was choppy, not ""deep"" enough, and negatively changed in ways from the HP 7 Epilogue, but these issues were mainly just distracting.  More concerning, the wording of sentences by characters well known across seven books was flat and not consistent with those characters as children or teachers, mainly in the early scenes. This is particularly noticeable with Hermione and Ron, where neither portrayed a personality early on as adults in the script,  as mature and animated as their child selves in the books. Professor McGonagall came across a bit silly and flakey in some scenes, something she never would have been accused of in any of the 7 novels.

Those things aside, the play developed very well, in my opinion, and had the right flavor of twists and turns in the play as the novels did.  The ideas and family bonds, as well as the strife, was consistent with what you might see between parents and children with the backgrounds they have, or stigmas they might carry due to association.

All in all, it was a good script and I think as improv and and general response is given to the viewings, the stage play will correct many of the faults seen in this version of the script book.  I will definitely endeavor to see it when it comes to the US.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Together, as their fathers before them, the boys manage to get themselves into a situation that could wind up having serious repercussions for the entire wizarding world.

The Cursed Child took some getting used to.  Because it is written as a play it was initially a bit difficult to read.  Additionally, due to the fact that it was a play the story just wasn't as fleshed out as I would have like it...I kept wanting more description of the world around the two boys, instead, I got stage directions.

With the above noted, it was quite enjoyable being able to re-enter the world of Harry Potter.  I liked the fact that this story seemed to follow many of the past trajectories of the previous tales in the series...in other words, we got to revisit places and expand (usually only slightly!) on people that have appeared in the previous books.

I don't know if Rowling intends more stories about Albus and Scorpius...but I would be very happy reading more tales about these two in the future.

For those who are completely enamored with the wizarding world of Hogwarts and muggles, aurors and dark wizards, this tale is a wonderful continuation of Harry Potter's story and definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_161?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=161&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I found myself wanting to hate this book, but I have to say I enjoyed it. Crazy stuff happens, and it has an engaging plot. True to the nature of a play, the dialogue gives the only insight to . . . everything. I would have preferred a regular novel written in J.K. Rowling's style, but this play was interesting nonetheless. Pleased with the ""8th Harry Potter.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Would love to see the play","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2016","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child follows Harry’s youngest son, Albus. We follow Albus throughout his first few years of Hogwarts. We learn that he has a not so great relationship with his dad, he’s an outcast at school, and his best friend is Malfoy’s son who is accused of being Voldemort’s secret son. Needless to say, Albus is not in a good place in this story. When he gets his hands on a time turner, he decides to go back in time to save Cedric Diggory’s life at the Triwizard Tournament. However, his desire to save Cedrick starts a chain of events that may actually bring back Voldemort in the present time and threatens the lives of those around him, including his own existence.

I have a confession to make, I did not read the Harry Potter books. I read the last book and that was about it, and that was mainly because I was so in love with the movies that I couldn’t wait for the last movie to come out in order to find out what happened next. I am also horrible at reading books that are not written as a novel. I tried reading a book once that was written in verse and I couldn’t do it. So, I was a little apprehensive going into this since you’re essentially reading a script. Thankfully, I had no problems getting in the correct mind-frame for the book. Sure, the italic parts that talked about people entering or exiting the stage took me out of the story, but it didn’t ruin it for me. There’s also a huge lack of internal dialogue, emotions, and a sense of connection with Albus since this is just a script. However, I still found myself rooting for him and his friend, Scorpius. I was still really invested in the story, even if I wasn’t emotionally attached to him as much as I would be if it were written as a novel. Basically, this would be a phenomenal novel and I would be all too happy if they made it into a movie.

Even though this is a script and we are not looking through the eyes of a specific character but rather getting glimpses of different characters during various time-frames, I found myself really liking Albus and Scorpius (Draco’s son). I mean, right from the start we watch as Albus makes his first run through 9 3/4’s, as he befriends a boy who is sitting by himself on the Hogwarts Express, a boy who’s all about eating the magical candy and excited to have a new friend, and we watch on as Hermione’s daughter sticks her nose up at Scorpius. It just took me back in time. Then to find out that Albus is both very much like his father and yet completely unlike him was mind-boggling. I mean, Harry seemed to do great at everything, and here we have Albus who can’t even get his broom to come up off the ground.

While Harry Potter and the Cursed Child does follow Albus and Scorpios on their journey both in the past and present, we also follow Harry as well. He knows his relationship with his son is not the best and he tries to find ways to mend it, but he goes about it the wrong way and ends up making matters worse. When he realizes the danger his son is in, he goes to some extreme lengths to bring him back. I’m not going to lie, I think a big draw to this book is being back with the gang. We get a lot of time with Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and even Draco. Draco was a huge surprise and one I really enjoyed. I’ve only ever seen him in a very unforgiving way, and in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, he’s the good guy! I wound up feeling for him and wanting the group to accept him as their own. He really took a 180 for me with this story.

One last thing I want to point out is that because Albus and Scorpios go back in time, we see what that means for present time. We watch as they live their current lives in the world they manipulated. Let’s just say that it never fully worked out since they kept trying to go back and change it, hoping for the outcome they wanted. For me, these alternate realities were really interesting and really showed you what could have been for Harry Potter and the gang if things didn’t go exactly as they did in the series. Plus, with going back in time we got to see some old favorites that are no longer around.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was surprisingly good. I didn’t think I’d be able to get into a script but there’s more dialog than there is directive, so it goes pretty smoothly. I would love to see this as a play but more importantly, as a movie. I mean, it’s not like they’d have to cut things out to meet a time max for the movie, and they wouldn’t even need to really adapt it! Just saying, I would totally see it in theaters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Although I had known ahead of time that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child wasn’t a book, instead it was a script, and that a great deal of the story itself wasn’t penned by J.K. Rowling, I was so thrilled to be having a new Harry Potter story nine years after the final book was released. How could we not be? This was our childhood. Hogwarts is our home. Because of all the spoilers that had leaked to Twitter upon the plays previews, I had low expectations from the start and I think that is why I loved (yes, loved) The Cursed Child as much as I do.

Far from my favorite release in the series, The Cursed Child is every bit as darkly magical as the previous seven full-length-novels. It took me back to my childhood. It reminded me what it was like to be so bloody excited for a book release, I barely nodded off whilst reading it and stayed up far later than I’d normally. There was something in it being the first Harry Potter story to have purchased with my own money, as many people from my generation have expressed. Midnight release parties, Freeform’s beloved Harry Potter Weekend and more played out to the tune of my weekend during its release date.

I felt younger again. I felt happy. You know that feeling, right? Tingling in your veins as you finally get your hands on a physical copy of something you love. Most of us hadn’t felt it since 2007–and I can’t explain how wonderful the sensation was after being from it for so long. My review would have come sooner but as I don’t have a laptop (still) and I couldn’t articulate what it was I wanted to say, here we are almost a week after its release.

Better late than never? Anyways. Let’s tackle the flaws first. There are a lot in the plot, but for the most part, it’s a highly enjoyable tale. Simple and to the point. I’m sure the fact that it’s a script makes it easier for readers, or more difficult (that depends on who you ask) and I will say there’s a lot of things that felt… well, off. These flaws and questions (Delphi’s childhood, the logic behind it, all that time travel, Harry’s behavior towards Albus and more) can be quite distracting for the fans. I get where they’re coming from, really I do, but no work is without flaws and if you choose to not want to read The Cursed Child, no one will blame you.

Just don’t let yourself ruin the original series. This play, this script and new take on a now-middle aged Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy, doesn’t hold that power. I repeat: it doesn’t ruin the series. You’re only psyching yourself out in that regard and if you love it, you’ll hold onto it and just pretend this eighth story isn’t around.

Each fan who enjoy the story, each fan who finds their head canons damaged a bit by this new tale, each fan who doesn’t–you have the choice to not let it ruin something you love. So, please, hear me out: Stop acting like you have to love it or you have to hate it or you have to acknowledge it.

It’s okay.
It’s okay to love it.
It’s okay to hate it.

That being said… I was pretty excited to see a context to all those spoilers that came out and found that while some of these things deeply upset or confused me, reading them and seeing what leads into them made them into something much better than I thought. I know a lot of people are throwing hissy fits about Harry’s treatment towards his son, Albus, but here’s the thing guys–it’s not in black and white. It’s not okay how either of them acted towards each other.

Harry Potter, the boy who lived through so much, isn’t always going to take the rational route. When has he ever? With his upbringing, with all that is in the past, he isn’t always going to do or say the right thing. It’s frustrating but understandable.

And the most important thing was that he tried. He tried to set it right. He tried to repair things. The Cursed Child was about change and mistakes and how to right our wrongs. Can’t you see that? Harry made a lot of piss poor judgments in the original series and still does so because that’s part of being a god damned person.

Even wizards.

Get it?

It's part of humanity. It's part of living.

But Harry Potter knows how to get a grip, even if it takes him a while to get there. He is no longer a boy, but sometimes our childish reactions stay with us. And that was just another point–that and to emphasize that he and his son, Albus, are incredibly alike.

That being said–I love Albus and the fact that he was sorted into Slytherin! I loved his friendship with Scorpius. I thought that the dynamic was interesting and new but still had this nostalgic quality to it, like the friendships Harry had with Ron and Hermione (which are still, thankfully, intact) and I loved seeing the differences of Draco and Scorpius. Scorpius isn’t at all like the Malfoys we’d seen in the series, thus making the family a bit more… I don’t know how to explain it, really, but it was just great seeing a Malfoy not be vilified.

(Even if people are, naturally, suspicious of him and there are malicious rumours which follow him about his parentage.)

Scorpius is a precious cupcake, basically. I also thought that it was great to see in spite of how much has changed, how Draco has adapted into adulthood, how Harry has grown, the past is easy to fall into. I liked seeing Harry and Draco together in scenes, both as the grown men that they are, and seeing them clash only to eventually work together. I loved that Hermione is the Minster for Magic and there's this scene where everyone is at her side: Harry, Ginny, Ron, Draco. I finally saw how interesting that dynamic would/could be and it was just a great addition to the entire story.

I also liked the alternate universes. How one action can change everything. How terrible the world could have been. It held a lot of devastation on different levels and I just thought it was fascinating. In particular, I loved the world in which that complete cow Umbridge was around, Voldemort ruled and Severus Snap, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were all around as a rebellion. I hated it for obvious reasons but still found it highly interesting to see this world and what would have happened had the war not been won in the good guys favor. It made my skin crawl, you know?

Although time travel is outdone and a bit all over the place, I enjoyed it.

I thought that some of the rules regarding it were a bit lax and nonsensical but it was still a decent plotline. Minus the scene in Godric’s Hollow when Harry was just a baby and well, we know what happened that October when Harry was orphaned–it was awful seeing this scene again, from a different angle with a much more tragic vibe to it if you can imagine such a thing.

To avoid spoilers for those who haven’t read, I will say you need your tissues handy or else you may literally drown in your own tears. I'm surprised the ink in my book didn't smudge because I was straight up crying and am still getting a bit emotional over thinking about it.

As for everything... I do wish it had been a full length novel and I do think that seeing the play performed on stage, or adapted in some other way, would make the story itself translate better. I hope one day they release a film based upon it or just record a performance of the stage production. I do think that it captured the magic wonderfully and that the flaws are far and wide but it doesn't take away from it for me, personally.

Overall, I thought it was solid.

Perhaps my least favorite set in the wizarding world it still is a lot more fun than it’s given credit for. I loved the reveal of the main villain, I loved the time travel bits and all the familiar faces. There’s one scene in particular between Harry and Dumbledore’s painting that stuck with me and I found myself a little surprised at the trio being, well, adults.

I didn’t really want a Harry Potter sequel, but it was all over the place (and the cover is gorgeous) so I caved, and ended up being pretty happy that I did!

I quite enjoyed this book despite some of the issues I had with it. In relation to the original seven Harry Potter novels, there are some inconsistencies, or things I don’t necessarily think fit with the characters. However, I loved the new characters, and enjoyed the story on it’s own.

This plot…as much as I know it was a bit crazy and unrealistic, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it. There were points where I was thinking, “You know, even for fantasy this is pretty far-fetched…” but there was something that kept me hanging on. I could have done without the repeating of certain moments in time. I’m also not the biggest fan of covering such a large time span in single novels, and in this case the book followed Albus over the course of a few years. However, it was still enjoyable to me. It wasn’t a tough read, and to be honest, I didn’t see some of the twists coming. I won’t mention which ones because I like to keep my reviews spoiler free, but there were some moments where I was surprised, moments I called, and moments I felt were a little far-fetched. Maybe it’s the nostalgia factor, but this book still left me feeling all warm and fluffy inside.

 I absolutely loved Albus and Scorpius. I thought their friendship was fantastic, and I wanted to adopt Scorpius. I also loved the fact that Albus was a Slytherin, and the role that played in his identity. Albus’s awkward nature and Scorpius’s insecurities, combined with both of their parent-child relationship issues made them very relatable to me, and I loved seeing their relationship develop over the course of the story and through the various timelines that are explored. As I said, I really didn’t want a story about Harry Potter’s children, let along Draco Malfoy’s as well. I was surprised at how quickly and strongly I got attached to them. Again, closing the book felt like saying goodbye to friends, and I think this was largely do to the lovable characters.

The original Harry Potter characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, etc.) felt off to me. One of my friends said it felt as if the characters themselves were acting, and at some points I’d have to agree. I especially felt Hermione’s character was different, which disappointed me since I looked up to her (despite her obvious flaws) so much as I watched the movies as a kid, and eventually read the books in high school. As far as Harry’s character, I did like how he changed overtime as he was learning to be a good parent. I personally related to his bumpy relationship with Albus (as I’m sure a lot of other readers have as well) so I liked reading about them trying to learn to navigate their relationship.

As far as style, there was nothing much that really stuck out to me in this book, and I think that’s another one of the disappointing factors for me. There were no “woah” moments or quotable lines. Overall, it read pretty average, but that may be because of the play form I’m not used to reading. I’m not sure how it’s performed so maybe that would make a difference. Until I’m able to see it, though, who knows…

The biggest complaint I have about this book is how it fits in relation to the original seven books. I felt like I was reading about different characters rather than the ones I spend seven years with, and it was a bit disappointing. I also wasn’t sure how, while actually being performed, the set would work since it seems to change every few pages, but that’s more of a question than a review-worthy point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling’s play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, billed as the eighth Potter story, was released on July 31st.  Naturally, I and the world and his dog rushed to pick up a copy.  Here are my thoughts.  I should point out that I have not seen the play, worse luck, and am going from the script alone.  Note that there will be total and complete spoilers, which I will hide after the cut.

First, the non spoilery section. There was a lot I loved about it, and some things that didn’t work nearly so well for me.  I loved that the same themes that pervaded the book series – love, friendship, family, loyalty – still form the core of Cursed Child.  It was wonderful seeing how Harry, Ron and Hermione coped with adult life and parenthood (being an adult myself, it was especially fascinating.). The new characters, Scorpius and Albus and their friendship are completely adorable – Scorpius really does get all the best lines.  And, naturally, it is simply wonderful to revisit the Wizarding World in any shape or form.  Rowling’s world is utterly breathtaking.  I really wish I could see how certain scenes played out on stage.

What I didn’t enjoy so much were certain plot points.  I didn’t feel they gelled too well with what we know about the Wizarding World and the characters in it.  Some character development points I didn’t feel worked too well in a play setting.  They might have worked better for me in novel format with more space to expand and develop them.  Also, while it’s not necessary to have devoured Pottermore, certain interactions do have much more meaning if you are aware of some of the character’s backstories.

All in all I enjoyed Cursed Child and gave it four stars out of five.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts One and Two Playscript based on a story by J.K. Rowling by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne. Pottermore Publishing July 25, 2017.

Amazon’s Blurb: The official playscript of the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.
While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.
The playscript for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a 'special rehearsal edition' alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from theatregoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller.
This definitive and final playscript updates the 'special rehearsal edition' with the conclusive and final dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece between director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and insights about reading playscripts. This edition also includes useful background information including the Potter family tree and a timeline of events from the Wizarding World prior to the beginning of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

My Review: I have mixed feelings about this play. On the one hand, I enjoyed it. On the other, there were some plot stretches that seemed a bit much. I don’t want to spoil too much but what bugged me the most was a supposed match that resulted in a pregnancy many years in the past. It just didn’t seem plausible according to what was going on in the timeline of the books and movies, imo. The book takes place when Harry is about 37, raising a family of three, married to Ginny Weasley. When the father of Cedric Diggory comes to Harry who is now head of the Ministry of Magic, Harry’s younger son, Albus, doesn’t understand why Harry refuses to use one of the Time-Turners to go back in time and save Cedric from death. When Albus teams up with Scorpio Malfoy to do just that, all hell breaks loose.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I held off on reading for a while as a strike, but finally gave in.

Story started out rough in my opinion because it was difficult to see the characters I grew up with in these new roles. That said, I couldn't stop reading, finishing same day.

The Potter-esque magic, storyline and heart-lifting message that captured my loyalty in prior years started to pick up mid-way and finished strong leaving me happy I read the book and even hopeful for another one to come out (even if it is another screenplay).

I did drop one star because of the screenplay medium versus a novel. Though I realize a screen play is meant to put on a show, which I'm sure was decent (special effects in Potter can't be under-valued); by mass-printing the screen play Rowling and team must have realize that more people would read the play rather than go see the production, so why use a medium (screen play) that doesn't fully utilize language to provide the depth and even the edification that a novel does?

Revisiting familiar places, people and events the Cursed Child is a nice catching up with old friend and also some perceived enemies. Harry, now grown with three kids of his own sends his second son Albus off to Hogwarts. Who he meets there, the friends he makes and the things he gets up to well… you’ll have to read the book if you want to know because I will not give away anything here.

Written as an Official Script book for the play, this definitely reads slightly differently than the previous installments. After taking a few pages/scenes to familiarize myself with the formatting I think I actually preferred this format for the purpose of this story, it worked very nicely. The scenes are sketched in basic format and it is left to the reader to fill in the blanks… as grand or minimal as you like. Clocking in an a little over 300 pages, I’m fairly certain that if this were a traditional novel we would have been looking at closer to 500 pages.

 After reading “Cursed Child”, I find myself nostalgic for the Wizarding World and would love to see more installments of the grown up Hogwarts alum and the new generation of wizards. As far as if that will become a reality, I guess only Professor Treylawney knows for sure; but  I would definitely be game for seeing the stage production if it ever makes it stateside.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_163?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=163&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I couldn't wait to jump right in to Part Two and while I'm sure it is incredible on stage, reading it just didn't really do it for me. If anything it's killing me that I have no set plan on how im going to see the stage production in the near future because there are so many times reading the play where I can't even imagine how they are pulling this off on stage. It's inevitable that a script of 300 pages did not live up to the level of detail and story found in the novels of which some were over 700 pages. While Part One literally leaves you shocked, Part Two felt all too familiar to me and pulled very heavily from ideas from some very big films that have come out since the last Harry Potter book. Naming them would push into spoiler territory but you'll know what I mean. Of course in good conscious I couldn't rate this less than four stars because I would take anything Harry Potter and am excited JK Rowling isn't finished with the Wizarding World just yet.

Second, even though the script's story-line is a collaboration between 3 authors and not just JK Rowling, I still thought it was an entertaining read.  Third, this book is less about magic and more about the relationships between the characters.  But it wouldn't be a Harry Potter book if there isn't at least a magical adventure; in this case, with the time-turners.  Because time-turners are involved, of course this script is going to hash over previous events from previous books.  Forth, this book follows Harry Potter's son, not Harry Potter.  Given the format, story-line, multiple authors, and point-of-view, this book will have a different feel from the rest.  I took a star off because I would have preferred a longer book in novel format with more details.  The script was too short.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Were you expecting the 8th enstallment to the Harry Potter series? Were you thinking this would be written like a novel by JK Rowling chronicling the future of the wizarding world?

The title of the book itself clearly states *none* of these things. It is upfront in that it is *based on* an original story by Rowling BUT is not written by her. It says it is parts 1 & 2 of a screenplay, yes a play, called the cursed child. Meaning it is not a part of the first 7 Harry Potter books. And it is also written as a screenplay, not the usual novel form past HP books were written in.

No, the characters do not have the magic or come to life like in other books written by Rowling because *she did not write this*.

For what the book is, it isn't bad. It gives fans a look into the world of magic after Harry Potter's life at Hogwarts. If you are a die hard fan, keep in mind this is not the 8th book, Rowling did not write it, and do not expect it to follow her way of writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Goes fast.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2016","Despite the size and being in script form, it was actually a really engrossing and fast read which first begins where the 7th book's epilogue ended. I found a lot of the returning characters seemed to be a little, or in some cases quite a lot, out of character from the original series of books in ways that couldn't always be explained away by being older now and having more life experiences. Though, some of them could be and I liked those changes quite a bit.

Some characters we get much more insight into than we did in the original series and their changes make a lot of sense due to that insight. Perhaps the changes that didn't make sense were because of a lack of that sort of insight. There were also a few plot holes I noticed but nothing that was annoying. It's probably important to note that even though this is a book you can pick up and hold, it is really just a script for a play and isn't meant to be considered in the same way a novel would be.

The new characters are engaging and have their own distinct personalities and issues and struggles and are fun to read about. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy especially, which is a good thing considering that they're the main characters for this.

This is an exciting, touching addition to the original series and I find that my money and time were well spent on it. I would absolutely recommend this book. The only reason this doesn't get full stars from me is because I docked a star (I would have docked only half if it would've let me) for the returning characters whose OOC-ness* didn't really get an adequate explanation.

*OOC = Out of Character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_134?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=134&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I cannot give it 5 stars, simply because it was not written by J.K. Rowling herself. I did enjoy reading the script, but I do wish it had been a novel.
Some of it was rushed quite a long, but if nothing else, this was a great piece of Harry Potter cannon, authorized by the creator herself.
I read it in a day.

Shanahan","Canon...adjacent? (Spoilers for the plot)","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2017","I was 17 when Deathly Hallows came out so I grew up with Harry Potter like a lot of these reviewers.  I own all the audiobooks and listen to them frequently.  I was so excited to hear a play would be brought to life and even more so that those of us without a hope of seeing it live in London would still get a chance to read the new story through the published rehearsal script.

I continue to have mixed feelings about the story as a whole.  There are parts I adore about this story, such as Scorpius being the greatest child ever, Draco admitting to his lonliness and vowing to bring his son up differently than how he was raised, the struggle Albus feels carrying the weight of his father's legacy and pressure to succeed.  And then there are parts that I struggle to reconcile with what I know and love about the HP series.  I cannot fathom the idea of Voldemort having a child - consensual or not, magical intervention or not - with anyone.  I can't imagine any amount of public humiliation at the Triwizard Tournament that would turn Cedric into a Death Eater and kill Neville at the Battle of Hogwarts.  I can't imagine Harry ever saying he sometimes wishes Albus weren't his son.  Even if he regrets it immediately, I'm not sure I could see him going that far even in the heat of the moment.

I had issues with the mechanics and plot holes that time-turning caused in Prisoner of Azkaban and had many of the same issues with the time-turning in this story as well.  I felt quite a bit like the entire hidden purpose of having a story involving time travel was just a way to bring back old characters for the fans to see again, although I don't feel any characters were done any real justice by that so it was often awkward.  Most of the characters felt at least a bit *off* to me; close to their canon personalities but not quite right.  I started referring to it as 'canon-adjacent'; it's easy to say it's a fan-made telling of Harry's future if that's easier to accept, but for a lot of people it's also a perfectly acceptable addition to the series.  Accept the parts you like, and continue to daydream and rework the parts you don't.  Fiction allows that kind of freedom for headcanon.

I would love the opportunity to see it performed live.  While this wouldn't change the issues I had with the plot, it would definitely be a more well-rounded experience with the story overall and I think I'd have a better appreciation for the story presented in a completely new medium for the HP canon.  I think I could forgive some of the more absurd points if I had a more complete picture of the experience, with the atmosphere and magic - both literal and figurative - I associate with the series as a whole.  I'm definitely saving my pennies for when it makes the trip to Broadway!

Overall, I flew through the book and enjoyed the experience of dipping my toes back into the world of Harry Potter after so many years of having no new material, but it's clear this was a fan work and not the complete brainchild of Jo Rowling.  Her approval and backing of it tells me that she's at least behind this tell of the future of her characters even if she didn't write it, which is a bit tough to think about given how different parts of it feel.  However, I don't think it's fair for me to do what so many fans have done by completely trashing it and writing it off.  I think it's given the fandom overall a new thing to discuss and debate and love (as many people do!) and that's important.

In this book, it tells us how the characters from the famous series of Harry Potter grow as an adult and how they handled their new life as a parent. Together with that, this book also shows us about the struggle of Albus Severus Potter (son of Harry and Ginny Potter) and how he and Scorpius Malfoy (son of Draco and Astoria Malfoy) became best of friends.

I loved this book even if this is not as awesome as the other books in the series. That amazing feeling you get when you read this is priceless. I know I’m not the only one who was shocked when we get to know the secrets of the past that even Harry and his friends weren’t aware. And it is kind of surprising too because I don’t have any idea that it is possible – which is really impossible to happen.

The characters are awesome, especially Scorpius Malfoy. I liked how he handled the situations. As for Albus, he is cool too, but I mostly noticed Scorpius in the story so yeah, I can’t praise him enough. And there’s the trio we will never – EVER – forget! They already have their own family here, and well, I think they changed a bit. They are not the trio we’ve known for so long, but, nonetheless, it never destroys how I imagined the story. Also, why should I forget Draco (My book boyfriend, shhh) and how he really changed for the better. He shows me how awesome he is like a father to Scorpius and that’s really something. He is the only character that shows big improvements here, unlike the trio that’s kind of still the same as they were before.

The plot and concept are good but, some of it is a forced one – if you get what I mean, it is like they just put it there because they just want it. And, I’ve got some problems too about some parts of it like the scene where polyjuice potion was suggested by Albus and… I won’t give any more details here as it might spoil some of you who haven’t read this yet.

Overall, this is a magical gift from my favorite author. I get to enjoy the ride again to Hogwarts, but this time it is not focused on the trio but on their children. Even if this is written in a play format, I was still able to enjoy it. Very recommended to everyone, especially to those Potterheads!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In this new installment, Albus struggles with his famous father’s legacy.  With his BFF Scorpio Malfoy, he schemes to steal a time turner to go back to the Triwizard Tournament to save Cedric Diggory.  Two inexperienced adolescent wizards playing with time is bound to go bad, and when they change history, mayhem ensues.  The time travel device could have gotten confusing, but I think it was well done here.  When the boys realize the consequences of their meddling, the adults get involved to try to prevent Voldemort’s victory.

Was this book a necessary addendum to the stories we already know and love?  Not really.  Was it entertaining and nice to revisit our favorite characters?  You bet!  Though it wasn’t as thoroughly engrossing and endearing as Rowling’s novels, it was still a fun return to the wizarding world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Let me start off by saying that if you're expecting the ""world of Harry Potter"" in this book, you will be disappointed. The format does not lend itself to description. Its a play, not a novel. The depth and complexity in the characters and setting isn't there.  Also the reader needs to know the backstory before reading. It would be difficult to follow and/or get a deeper meaning from this story not knowing about the books. In this book, we find Harry as an adult with all the responsibilities and scars that a 40 year old parent can have. This definitely isn't the adventure story we Harry Potter fans are used to. That being said, I enjoyed every single bit of it. In fact, I loved it.

Some things to note: I think to really enjoy and understand this book, it helps to be a parent of a certain age. One of the reasons I think this play resounded with me is that Im a 45 year old parent who has teenage kids. Like Harry I've made parenting mistakes - some of them very costly.  Thankfully, Ive been lucky and have worked hard to come around the other side of some of those mistakes.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a redemption story. Its about the baggage we carry in our lives and how it's passed along, many times unwillingly, to our children. It's a story about the complexity of relationships and how they shape and mold the people we become. Lastly, this story is about acceptance and love and how sometimes it takes a crisis to make us realize what's really important.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_153?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=153&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I get why people think it was disappointing, and they're not wrong - it did read a bit like a fanfiction (a mediocre one at that), and the plot fell a bit flat. But to be honest, I don't think Harry Potter's original plotlines were as wildly original as people seem to think they were. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Harry Potter, and I do think the original canon was better than this book - just not by as much as everyone else seems to think.

I liked the characters. I thought Scorpius was quite charming. Some of the original characters fell a bit flat for me - especially Ron. I'm not really sure what happened with Ron, but his role in the story was so minor that it didn't stick out to me. I wasn't over the moon over the plot, and it was predictable to me, but there were parts I really appreciated.

This book felt like a Harry Potter book to me, if only because I was as swept up in the reading of this book as I have ever been with one of the earlier Harry Potter book. It brought me back to being in high school and waiting for the books and movies to come out, being at the bookstore on midnight the day of release, and the glorious anticipation of waiting to find out what happened next. As a standalone story, this book is decent and would probably get three stars - but I gave it an extra star for the nostalgia factor. So I liked it. I would recommend it to any of my Harry Potter fan friends. Plus, it doesn't take long to read a play - so you may as well give it a go. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

From that time onward, however, I have been a unabashed Harry Potter fanatic. And I truly don't understand the hate this is getting. Some of the most common complaints I've seen:

1. The script format - Well, read the description before making the purchase. It hasn't been a secret that this was the format Cursed Child would take.

2. It's too short - Yes, the script format makes for a quick read. But if the stories were as long as I'd like them to be, I'd never resurface from reading them.

3. Harry is wildly out of character - There are 20-some years, 3 children, and a career between the last time we saw Harry and this story. Did anyone truly believe we'd get the same angsty teenager we last saw in Deathly Hallows? Are you the same person you were even a year ago? Perhaps it would have been helpful to have a few glimpses of what made Harry into the person we see in Cursed Child, but it's really not that big of a leap to see the Harry we're familiar with in this older version. Same goes for the others - Hermione is still HBIC, I fell in love with Ron all over again, and Draco - well, he was a satisfying surprise. They've just all grown up.

Would I have preferred a story centering more on Harry, Ron, and Hermione and their lives now? Yes. Did I want to see more of how the Wizarding world had (or had not) changed in the aftermath of Voldemort's demise? Sure. But here's the thing - there was plenty I would have changed about the other seven stories as well. None of it changes how much I love them and this universe that JK Rowling has created. The story is still one of love, family, and friendship - and for me, that's what I had always valued in the Harry Potter stories most of all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Unfortunately, no book could live up that kind of hype, let alone this one. Labelling Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as the ""official eighth story"" likely did the biggest disservice to itself. Yes, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is written (at least partially) by JK Rowling and is set after the Nineteen Years Later scene of the final (at the time) Harry Potter book. However, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not really the continuation of a seven-book series with an overarching and interconnected plot. It is the script to a play that happens to tell a story connected to the prior seven books, with input from the original author of said books. However, it is also the work of two other people and as a script is also intended to be seen performed. This is all important to consider when reading this book, because expecting too much from it is going to leave you disappointed.

As mentioned prior, this is the script of the play being performed in London. The play, directed by John Tiffany, and written by Jack Thorne, with the story worked on between Tiffany, Thorne, and Rowling. Taking place from where Rowling left off the last Harry Potter book, it follows Harry, now all grown up and with a family. Of this family, the story focuses on his youngest son, Albus Severus Potter as he starts his enrollment at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. However, things are different for Albus than they were for his father: he is sorted into Slytherin, befriends a Malfoy, and has to deal with fame in a different way (Harry was famous for his actions, Albus is famous for the actions of another). The play then delves into the relationship between parents and their children. When Albus finds a way that he thinks he can fix something tragic that happened in the original books, he ends up involved in something much more complicated than he imagined.

On its own merits, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child's story and characters are strong. The central characters of Harry, Albus, Scorpius, Draco, and Delphi are complex, and the story delves well into exploring its themes. These characters all have something straining their relationship with their family or how society views them in light of them family. This will resonate well with those have had similar struggles with their family. In addition, the story takes several twists and turns, and the format makes it easy to get through the story and see how it unfolds.

However, it's when taking in it's story and characters in the view of being part of a larger universe that some of the flaws in the story become apparent. On the one hand, the characters all feel accurate to their characterization from prior books, but as much older adults. For example, Harry is well-meaning and does what is right, but is often distracted with his personal problems and life that he often makes mistakes. Ron is a funny uncle and doting husband, but knows when to just stand by his wife, Hermione, and let her take care of things in her new fitting position as Minister. However, most of the original main cast takes a sideline in this story, with Ron and Ginny in particular not really doing much in the story (and Ginny's arc in the previous books was that she became someone who could stand up and do something when needed). In addition, some new details about the setting are revealed, and some of them feel a little odd. The big reveal about the antagonist's identity in particular seems a bit odd. It feels out of character with someone from the original series. It ties into the play's main themes, but does feel fan-fiction-y in logic. Though it is explained second-hand, so it isn't a stretch to infer it as not as true of a reveal as originally lead to believe.

Another important thing to remember is the format. This is the script of a play, and one from the rehearsal period. This means that there are rewrites that occurred between when this version was performed during the previews and when the play officially opened (this was done presumably so the script could be printed and released the day the play opened). In fact, the revised script will be released later next year. Also, while blocking instructions do exist, this is a script and not a prose novel. This was and is intended to been seen as a performance. However, as this play was incredibly hyped and most people can't afford tickets to London to go see the play, the script was released as a more accessible version. Like other plays, this makes it easier and more accessible to consume, it is arguably inferior to seeing full performance.

One's enjoyment of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child depends mainly on how much they're willing to go into reading it without expectations as an ""eighth story"" in the Harry Potter universe. It does not work as a part of the seven books that preceded it, but as a separate work still connected to what came before. Be willing to accept that, and you'll find a compelling story about family and the struggle to connect, just where the family is Harry Potter's.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_121?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=121&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I had a fun time reading it, really couldn't put it down. As other reviewers have said, it reads more like a piece of fan fiction and that's really what it feels like. Nonetheless, it's a good piece of fan fiction. I enjoyed it a lot. If it was missing some of the soul of the series, I knew that going in, because J.K. didn't write it. But seriously, with the effects and everything, this play seems like it's going to be amazing. There's a big part of me that wishes this had been fully fleshed out into a novel. It would add the detail that we're used to in Rowling's books. That being said, I really thought it was great for what it was.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_167?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=167&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Certain moments were a bit ""fan-fictiony"" but as a screenplay this could be attributed to the way going wizards would talk. Moving quickly through the story did lend to some wanting of more detail or end tied up more fully. However, this could be due to the fact that it is a play and the cadence of writing is bound to be different.

J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer, and her books are engaging, witty and cleverly written. This book had an interesting storyline, and was a nice addition to the Potter story, but it was not QUITE as good as previous stories. I'm not sure if I was thrown off by the different energy it takes to read the lines in the play, the fact that J.K. was not the primary author so the ""voice"" was different, or the fact I was just left feeling like more could have been included.

The tone was captured, and in general the script picks an interesting theme and topic, and again, familial love is very prevalent for this as well. At it's best, it's a compelling script that will hopefully get young people to consider theatrical scripts a serious art form and make fun to read. At it's worst, it gives a great Harry Potter flavor, but without JK's exposition in between dialogue (the format is mostly dialogue with a few lines of stage direction in each scene. Most scenes are short!) the story doesn't really seem all that substantive. Again, this is all just on the page. The beauty of the script is that so much of it seems 'unstageable'), it really makes me want to see it live!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was very hesitant to read this as I have such amazing memories associated with the original books. I am also prejudiced against trying to draw out stories long past their expiration. But, curiosity got the better of me! Although it lacked, for me, the magic of the originals, I found it to be an interesting story and really did a good job continuing the characters.

The story follows Albus, son of Harry. He is a child who is struggling with his identity as the son of a hero. He befriends the son of Draco and sets out to fix some of his father's mistakes.

Rowling and the creative team behind Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and it almost struck me as meta-commentary that the story ends up being about Albus struggling in Harry’s shadow. This is a play that’s immensely aware of the shoulders it is standing on, and that tries for better or worse to embrace its difficult position.

Personally, I felt it succeeded quite well under the circumstances. While there were certainly some missteps here (it’s very show-not-tell; several of the central conceits seemed to me to contradict our previously existing canon or just struck me as implausible for this world; there are some very awkward implications about Hermione’s fate without Ron; Ron himself seems a little too broadly comic; I would have loved more trio time and at least a cameo from Neville and Luna), I greatly enjoyed being able to immerse myself in this world again. I really appreciated the choice to spend time revisiting well-traveled story territory and giving it new life and new detail, especially given that the story is in many ways more about the next generation as it was about the original heroes I came to see.

I also thought Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, in addition to exploring the reliable series themes of the vulnerabilities and blindness created by and yet the ultimate power of love, hit on something very real and very natural in focusing on sons struggling with the legacies of their dads and dads struggling with their own pasts in trying to raise their sons. We know how difficult it can be in this world to grow up the child of a famous or infamous father, and it seems like it would be exponentially worse in the world of Wizarding Britain, which is so obsessed with family and bloodlines.

I don’t think I would ever recommend someone start with Cursed Child (and if you’re reading this and haven’t read the series for some reason, fair warning: this is very much written for people who know and love Harry Potter, and please borrow my copy of Sorcerer’s Stone at your leisure), but I think it’s a worthy addition to the series, I’m extremely jealous of anyone who gets to see it play out on stage, and if this exemplifies what J.K. Rowling’s version of Harry’s future is I would love to read more of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

HARRY POTTER and the Cursed Child
Arthur A. Levine / Scholastic
Young Adult / Fantasy

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not a novel. It is a play. The story is by Rowling, and was written by Rowling, Thorne, and Tiffany It is the eight Harry Potter installment, and premiered on a stage in London on July 30, 2016.

This book takes place some 19 years after the Deathly Hallows (Book 7). Albus Potter, the son of Harry and Ginny, is headed to Hogwarts. His biggest fear is the Sorting Hat. He does not want to wind up in Slytherin. Always at odds with his father, Albus knows he will never make it into Gryffindor. It is one more comparison to his father bound to deliver more disappointment.

On the Express to school, Albus befriends a boy sitting alone in one of the cars. Scorpius, like Albus, is plagued by the legend of his father. Although Harry's father was the Wizard of all Wizards--an impossible shadow to crawl out from under, Scorpius' father was the dreadful Draco Malfoy. No one likes him based on this fact alone, and the rumors that Voldemort might actually be his true father. No one, that is, except Albus.

When a Time Turner is recovered, a device allowing for time travel, the tale quickly spins out of control. Amos Diggory (who's son, Cedric Diggory -- the boy murdered in Goblets of Fire by Voldemort) wants Harry to go back in time and save his son; to make it as though the death never happened.

Taking it upon himself to make things right, to maybe impress his own father, Albus and Scorpius, team up with Delphi Diggory (Amos' niece), in an attempt to save Cedric from an untimely death. Their journeys back in time mess up the present. They change the future. Timelines cross.

The damaged caused may be too significant to fix. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco Malfoy are desperate to save Albus, and Scorpius. They fear the return of Voldemort -- and the possible present world where Voldemort isn't just alive, but where he rules the world! Time is of the essence. If the newly revealed prophecy comes to light, the world that they once knew, and loved, would be gone, changed forever!

The play is taut. The Acts, and Scenes perfectly laid out. The story is filled with emotion. It is most definitely a tale about father's and sons. Parents and kids. Depression and hope. Division and reconciliation. The final Scenes brought me to tears. As a fan of the Harry Potter saga, it was amazing to see this story end where Harry Potter's legacy began. Very emotional. I would give anything to see the play. I suppose I will have to hope they make it into a film. I loved placing this finished book on my shelf alongside Rowling's other titles.

At first, the play structure distracted me, but before long I didn't even notice it. I think my only issue with it can't be helped. Because it is a play, it's considerably shorter than a normal Harry Potter book. I think one of the best things about those books is that you can get fully engrossed in the world and stay a while. The Cursed Child is so condensed in comparison. It's still a full story; you're not left hanging. It's just not quite the all-consuming experience that Potter fans are used to. The story line is fun, though.

I expected Harry much more grown-up and I have to say I got when I was looking for on that front. I thought the authors did a relatively good job developing the relationship between Albus and Harry. The friendship between Albus and Scorpius was a bit forced… How many times did they have to say that they were friends. Overall I think the message of the book was that your actions no matter how seemingly small can have a profound impact on your future and the future of those around you. That being said I didn't particularly appreciate all of the resurrections and reprisals of characters that were supposedly left in peace at the end of last original Harry Potter book. I can't help but think that the authors put Harry and Albus in potentially traumatic situations  to draw them closer together. This is unfortunate but it is a particularly useful plot device considering that they were trying to have so much relationship development happen in so little time. Overall this was a great book considering the amount of action that is packed into less than 400 pages.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Yes some of the situations have little development.  Yes they could not quite figure out how to get Ron involved in a satisfying way. Yes this is made for theater.  The best way to enjoy this book is imagining it being played out on stage.  The fact is, it was not made for readers so you are not going to get the same feel you did for the last 7 stories.  Personally, it was very nostalgic to revisit Hogwarts and these characters I loved.

A lot of the reviews on here are pretty telling of that.  I think a lot of fans were expecting typical Harry, Hermoine, and Ron high jinx which you just don't get from this story.  It lacks JK Rowling's magical touch, but that is because she didn't write it.  She came up with a story with these 2 men, and in turn these 2 men turned it into a play.  Play scripts aren't the easiest to read sometimes.  They tend to lack dimension and can have characters coming off a little flat.  For this particular story some of the flatness does come from the writing.  There are moments that could have definitely been better, but I also think some of the lack luster moments are nothing like that while you sit and watch the actors weave their magic into the characters they are portraying.
After all the negative reviews I read I was a little hesitant to start even reading, but half way through I realized it wasn't as awful as some of the more melodramatic reviews are portraying it to be.  Is it the same Harry that we've all grown up with no; but that's just it who is the exact same as they were 19 years ago?  Harry is almost 40 overworked and living a rather mundane life compared to his adolescent years.  The play deals with far more dare I say muggle issues and much less of the wizarding world magic we've all been use to.
This story won't work for everyone who is a lover of this series and I can see why.  For me this story has in no way changed how I feel about the series, as other have felt it has ruined it for them.  If you are on the fence I'd say read it. Definitely go in with an open mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Reading this Harry Potter book feels different, obviously, than the previous seven, as it is written as a play. I liked seeing how much can be done using (almost) only dialogue, and I liked how it felt like slipping right back into the world of characters I—along with the rest of the world—came to know and love so well. I am not, however, a fan of time travel, which was central to this book’s plot so that detracted a bit for me. Still, it’s a fun, must-read book for the Harry Potter world, which let’s face it, along with Frozen, we’re all just living in.

I would love to see the actual play, and can’t imagine how they pull off all that magic on stage!

The first thing to note is that this is a play. It is not a novel, but a play. That's why a lot of die hard fans are upset: they're criticisms include how the plot moves too quickly, how there isn't the classic flavour of Rowling-ian style, and how it seems a bit haphazard. The truth is, they're criticisms are true, but misplaced.

This is a script for a play to be preformed in front of a live audience. It is not a novel. It is a play which has to be preformed within two or three hours, and which has dialogue which can be followed easily (complex style may be fun to read, but if you start trying to decipher what actors are saying you'll start to miss out on the dialogue).

So if you're going to buy it, remember this, it will read like a script. And like all scripts, it will have jumps in between, and the story will move quickly and will be limited by the logistical capabilities of the actual world. I think the analogy to the fanfic is a good one, and I think this is a good fanfic.

To conclude, I'd suggest you try and read some Pottermore from Rowling's website. If you like that sort of thing, you can purchase the book and read it. Or, if you want to truly enjoy it, go watch it in the theatre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Its plot is engaging but light & sentimental the way visiting the theme park must be. It is a script, of course, which means we're missing at least half the storytelling that we would see on the stage.  The Harry Potter universe is a comfortable place to live in again, but I can't imagine one trying to understand it without having read the books;  it seems like all the requisite explanations are there;  again, I think the art is in the stage production.  Although it approaches being derivative, the play almost counts on your expecting what's next to come. This isn't Doctor Who,  though, in which of late all the old villains seem to pop up, for no particular reason, paving over their previous selves.  In fact, my favorite character, without saying too much, is Draco Malfoy. He is wonderfully-rendered to play on and against our expectations. It is almost his story.  Certainly, no one has a better vantage point on the major theme of fathers and sons.  Reading Shakespeare to ourselves, we are always taught to create a theater of the mind. That's what has to happen here to appreciate this story as best as possible in script form. Otherwise, I'm waiting for the promised Broadway run, which will spawn a traveling performance that I'll be waiting at the station to welcome.

P.S. What's with all the hugging & outing of emotions. I'm American & I got squirmy. If Harry had spoken like this about his emotions, A- He would have received progressively harder chucks on the shoulder from Ron, & B- He would have been so emotionally-stable, the idea of running away from everyone & taking on Voldemort single-handedly would have been  impossible, end of story","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This was a fun story, and I was happy to reconnect with some old friends.  (Minor spoilers!) I loved the alternate timelines, but I always love a story with alternate timelines.

It's also a play of a series that's been done and finished for many years now, movies and everything, even if the world itself hasn't quite died with Rowlings great charity books and new Magical Beasts movies.

Still, this story is good. It fits Harry Potter, and is fun to read. There's just under 300 pages of actual story and because it's written as a play there's little to know description for any of the characters or settings as you're expected to know what they look like already, and the read is extremely fast. There's enough twists and turns to make this a great page turner and I'm happy to add it as the 8th story to my Harry Potter shelf.

If I had any complaints, it's that the story definitely feels written by a guy who doesn't really know the world or characters well enough and whose name I'll never see anywhere but on this book. A lot of the story uses repeated events to get itself going rather than inventing anything new, and sticks with replaying events already written by the master JK Rowling. As a result it is a rehashing story, but it's done well enough that I'll excuse most of it to call it a great play-book. The ending is also completely tied in an extremely tight package that one would expect from any ""they lived happily ever after"" story, rather than the world-changing events that happened at the end of the 7th book. While this isn't a problem for fantasy tales, I still feel it would have been better had something meaningful been added at the end instead of the two heroes looking out over the sunset. Then again, it isn't my story, and my expectations are always going to be greater than what's delivered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Hopkins","Time","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2016","The eighth book in the Harry Potter series titled, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts I & II, is the script of a play set two decades after the last novel. Harry’s son, Albus, is at Hogwarts, and the play delves into the theme of parents and children, while using the structure of time to move the action. I liked it well enough for what it is: something different in form, structure and time period. I didn’t hate it much for what it isn’t: a big sprawling novel that absorbs one’s total attention like the earlier installments, a book I might have enjoyed more than this one.

1. It's a script for a play.  Its cearly not even the working script because there is no stage direction as all.  just a blip here and there about where they are.  It's all dialog.

2. the plot is written like a 90s reunion episode for your favorite 80's sitcom family.  They went out of their way to have people that shouldn't be in the HP universe 20 years in future pop in for a cameo. The Dialog is MUCH better than what you find in those tv events.

Doenges","If you're old Harry Potter reader with a good memory of all the wonderful settings","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2016","If you've never read Harry Potter, then this isn't the place to start.  It depends not only upon the general premise or some characters from the previous series, but also upon some very specific past plot sequences.  Indeed the plot of this book is very clever, hence the four stars.  If you don't already have a sense of setting and characters, you will not find enough here.  If you are Jonesing for the next Harry Potter book, again I'd say stop. This is not the next book; it's the next story.  Big difference.  As this is a play script, there is virtually no setting.  Unlike reading a novel with its rich descriptions of things and moods and circumstances, this is a play written sparingly.  The clever story hangs upon dialog and some simple stage directions.

If you're old Harry Potter reader with a good memory of all the wonderful settings, that you can call to mind as the play unfolds, and if you know the characters well enough to pick up with them much later, then you love this.  The new characters in the form of children are a wonderful addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In it, Harry and his youngest son, Albus, have a difficult relationship.  The legacy of ""Harry Potter"" doesn't sit well on Albus's young shoulders; he feels exceptionally different from his father, and even perceives that Harry doesn't love him.

Albus and his best friend find themselves in an adventure that ultimately shows Albus's brave spirit and caring heart, yet nearly destroys the hard won peace of the wizarding world.

Many of the beloved characters from the Harry Potter past are in the Cursed Child in some form or another, from the Golden Trio to the Trolley Witch.  Some familiar scenes were revisited, which was poignant.  An iconic scene was recreated under slightly different circumstances; I'm convinced it was done just to make the fans blubber--and I'm not ashamed to say that I did.  The new plot itself is fun, serious, exciting--just like the original stories.

My difficulties with the Cursed Child were few, but definite.  I think that one of the adult characters had changed more than was believable.  I think that one of the child characters was a little too good to be true.  As for the mystery/secret/whatever it should be called, it was entirely too easy to figure out very early on in the plot.  Also, some of the scenes felt forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to wring out emotion.  For these reasons, I have to say that I ""liked"" rather than ""loved"" it.

Overall, the Cursed Child--while flawed--is a pleasant, nostalgic trip back to the Potterverse, and introduces new and endearing characters to the fans","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Before I start this review, I want you to know that J.K. Rowling did NOT write this book, Jack Thorne did. This is written like a play, not a novel, so don't be surprised.

This takes place Nineteen years after The Battle of Hogwarts that took place in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling. All the characters are grown and they have kids themselves. Harry is married to Ginny and Ron to Hermione. Harry and Ginny have two sons, James Sirius and Albus Severus and a daughter, Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione have two kids, Rose and Hugo. Professor McGonagall is the Headmistress of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is over the Ministry of Magic and Harry Potter is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

I will not give a full synopsis but I will give some spoilers.

The beginning is a little jumpy. It starts with Albus' and Rose's first year at Hogwarts. It then goes to their third year. It then goes to the next summer when a criminal by the name of Theodore Nott makes a time-turner and Harry potter receives it. (All the time-turners were destroyed after the Battle of Hogwarts.)

Scorpius' mother then passes away and then a year later Amos Diggory shows up at Harry's house, knowing that there is a time-turner that exists, asking to bring his son back. Harry refuses and with Amos is a woman by the name of Delphi, who is the niece of Amos.

Delphi manages to tell Albus and Scorpius about the time-turner and gets them to steal it from Hermione's office. They then use it to stop Cedric from winning the Triwizard Tournament.With this, they change the timelines.

Later after all of this, they find out that Voldemort has a daughter with Bellatrix Lestrange and Harry and Ron have to save them. Delphi turns out to be Delphini, Voldemort's daughter. Her goal was to stop her father from trying to kill Harry Potter because it made him weak.

END OF SPOILERS

Overall, I thought this book was ok. It wasn't as bad as a lot of people said it was, but I enjoyed it. I wish that there was more about the older characters themselves as well.

This work is written in such a style to facilitate live performances. As such, it seems unfair to compare the extent to which characters are developed and the overall plot complexity to J.K. Rowling's original series. The original seven were not bound by the added task of producing a narrative which can easily be digested in a spoken format (in addition to proving itself worthy of the original series as a standalone literary text).

With that said, I found the latest installment of the Harry Potter series to be an enjoyable read in the sense that it allowed me to revisit old friends made many years ago (even if only for an afternoon). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reignited that childlike imaginative spark in me, which is the reason I fell in love with the world of Hogwarts in the first place. Without going into too much detail, the play focuses on the difficulty Harry and Ginny's son, Albus Severus, has with being the underperforming child of the ""the boy who lived"". Albus struggles with living up to the reputation of the Potter name, and subsequently becomes a bit of a loner who does not hold the same esteem for Hogwarts as his parents would have hoped. The piece also speaks to the difficulty Harry has parenting a somewhat rebellious Albus, who is often viewed by others to be ""different"". When Albus befriends the child of a certain former Slytherin house member with whom Harry shared several altercations with during his time at Hogwarts, Harry is tasked with determining whether he should intervene to keep Albus out of trouble, or rather to put his preconceived notions of Malfoy's only son aside and allow Albus to continue to spend time with his one true friend. In addition, Harry must also make Albus understand the difference between seeking out trouble versus confronting it when it presents itself to you -- a lesson Albus eventually learns throughout the course of the play.

If you're a fan of the original series, it's my recommendation you give this piece a try. It is a fast read, and an interesting spin on the original storyline - -  one in which a second generation of Potters, Weasley-Grangers, and Malfoys tantalize their parents and Hogwarts faculty members; a skill their parents mastered only 19 years prior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Did I like it? Yes. Yes, I did.

Now, this did not have the same magical feel as it would have had had it been written as a complete story and not just a play script. It's primarily dialogue. But I love dialogue, so that worked well for me. But descriptions, scene-building, etc, are mostly lost. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has never read Harry Potter before, as there are a lot of assumptions made about what the reader should already know. I've read other plays where there is much more description, so comparatively I cannot give this 5 stars because I think they could have done more.

But what they did include - the plot, the character interactions - was quite profound. I don't want to give away spoilers about the main conflict of the story, but the questions that arise were really thoughtful. I imagine fans of the series may have had these same questions after reading the series. So I love how the big plot point was adddressed. It makes the characters think, but makes the reader think as well. I thought it was a really fascinating twist on the HP world at large.

Of course, what really touched me were the characters. This was really a multi-generational story. We get our middle aged favorites, as well as their children. I loved wrapping myself up in all my love for these characters, old and new. The thought that went into Harry's relationship with his son, Albus, was very touching. I really liked how the father/son relationship was explored in all its complexities and I was really moved by it. I also loved the friendship between Albus and Scorpius. I loved seeing them as individuals, who they were in regards to their famous/notorious fathers raising of them, how they came into their own at Hogwarts, and who they became as they sought out such an unlikely but absolutely necessary friendship with the other. They were the sweetest besties. Even the healing of other older relationships was quite touching. And, of course, there was a cameo or two that tested my tear ducts and gave my heart lots of feels.

Overall, I really enjoyed this extra glimpse into the Harry Potter world. I simply love these characters. I would have loved an actual novel instead of a play, but regardless, I loved the overall story (and would love to see the play live).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But really","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, J. K Rowling, Jack Thorne, & John Tiffany.
“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a play based on a story by J. K. Rowling, but written by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany for the stage. Set in the present, Harry, now a father of three is struggling with his relationship to his youngest son, Albus Serverus. Harry, it turns out, is not quite the perfect parent. But really, who is? Albus, in my view is a pretty typical teenager, unhappy and embarrassed by his famous father. In a misguided attempt to win his father’s approval, Albus and his best bud Scorpius Malfoy get themselves in a real pickle. As always, friendship is at the heart of any Harry Potter story, and I loved that the friendship between Albus and Scorpius was a strong factor in the plot. Scorpius is a delight and has some great scene-stealing lines. I don’t view this play as Harry Potter #8. It’s really just a short story that’s been turned into a play. I know there is a lot of outrage by some fans, who feel this work falls short of Rowling’s best, but I quite enjoyed the play; how could I not? It allowed me the opportunity to visit Hogwarts and all my favorite characters again.
Highly recommended for Potter fans everywhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_170?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=170&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The play starts with the last scen of Deathly Hallows, and through the magic of time travel revisits the events of Goblet of Fire.  Key elements of the story are the relationships between Harry and his son Albus, and Albus and Scorpio Malfoy.  The ongoing theme is how small changes in the past can mean large differences in the present.  As an adult who has read a lot of science fiction, I pretty much figured everything out halfway through the play.

I never thought that would happen again and for that I am grateful. Overall, I'm glad I read the screenplay. I had heard many not-so-good reviews of the book and decided to go into it as blindly as possible. I was able to avoid any spoilers and was very aware that this was a screenplay and not a book and that it wouldn't be the same as a Harry Potter book, and that helped me to enjoy it more and just take it for what it is: another new Harry Potter experience.

HP8 is not perfect. The writing is often quite flat and SO FAR from J.K. Rowling's voice that at times the characters don't even feel like themselves (I'm looking at you, Ron...). It is largely plot and action based, and I'm sure the actors would bring so much more life into the script when performed, but to read it certainly felt unauthentic at times.

Where the old characters fall a bit flat, the new ones shine. Albus and Scorpius have an enviable friendship. It was interesting to see the children of two arch-enemies become best friends, completely disregarding their fathers' opinions of the other family. It was also interesting to see Hogwarts through the eyes of an unpopular boy who wasn't particularly good at magic or Quidditch. Albus' experience at school was the complete opposite of Harry's and, in my opinion, made Hogwarts feel a little bit more realistic.

I loved the theme of family in this book. It was so satisfying to see our trio happy with families of their own and jobs that were actually perfect for them. Regardless of how I felt about the actual choice of storyline, the writing style, or anything else, I still loved the book because it was another chance to be immersed in the wizarding world without knowing what happens next, and that is a rare thing that I haven't had the privilege of experiencing for many years.

Harry Potter is and always will be my first true love when it comes to books. The original Harry Potter books inspired and engrossed me like nothing has since, and have proved themselves to endure as phenomenal works for nearly my whole life.

I remember being six or seven years old and my mom purchased Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to read aloud to me at night before bed. As they came out, I checked out the next books at the library and devoured them. I became obsessed with the series -- I had SO MUCH HP merch back in the day. Shirts, a backpack, decorations for my room, a clock, video games, literally everything. I had my mom pre-order the new books for me and waited at the front door for UPS to show up. I attended midnight releases of the books and movies as I got older. I literally grew up alongside Harry Potter and I am so grateful for those wonderful experiences, and I will continue to be grateful for any little extension of that world that I might get.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK, I RECOMMEND STOPPING HERE.

It was absolutely heartbreaking to read about Albus' trials during the first part of the book. I felt so sad for him to feel so lonely and useless at Hogwarts. I hated that he felt like a disappointment to Harry for being sorted into Slytherin. I wanted to help Albus and Harry to connect with each other and for Harry to be able to help Albus with his demons.

I was terrified during the portion of the time travel when Albus and Scorpius discover the alternate reality where Voldemort is ruler. I had never considered that alternative -- that Voldemort was victorious during the Battle of Hogwarts, that he killed Harry and prevailed to lead the wizarding world into darkness. I'm glad it was a short piece of the book because it was so horrible, but it was interesting to consider and also put into perspective a bit more that weight of Harry's greatness that Albus felt he had to live up to.

The back and forth time travel got a bit tiresome at times, but I did not see the twist with Delphi coming AT ALL. I love when I can be surprised by a twist or turn in a book and certainly was here, although thinking about Voldemort's and Bellatrix's daughter is pretty disgusting. It's very interesting that J.K. Rowling decided to make that canon.

One last thing -- THANK YOU to J.K. Rowling for making Hermione Minister of Magic! I could not believe what I had read when that was revealed and was SO PROUD of my frizzy-haired girl for coming so far. Hermione was the first character I remember ever truly LOVING and identifying with and it was so wonderful to see her turn out to be everything she deserved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_173?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=173&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I've just finished it. Here's a quick review without spoiler.

Well, a bit of spoiler that wouldn't hurt your pleasure of reading. Albus Severus Potter was (checked below for spoiler) And Albus & Scorpius (Malfoy) are main characters. And there is one new character we would have never thought of otherwise.

Before you start reading, remember it is script for a play, not your usual novel. So, if you have never read a play, that'd be a bit odd. It goes by scene with dialogues and description of the actions of characters. I'm not sure about you but I wish I could watch the play, too! It'd be a magnificient one, I reckon.

It is so good that you could read a lot about many old characters with a balanced blend of new ones. As we potterheads are so attached to Harry, there are countless heartwrenching moments to witness the scenes between Harry and Albus.

Albus is, compareing to Harry Potter, ... I think I better not write this.

There are a lot of jaw-dropping moments, like double or triple twists, but as we all know good things win at the end (with some sacrifices) in the stories like Harry Potter, the feeling that this wouldn't end up this way always distracted me from feeling the scary or sad moments. This is, if anything, the only bad side about this book.

The book is fairly short, only like 2-hour read. I wish there were more scenes about the eldest son or the youngest daughter.

The ending, I meant the last words on the last page, is sort of cliche for a play. But the general ending of the plot after climax looks pretty HarryPotter-ish. As it is a Harry Potter book, SPOILER, (check below for spoiler)

Giving that the last book was published in 2007 the last movie was released in 2011, this is quite a uplifting retouch to our memories with characters we admire.

I've just learnt many hated this book. Again, this is script not novel. And yes, I totally agree that this is not as good as other books but how can you resist not to read this after 9 years of missing them?

Go read it and enjoy!

Johns","This is good as long you are clear what you're getting","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2016","There seems to be some confusion from certain buyers of this ""book"" about what they are getting and comparing it to the original seven works of the Harry Potter heptalogy. This is a bound script book. It's literally the script to a stage play of a new story set in the HP universe. As such, it is almost all dialogue with very little of the detailed exposition that so many of us loved in the original series.

Keeping in mind that this is merely a script, I give the work 4 stars. Would I have loved to have seen it fleshed out into a proper eighth book - of course I would have. So would almost everyone who has read it, but it is what it is and as an HP fan I'm glad that the story has continued with the main three characters set 22 years in the future.

Without giving away too many spoilers, the story mostly revolves around the sons of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy and their daddy issues that get them into lots of trouble. Of the two, I found that Draco's son, Scorpius, was easily the most entertaining and distinct character but Albus Potter was also well defined.

As far as the adults, Hermione is very Hermione-like and Ron is exactly what you'd expect a middle-aged Ron to be like. The one character that just didn't ring very authentic to me was adult Harry. There was just something off about his depiction and his relationship with his son Albus that didn't ring true to me.

It's a quick read being that it's a 300 page script book so be prepared for that. And maybe I had lower expectations knowing that this wasn't a ""real"" book, but I still think it's a very welcome addition to any Potter fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_159?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=159&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As a director of theatrical productions I could picture the story as it took place on the stage in my mind.  Of course I had images of the original actors and their voices as I read it, but I thought it was conceptually a real achievement.
It has to be nearly impossible to take something so well loved by readers and attempt a new piece of art with it.  The only way to enjoy this is to allow that part of you that loves Harry Potter and allow your imagination and your love of the characters take you on another exciting ride.  Yes, some of the dialogue is a bit shaky and you can tell it wasn't written by J.K., but it's still pretty amazing.  I loved the whole father-son dynamic. It just flowed right from the ending of the original series.
My only regret is that I am not going to see the play tonight!  I want to know how they make all this wonderful magic happen on the stage.  Plays are not really meant to be read, but to be witnessed.  It may have been a mistake to release the play to the masses so quickly. Perhaps it would have been a smoother move to let the play speak for itself until word of mouth demanded a need for the public to read the script.

Despite the bodies, the bloodshed, the betrayals and broken bonds of brotherhood, all was well.

Well, perhaps not.

Opening onto a familiar scene—Harry Potter wishing his youngest son, Albus Severus Potter, a good first year at Hogwarts regardless of what house he is sorted into—this screenplay quickly sets the tone for how the rest of its story will proceed. In a whirlwind of snippets showing Albus’s first few years at Hogwarts in Pensieve-like rapid succession, we’re brought up to speed that Albus—indeed sorted into Slytherin House—is having a rough go of it at Hogwarts. He feels like a disappointment to his father, a stain upon the family legacy. He’s bold and decisive, and clever to boot, but isn’t blessed with the same abundance of friends or popularity Harry enjoyed/endured during his time at Hogwarts. To quote another popular play, he’s got a lot of brains but no polish.

And when the opportunity arises for Albus to redeem himself by rectifying one of his father’s greatest past mistakes, he jumps at it with all the reckless abandon a teenaged boy can muster.

From there, the script—and do not mistake this as a book, because it’s not, but rather a script for a play production, complete with stage directions—goes along at a pleasant clip, never slowing down longer than is necessary to introduce a new face or show off a new spell, of which there are a few.

You’ll feel familiar with the past characters, though as some other reviews have pointed out, it can sometimes feel more like fanfiction than a legitimate canon installment in the Harry Potter universe. Maybe it’s the subject of the story itself, but in many ways it falls short of feeling true.

The tone of the story, as well, lacks the same oomph seen at least in the later books in the Original Seven. The best I can describe it is: Imagine if Eoin Colfer had been commissioned to write a new Harry Potter novel. It’s for kids. It’s fun and fast and exciting at almost every single turn. Personally, I love Eoin Colfer’s books. He’s a genius for children’s literature. But when I step into a true addition to the Harry Potter canon, I want meat to the story, gravitas to the plot, and a huge amount of emotional commitment to the characters. And while I enjoyed what I read, it didn’t leave me with the sensation that I could read a whole series about the progeny of our original wizards and witches.

Ultimately, I very much enjoyed it for what it was. I laughed, I bounced my knees excitedly, and darn it all, I was almost moved to sniffles at one point near the end. The lightheartedness of The Tales of Beedle the Bard shine through here more than anything else, and if you’re looking for a sometimes tense but mostly joyful and refreshing romp with some childhood magic, you’ll enjoy spending a few hours reading this story as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Based on the reviews, I wasn't sure if buying the book was a great idea, but I enjoyed it. A few words of advice for fellow readers:

-The play format sucks. There's no getting around it. There's notes in italics on what the characters are doing, what scenery is changing, etc. Not ideal, but still readable.

-It gets a little corny. Go into it with a sense of humor, and also remembering that Harry was a bit bitter by the end of the 7th book. Relieved, yes, but still somewhat bitter.

*****SPOILER ALERT *******
-His son is in Slytherin. Happens in the first, oh, 15 pages, but that adds to the divide in the rest of the book and all of the teenage thinking that follows.

I honestly think it would be fantastic if not for the play format. But if you remember how all of the characters were and how they acted in the previous books, it's really not hard for your imagination to fill in the blanks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I’m typically not a fan of “extras” after a series has ended. I usually regard these additions as optional canon because I feel most of the time it’s better for an author to leave well enough alone. So I approached Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in a different way, not as canon, but as a neat little “extra” that at the end of the day, I don’t necessarily have to consider a part of the Harry Potter universe. From the get-go, the play interfered with the headcanons I’ve created since the series ended. I’ve created futures for these characters and how their relationships have evolved and had a knee-jerk reaction to a particularly salty interaction between two characters at the beginning of the play. It was from this moment forward that I knew I wasn’t going to call this canon Harry Potter, but instead of focusing on the various aspects of the novel I couldn’t quite reconcile with my own thoughts on the HP world, I sat back and enjoyed the ride.

The focus of this play is Harry’s tumultuous relationship with his youngest son Albus. Uncomfortable with the extra attention that comes with being Harry Potter’s son, Albus feels like he’s destined to be a disappointment. He struggles with his identity throughout the story and because his father’s shadow looms large, it’s difficult for him to discover who he is apart from the legacy of his father. While I sympathized with Albus’ inner struggles, it was hard to find him entirely likable as he tended to indulge in self-pity at the detriment of other people’s own struggles. Harry finds it difficult to connect with Albus, who doesn’t seem to want anything to do with the famous Harry Potter, and this is where their relationship gets off track. It’s become almost impossible for Albus to separate how everyone perceives his father from who Harry actually is and Harry can’t understand the loneliness and social shunning Albus has endured at Hogwarts when his own view of the school is seen through a lens of idyllic nostalgia.

Of the secondary characters we are first introduced to, no one shines quite as bright as Scorpius Malfoy. This kid is what I hoped for when I imagined the new generation. He brings a lightness to the narrative despite the negativity surrounding him and his family’s connection to Voldemort. Scorpius knows how other people view him, but unlike Albus who seems to bruise under the weight of his ancestry, Scorpius remains defiant in a different sort of way. He is kind and loyal, willing to go to great lengths to protect the people he loves. Though many are determined to dislike him, Scorpius remains good-natured, confident that if given the chance, those with prejudice views will eventually see him for who he is and not what the imagine him to be.

Overall, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was actually quite an entertaining read. I’m interested in the extra tidbits the play provides in terms of special effects, but even without it this story provided plenty of enjoyable moments and just the right amount of nostalgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Nothing really majorly mad, if you're a Potter fan, you'll enjoy this. I like how the characters have progressed and I like how none of them are perfect. They all have flaws and a major part of this is that Harry has flaws. I really enjoyed this. Only complaint is that it was in script form.

Who wouldn't after what he went through?!

Having grown up with these books and having read all the books more than once I look forward to sharing these books with my son when he is old enough to read. I was cautious to dive into this new story and finally I gave in and picked up a copy of this play. I can say its not my favorite story of all the books. However I enjoyed it and was glad to see the characters in their grown up form and working through life (work and raising the kids). I for one believe the characters kept their integrity. The characters did not change work for their families as evident by the struggle to raise the kids while exposed to the adult world of responsibility. The new main characters the children of the protagonist from the original books are a welcome addition to the story and like all the other books there is a moral to the story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_164?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=164&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter has a huge following and many people from my generation (myself included) grew up with Harry. These books are hands down the reason I learned to love reading. There’s also a few things you should know about this installment, if you don’t already: its written as a script and while the story is from J.K. Rowling, it still had to be translated to a play form so we don’t get a lot of the descriptions and detail we are used to in the books. There were absolutely phrases I recognized and I was so appreciative of that. I’m not saying this is necessarily a disappointment, and I know it was necessary to adapt the story to a script. Still, I missed it.

That being said, did I enjoy the story? Yes, I did. I honestly did not have any expectations, because how could you when the story is told in such a different format? In a way, I think Rowling is smart to do it this way. If she had simply written another book, would I have been disappointed if it didn’t live up to the first seven? Probably. Most likely. But with a play..its new and original. Its a standalone, in a way, and I can appreciate it for what it is.

As for the story line, there were many aspects that were really heartwarming. There were elements from past books, and scenes with characters I never imagined I would see again. There are relationships I was happy to watch develop. I don’t want to say too much about the plot though. The story mainly follows Albus Severus Potter and his adventure. There’s not as much time spent at Hogwarts, not as much magic and spells, yet I still enjoyed it. It is not, by any means, a continuation of the series. It is a standalone play, but we do get to revisit our beloved characters one last time. There was so much nostalgia with this story!

The dialogue is also hilarious. Ron is still as goofy as ever, and Hermione is equally bossy.

“Ron: Honestly, every time I sit down I make an “ooof” noise. An “ooof.” And my feet- thr trouble I’m having with my feet- I could write songs about the pin my feet give me- maybe your scar is like that.”

Page 67

Harry is still same old Harry, and I was very pleased with his relationship with Ginny.

“Harry: I’d do anything for him.

Ginny: You’d do anything for anybody. You were pretty happy to sacrifice yourself for the world.”

Page 277

Oh and Scorpius was darling! I loved his character. His relationship with Albus made me nostalgic for the Ron, Hermione, Harry days.

I also really did love all of the references to Harry’s adventures from his childhood. I experienced some major Harry Potter nostalgia going through this play. The ending was also very poetic, in a way we ended where everything began. Overall, I was pleased with this Harry Potter story. It was a lovely tribute to our favorite characters, and we even learned a little more about some of them. My only regret is that I can’t see it on stage! Maybe one day :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Only thing I really didn't like about this book was that it sped through parts of his child's life that I would have like to read a little more into.

I agree with many other HP book fans that this play is more of a standalone entity than a continuation of the series.

It was the characters that we know, love, and grew up with-many of us. Along with new ones.  It was really awesome to go back to Hogworts with the younger, newer generation. The effects were(reading about them) were crazy! They set good scenes for the plot and they really built the action and tension and the stressfulness of the plot well!

I feel that this book is getting a lot of bad press because people are thinking, ""oh, it's a Harry Potter book written by JK Rowling!"" No, it's a PLAY ADAPTATION of the original story, that she came up with that was read a approved by her! Its says so right on the cover people! I mean come on, I know that going into it that it was a PLAY SCRIPT! I hate to break the news to you, but it reads like one too!
Regardless of that, the band of characters were great, and it was really enjoyable, and if you understand that it's, a script to a play that was approved by Rowling, you will really like reading it.

While I don't mind the script for the play, I am finding myself missing the magic of J.K.'s beautiful details. That woman just has a way with creating worlds, and characters that we have fallen in love with in each book.
But listen, we all went to Hogwarts for year after year, we know what it looks like in our imaginations. Dare I say we saw the movies and if your imagination is failing you there's always that to fall back on.
I am 2/3rds done with the book, and I am loving meeting the children of our beloved characters. Seeing who they turned into, what qualities were passed down from their parents.

This is an easy quick read, and a solid story on which to base a theatre production. I only wish I could travel to London to see it all done up on stage.

So tend to your broken hearts Potter fans, because at the end of the day, we got what we wanted... More Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_184?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=184&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Albus, nervous about which house he’s going to be sorted in, makes some friends on the train to Hogwarts and learns about what happens when he’s put under the spotlight purely because he’s the son of the most famous man in the wizarding world.

As Albus and his close friends become more learned, they also become warier about the world they live in, thinking some aspects of it are unfair. They don’t trust the adults in their lives with how they are really feeling and thinking they can only rely on themselves. This, of course, gets them into a lot of trouble. But dark forces are gathering out on the fringes of civilized society and the Ministry of Magic is trying to figure out what’s going on. But will Harry and his friends be able to figure it out it before it’s too late and the lives of those they love are put at risk?

This story fits seamlessly into the Potter canon, as there are plenty of references to the previous novels. These references are very specific in this story, as they point to all different aspects of Harry's lifetime. The events depicted here don't contradict any of what has been previously established but they do add on to the canon in creative and unexpected ways. And the final scenes were very clever, suspenseful and well done, bringing the story full circle.

The middle of the story veers into science fiction territory here but I feel it is used well as a device to explore alternate points of view and the paths not taken had another choice been made. It’s presented in an exciting way that was riveting and kept me glued to my seat. It also has lasting repercussions going forward for the entire world. And the impact it has on those who participate in these events eventually do learn from the experience and apply it as they progress further into the story so I definitely can appreciate the consistency of character development that happens along the way.

There seems to be a soap opera element in terms of the main antagonist. I won't say anything more about that individual and their nefarious plan, other than that their origins feel very fan fiction to me. However, the presentation of that origin, how it was explained and the scenes in which it was revealed were quite mesmerizing, used for complete and maximum emotional impact. As a counterpoint, those final scenes were also quite agonizing, the most powerful and the most captivating. I challenge any Harry Potter fan to not feel something in the climax of this story. Harry in particular states something that rings so true, so plays to the theme of the story and encapsulates all of the Harry Potter stories to date so well that its resonance is very poetic. And the epilogue cements these themes home in a very poignant and appropriate way.

Resonance is the key word here, as it mostly rings true throughout the whole book. It successfully captures the embodiment of these beloved stories for the most part, with some minor missteps along the way.

I really liked the characterization of the children. Albus Severus can never seem to escape his father’s shadow no matter how hard he tries and their relationship is one of the strong spines of the story. Albus is awkward, emotional about himself and is as impulsive as any normal 14-year-old. He feels like a loser and a failure, especially in comparison to his famous father. While naturally, Scorpius Malfoy also considers himself a loser but finds solace in his friendship with Albus. His enthusiasm and embracing of his nerd-like tendencies provide some comic relief and a stark contrast to the darker aspects of the plot. Together, they are losers banding together to not feel lonely and try to achieve success in their ambitious endeavors, finding inspiration and strength in each other. Their camaraderie together is one of the true highlights of this book.

I do wish we spent more time with Rose Weasley-Granger as she was a scene stealer when we got to see her and very much the embodiment of her parents.

At times, it does feel like ""Harry Potter's Greatest Hits"" in terms of how the story plays out but instead of just revisiting them, it uses them to add a different and refreshing take on a scene or event. In that way, it feels good to revisit Harry's old haunts and familiar characters, like spending time with old friends after not seeing them for a long while. These scenes play an important part in the story and are used as a crucible that tests all the characters who endure them. As a play being performed, these moments must be true crowd-pleasers and hit the right emotional notes. Rave reviews of the play’s performance seem to bear this out, with plenty of cheers and applause being reported.

As a script, the dialogue should be read like this was a radio play. It uses words to express its performance, being expositional in nature and helping to paint a picture for the reader in their mind's eye. However, sometimes it can be so descriptive that the dialogue feels clunky like this line of Draco’s dialogue: “I'm not one for small talk...""

Malfoy has changed over the years but to talk about himself like that seems out of place. But when you consider the context of the script, the purpose of the dialogue is to explain something being performed on a stage versus being read as a conversation in a novel. So, to me, it acts as a shorthand for the reader/audience member, even if it doesn’t always sound completely natural.

The dialogue is mostly spot on for me at times and feels like the characters we know and love. But there are some places where it feels a little out of character. I don’t think Harry would ever say a particularly hurtful line to Albus like he does here, given his time with the Dursleys. But it does encapsulate his frustration with their relationship, especially as Harry astutely states that he grew up without ever having a loving father and how it can be difficult for him to be in this role.

Also, some pieces of the action feel out of character as well. For example, when Draco and Harry have a confrontation, the outcome of it seems off, especially given the vocation of one of those characters, supposedly at the top of his professional game.

I like the way it expanded on the Potter lore with some of the new characters while existing characters are given a larger role to play here. I also welcome the elements of the next generation of Harry Potter being utilized here and have a large part to play. Thankfully, the characters we all know and love from the books have plenty of things to do here. Combined, it makes for a great cast of characters to involve ourselves in throughout the story. Those we don’t get to see are name-dropped here and there, fleshing out the story and adding that familiarity to it.

There was one scene that was particularly ingenious and delightful, shining through like light through the dark, evil cloud that hangs over the story. This scene revolves around a particular object that plays a very important role. The way it is hidden and how others try to find the clues to solve this particular puzzle all felt very authentic and in line with the character who hides it.

Finally, the title of each Harry Potter book is very important, as it reveals an important object(s), character or group in each story that is central to the plot, adding a sense of curiosity and intrigue. By the end of each story, that importance is clearly revealed. This book is no different in its title, as prior to this book's release, we wonder who the Cursed Child is. Well, in this case, it’s not spelled out explicitly who the titular child is, though there are a couple of candidates who certainly fit this description. Whether this vagueness is intentional or the reader is meant to decide for themselves, I don’t know.

So, you’ve just read an adult’s opinion of this book. Considering that Harry Potter was written for children but equally enjoyed by adults, maybe you’re wondering what a child thinks of this book? Wonder no more, because I know what you REALLY want to know is what my eleven-year-old son thinks of the story. Here is his review, written by him:

I thought it was amazing. I liked all the action and it was really page-turning.

I thought the book was pretty interesting, coming out with showing who’s getting which house with the Sorting Hat and it gets me thinking that I want to finish the book because I want to see what happens next.

It was also interesting to see how the kids from the original books grew up, what jobs they had and how they did them. Seeing Harry with his son Albus, it was like they were almost opposite personalities. I thought it was special how their relationship changed over the course of the book.

I liked the antagonist’s evil scheme because it kept me reading. I thought they hid their identity very secretly and how they did so was amazing. I was real surprised when I found out who the antagonist was and then I wanted to keep reading it more.

Albus was really daring, along with Scorpius. He was smart and he followed what Albus did almost. Their friendship was good from the beginning. It was a really quick thing about how they wanted to be friends. It was like from the original books, as they were daring like their parents. It was brave for Albus and Scorpius of them that they wanted to use something that was illegal to bring someone back who had already died in the books.

That final scene was pretty epic, like in the final scenes in the other books, like in the first one with Harry against Professor Quirrell, in the fourth one where they were in the graveyard with Lord Voldemort and the fifth when they were battling in the Ministry of Magic. They all have big end scenes.

I didn’t like it when they didn’t tell about the first couple of years, they just went first year on the train, second year on the train and third and fourth.

I didn’t like that because they didn’t explain what they did in those years. There’s always a lot going on in those years.

I liked the ending scene the most because it was the final confrontation when they were all going to fight the antagonist.  It was very action-packed.

As a Harry Potter fan, I came away from this book feeling mostly satisfied with this new addition to the canon. It is as advertised, the “Special Rehearsal Edition”. This means it is only the script they used while rehearsing the play for the month prior to its official premiere. In the rehearsals being done from July 1st through July 29th, 2016, there was undoubtedly some fine tuning done, tweaking dialogue and refining the script better in preparation for its official premiere on July 30th. At that point, the script is locked in and considered complete.

As a result of this being a script book, each page is filled with dialogue along with some notes setting the scene, description of emotions on display and some directions telling you where the actors are placed on the stage. Your imagination has to do a lot of the heavy lifting and fill in the gaps in absence of watching this being performed on a stage filled with scenery. The plot does move very briskly because of the script format and it's a very quick read as a result. But it also is a quick read because there's a lot of white space on each page as a result of the script format of the book, with lots of spaces between lines. Both I and my son finished this book in a small amount of time.

However, if you only had to buy one edition of this book, I would wait for the Definitive Edition due to go on sale in early 2017. When that book comes out, this rehearsal edition will be phased out of bookstores and eventually be replaced with this one. The Definitive Edition will reportedly have some extra content from the play's creative team. Though I’m sure true fans will be buying both editions.

Once I read the Definitive Edition, I will be curious to see what has changed and what improvements have been made. In that sense, this book is essentially an unfinished and incomplete product, albeit one that is closer to completion than not. It’s a couple of drafts away from being one hundred percent complete, in my opinion.

Let’s face it, all true Harry Potter fans will be reading this book. But when you do, make sure your expectations are kept in check, as this is NOT a novel, it’s just a script book. It’s a stage play adapted into a book format, one medium adapted into another. Therefore, it's a different experience from reading one of her novels. It mostly captures the magic, feel, and tone of her stories but the script aspect of it is somewhat limiting at times.

It is also a new full-length Harry Potter tale with a new story by JK Rowling, something we haven’t had in over nine years. So, I do think you should read this book, as it’s an entertaining story filled with characters we’ve come to love, new characters to care about and a fast-moving plot that whisks you away to a land of magic once again.

Two Harry Potter fans, an adult, and a child, reviewed this, two different generations and two different perspectives. We agree on many things here and overall, we both enjoyed it very much. Bring on the Definitive Edition, as both my son and I can’t wait to read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In the fifth grade my grandparents brought me back the original three novels from England and I was over the moon!! I grew up into my twenties waiting patiently for each installment to come. I still remember working my first job at Walmart on overnights and taking my break at midnight to pick up Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, going home and not even sleeping for 24 hours to finish. I've read each book about five times, some of them more than that.
I must also admit I'm a bit of a snob, I only just watched the first few movies recently because my seven year old wanted to after reading the illustrated version of the book. So when I saw this was coming out and that it was a play and not a real novel I decided I didn't want to pick it up. Well that lasted til noon on release day before seeing so many people reading it that I had to drop what I was doing, pack up the kids, and drive to two stores to get it. I sat down during nap time and read the whole thing in one sitting.
I am not a play reader, I never have been. Even being good in school I never finished the great works of Shakespeare or read any classics, they just aren't my style. Now to anyone afraid of reading this because its a play, don't be. I read it just fine and it sort of melded into a regular book for me after the first few scenes.
I originally was going to give it three stars, but rounded up to four because the story was really quite good and it was good to see old favorites back like Snape. RIP :(
I really liked the emotional parts of the story and the troublesome relationship between Harry and his son Albus. I love Harry, but always thought he was shown to be too perfect and I loved when he had some internal conflict and acted out of character. I also really liked the friendship between Albus and Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius. They truly had a deep connection.
The last two acts were a bit much for me. We had a watered down Voldemort comes back plot which was both too much and not enough. The writers could have went two ways: not done it at all and just focused on the relationship aspect of the story or they could have added a hundred pages and made it a full fledged plot. I get that this is a real play, but I'm sure that no one would complain of it being too long to watch in person!
Like other reviewers have said hopefully this is the end. I gave it a chance and liked it but unless there is a spin off series such as her American Hogwards I'm really not interested in another story.

Schmidt","Surprisingly lovely and worth reading, despite haters hating","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2017","I think this book deserves to be on the high end of four stars -- I really liked it.

The only character that was really amiss was Harry, and the main problem there was his dialogue.  He just didn't sound like himself at all until later on and during the scenes with Dumbledore's portrait (who totally WAS himself, far more than Harry was, even though he was just a portrait and apparently wasn't supposed to be really real *rolls eyes*).  But I could still imagine real Harry doing the things he did in this play, just not the way he's portrayed as doing them here.

The rest of the story was wonderful, the time travel sequences deeply affecting and profound (and heartbreakingly hurried), and the idea that this whole production goes on in a staged performance is a bit mind blowing.  I'll have to see it myself.

I loved the new characters, and yes, of course it was all terribly hurried. IT'S A PLAY -- it simply has to cut to the chase.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

And despite that fact, the timeless themes of friendship and finding surprisingly wonderful people in the least likely places (i.e. Draco Malfoy's progeny and the first Potter to be sorted into Slytherin) shined through the imperfections in a wonderful way.  I loved the closure that this story gave readers to Snape and how he would be remembered.  I loved the moment where broken-past-present Draco reflects on his relationship with his wife.  I loved the dialogue between Albus and Scorpius.  I loved Rose Weasley and wished we could have seen more of her.  Hermione as Minister of Magic was a bit tough to swallow (so soon??) but whatever.  Ron was funny.  The trolly lady growing spikes on her hands was a bit much. To be sure, I could imagine her doing something intense and scary to students trying to the leave the train.  It just didn't need to be spike hands  (－‸ლ)

Ok, I could go on.  But I liked it.  There was heart, there was closure, there were beautiful moments with great new characters.  It's not a Harry Potter book like the others, but it was a J K Rowling story worth taking the time for.  I'll likely read it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Give it a chance.","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016","It is important to note that this is a SCRIPT, not a novel. Given that, this SCRIPT is good. I enjoyed reading it and being back in the wizarding world, knowing that all the characters I have loved for years are okay and still up to no good-- even their children. It was a fun read.
It is also important to note that our dear JK Rowling is not the sole author, as she was in the original 7 books. There are two other authors who contributed and, most likely, Rowling just approved and edited the final story. Knowing this, it is easier to accept that this is very different compared to the original 7 books.
I do have issues with certain aspects of the book and think that, in some instances, it boiled down to pure convenience, not logic. That, however, is not enough to make me dislike this script and regret having read it. I absolutely loved it.
I suggest reading it for yourself to form your own opinion but I believe that many fans are being too harsh on it, given the important notes I listed above.
The main thing I had issues with was how long it took Amazon to ship and deliver this book. I pre-ordered Cursed Child months ago expecting to have the book arrive on my doorstep on July 31 only to be disappointed and forced to wait until August 3 to receive it. I could have understood delivering on August 1 since the 31 was a Sunday, but the 3rd was a little much. I am not likely to ever pre-order a book from Amazon again because of this (and Target had a better deal-- $17.99 for the book and a free poster with book purchase).
Overall, this was a fun read and offered a great amount of closure for myself and the left over feelings I had after finishing Hallows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Read with caution :-)

This is a good book. It was entertaining and a nice, quick read. A word of warning to Harry Potter fans: It is VERY different than the main books. It doesn't feel like a continuation of the book. It's a shame that it was marketed as the next chapter as, to be honest, I don't think it fits that well with the main book. There are some odd parts and some of the rules of magic aren't entirely consistent (The time travel aspect in particular is really bad.) However, it's nice to see new characters and old characters brought back. Some people really hate the way Harry is portrayed as he's kind of a jerk at times. However, I quite liked this. Harry isn't put up on a pedestal and shows human flaws. To be honest, I thought Harry was portrayed as flawed in the last two books of the main series as well, so I'm not sure why people are so upset about that aspect.

Overall, a good read, but don't expect it to be the same as the main series. Look at it as a JK Rowling endorsed fan fiction and you'll be much more satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling's imagination. While this ""rehearsal script"" for a theatrical production (first stage in London on July 30, 2016) is frenetically paced and (at least on the printed page) lacks much of the novels' spirit of whimsy--their rich depth of colorful, if often superfluous detail--readers do get to reconnect with many of the most-beloved characters in the series once again, and there are a few interesting (and essential) new characters as well.  Young Albus Severus Potter finds it increasingly difficult to live in his famous father's shadow; Hogwarts for him is no Hogsmeade holiday, only his friendship with the shy and lonely Scorpius Malfoy offers consolation, and Scorpius is himself dogged by dark rumors about his parentage. Mischief and rebellion are in the air like a swarm of dementors, but this mischief won't be quite so easy to manage when the two friends endeavor to change history.

That's the story in its broadest outline. The plot of ""Cursed Child"" draws on the earlier books, most heavily ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"", but a thorough familiarity with the entire series is assumed from the beginning. This may be problematic for some Potter neophytes, while ""purists"" who claim to adore The Boy Who Lived but can't abide the notion of his ever growing up or changing (as real people so often do) will find a fair bit to complain about--but don't they always?

Yet, by and large, the source material is skilfully mined for its 'quantum possibilities', the resulting story is often quite clever and, in moments, moving, poignant, and insightful. Rowling has once again given us an engaging magical tale that is also a compelling story of relationships (fathers and sons, friendship and love, family past and individual destiny) human emotion, growth and the understanding that comes with experience and maturity.

Recommended with the caveats noted above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_159?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=159&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Bringing back beloved characters from the Harry Potter septology, and expounding upon briefly mentioned or entirely new ones, with all the wonders of magic and wizardry, this is a worthy addition to any HP fan's shelf.  However, the story felt a bit 'tacked on' - squeezing another drop from the septology's plot, a bit contrived in its twists and turns.  I do quite like the ambiguous title and the sense of mystery throughout; how does the title apply?  Who is it referring to?  In the end, it's still nicely unclear, with more obvious candidates and more subtle suggestions.  Another thing that bothered me, however, is that the returning characters seemed rather.. out of character.  Typical speech habits, patterns of behavior, and even seeming personality traits have been lost or replaced.  This may be a side effect of the story being told pretty much entirely through dialogue, but none of the characters feel fully developed by the end, and the whole thing felt rather like fluff, like decently written fanfiction rather than Rowling's usual intense style (though of course she was not the sole author of the script).  I did find myself rather amused by the occasional descriptions of characters' behaviors, and bemused by descriptions of magic performed or experienced, wondering how on earth they managed to pull that off on stage.  Perhaps someday a video recording of the play performance will be released, and the story will feel a lot more immersive taken in its intended format.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As I started reading it there was some hesitation on my part because of the names of Harry’s children, as they are all characters from the past, named to honor them and it took me a moment to shake that they were not the Albus, Lilly, or James of before.  It also takes a moment to get into the grove of reading a play over a book itself.  One thing I was concerned about was not getting the emotion or the internal monologue of the characters throughout the story, that has not been an issue, as there are cues throughout that give insight into that aspect.  I found that it was very easy and adaptable to read, I know that this is a large point of contention, but it seemed natural to me.

This is a story that spans a lot of time, the transitions are clear, and it paints a very vivid picture of the time.  It uses transitions or snippets, think of Snape’s flashbacks growing up, to move through some phases or years at a time.  We start with Albus's first year, but we end at his 4th year.  As someone who wanted to digest as much as possible in the world of Potter World, this actually worked well for me.  There are elements where you're able to see Albus change over time, which I enjoyed.  The whole book is not structured this way, but early on in the play there is a leap of a few years from its initial start to when the action really takes place.

The primary action is based on Albus Potter, Harry’s son, who is a bit like and unlike his father.  Albus is faced with engaging at Hogwarts and adjusting to an environment in which he is living in the shadow of his father.  At the onset of the play you think that Albus is going to follow in the same friendships as his father, but it quickly is determined otherwise and Albus’s friend is a Malfory (you find this early on).  Albus attends at the same time as his cousin Rose, the daughter of Hermine and Ron (she takes after Hermine a bit more).  Albus and Scorpius (Malfory’s son) become really good friends and extend the universe of Harry Potter into looking at another family in a different way and with more glimpses of the Malfory who we occasionally saw towards the end of Harry Potter.

Harry himself throughout the play is struggling with some of his responsibilities in fatherhood, but his own lack of a father plays a role in his self-doubts of how well he is doing with Albus.  Harry was able to conquer Voldermort, but sometimes a teenager can be difficult, and very frustrating.  Harry's interactions with Albus remind me a bit of the weaknesses that Harry would show as a child, but was made better by Ron and Hermonie.  Meanwhile, James and Lily (siblings) play a bit of a tangential role to Albus who is the youngest.  Hermonie and Ron are also not very present in the story, but enough so that we at least have a sense of re-connection with them and what it is that they are doing in their lives, as well as their histories, which play a vital role. Ron truly is characterized by a lot of the humor that was once seen in his older twin brothers.

It's difficult to talk too much about what makes Albus function without giving away some important details, but this is more so his story, with his new friends, and how he is adapting in a seemingly different way than his father.  Albus wants to do right for himself and even the past of his father, which leads to the main story line of Albus re-visiting some of Harry’s past losses, in particular Cedric. Cedric’s father is perhaps the most heart wrenching of all elements of the story, still exactly where he was at the end of the last time he was encountered, mourning the loss of his son.  It’s an excellent re-introduction into the world of Harry Potter, as it intentionally goes through past memories, reliving some of them, as well as looking at them from a different perspective.

It's a play, which I think maybe hard to reconcile while reading.  Plays have very different styles than novels, hence why it wasn't necessarily just written by Rowling, but has contributors who take the story and make it into a play. There is a significant amount of imagination that has to go into the story, which is a bit different than Rowling's other books, as the actors are depicting the scene, as well as scenery that contributes to the imagery.  Again, I think it does a good job filling in these gaps.

Anyway, there’s a limited amount I can say, it’s pretty awesome.  I hope you enjoy it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's very clearly stated, but some reviewers seem shocked that it was not a novel.  Second, enjoy this for what it is.  I consider the play to be a continuation of the series, but it is a play.  It cannot have the intricate  storytelling of a novel.  If it did, it would need 100 stages and last for several days.  I enjoyed the little bits of new information about the adult versions of our trio and even seeing how Malfoy turned out as an adult.  I thought the overall story was good, though it has left me trying to do some math.  I'm going to have to read book 7 again.  Had it been a novel, I think that the characters would have been more fleshed out and perhaps truer to their book selves.  But, again, it's a play.  I consider it its own thing and am not comparing it to the books. I liked the overall story and there were some surprises in there. It was fast-paced because it's meant to be performed.  I got the rehearsal edition script and it's 308 pages of the actual play.

Also, to help some who complained about the format, it seems making sure you know how to read a script is a good idea.  Some complained about having to look to see who's talking and to read descriptions of the stage.  So, just to clarify, again, it's a script.  It is organized like any script.  I'm not an actor and the only scripts I've ever really seen are reader's theater scripts for classroom student productions.  So, the basics are as follows:

The character speaking is listed before the dialogue. The dialogue has no quotations because it's a script and the fact that it has a character name attached to it implies it's spoken.  There are stage directions in italics that describe what characters are doing and that set the scene.

If you keep in mind it's a play, you'll find it enjoyable.  I did. I read it in a few hours and there were a few parts where it was definitely a page-turner.  I'll now happily add it to my other Harry Potter books on my bookshelves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First, should it have been a book instead of a play?  I would have liked to have had it be a book (or even a series of books, as we could have seen the development of the next generation), as that would have allowed more detail and character development, but the play was OK and if the authors were looking to tell a good story without spending too much time and effort to write a whole book, they succeeded.  The pace moved quickly, I'm sure prompted by the limited time a play would allow, but it kept me involved and there were a sufficient number of surprises to keep me interested.

A lot of people didn't like the people Harry and his friends had become, but I found them to be believable adult developments of the kids we knew from the books.  Was this the only way they could have turned out?  Of course not, but it was one, reasonable, way.  The only one who I didn't like was Ron, whom they made out to be little more than an insignificant, silly and almost meaningless piece of fluff.  Granted, in the books he was the least important of the trio, but he still played a significant role. In the play, they could have left him out entirely and it could only have served to improve things.  On the other hand, I liked the way Harry and Draco interacted.  And Ginny continued to show herself as the marvelous person she was.

The whole thing about time travel - a lot of people didn't like it.  Given that they had introduced time turners in the books, the canon certainly gives credence to the concept and it presented a lot of opportunities for Albus and Scorpius to meet some of the characters from the books and grow to know their parents better, which I think added to the story.  It also presented some alternative timelines that were interesting and helped the boys to learn several important life lessons.

Some said that this didn't seem to be written by J. K., but I thought there was sufficient body to the story and characters that her involvement was clear.  True, it wasn't up to her level of detail and magical fun, but to be fair, I don't know how much more could have been fit into a stage play.  The pace was much too fast for much more development.  As I said before, there were still enough surprises and development that I thought it was reasonably well written.

The gay thing.  First, regarding the boys.  Perhaps it was written a little touchy-feely, but both boys showed interest in girls, so I think their closeness was primarily from intense friendship, caused in no small part by their loneliness and rejection by the other students, and heightened potentially by latent homosexuality generated as a reasonably normal learning about relationships by sensitive young boys.  As far as Dumbledore is concerned, I know J. K. has stated that she always considered him to be gay, but the way he was written in this story, I'm not sure this applied to his feelings for Harry.  If it did, then his feelings toward Harry would likely be beyond simply gay and be more those of a pedophile, which would have gotten him into trouble at some point in his career as a teacher and headmaster.  I think the feelings he expressed toward Harry were more along the lines of the love a father would feel toward his son.

Finally, if I could find a major fault with this story, it is that it was a piece of fluff compared to the books.  In SS, I was drawn into the magical world by wonder and the fun twists and turns of the things Harry encountered as he learned about this world he was born into but didn't know at all.  As the books went on, the story became ever darker and more intense as Harry found himself driven toward his fate.  This made the stories more involved and attractive to older readers, such as myself.  The epilogue in DH was bordering on fluff and a bit less satisfying because it was so nice and predictable.  Upon finishing the play, I found myself feeling much the same way as I felt after finishing DH.  The play's story was enjoyable and drew me in, but the ending left me feeling a little bit sugary.

In summary, then, if you're expecting a story of the intensity and detail of the books, you'll be disappointed; but, if you read it accepting that it is a play and, therefore, must move at a faster, less-detailed pace, I think you'll enjoy the story.  Harry and his friends are still there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I love the plot of the story, I love the characters, and I love the author. But this book is a little bit different...

If you didn't know, this book is a script book. So the writing is a bit different and a bit hard to follow. So if you are a Harry Potter fan, I will tell you this is NOT like the other books. It is a play in London.

Also, most people are upset about what house Albus is in. I know, it's different, but this book is supposed to show that Albus dose NOT want to be like his father.

But here's one thing that kind of upset me. I wish that the author was only J.K. Rowling. I think that the book might have been different if it was only her. But the other authors were still wonderful.

And lastly, the book lacked adventure. Which was also upsetting. But it was supposed to have a lot of heart and it definitely did.

So read this book. It will make you laugh, cry, and stay awake all night.

The time turner plot becomes a bit convoluted and overlong, but the characterizations make up for it. Scorpius is by far the best character in the play. Albus is a brooding, sullen and somewhat annoying teenager. Harry's clashes with him are believable. Harry could certainly be all of those things himself and at a similar age.  Hermione is probably what I pictured as an adult. Ron is ill served here and his daughter Rose seems like an alternate version of the character in the epilogue. Even the dialogue is changed, Maybe the time travel changed other things around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This a script for a play.  It has been lightly adapted, if that, to be a little easier to read like a book but make no mistake this is a script.  You need to remember in a script it depends heavily on verbal dialog, there is not a whole lot of internal thought or scene descriptions which are such a rich part of the HP universe.
If you go into this thinking it is going to pick up right where HP left off, you are setting yourself up for disappointment - as you can see by some of the reviews here.  Some folks have seemed to have missed what is printed on the cover - this is written by Tiffany and Thorn based on a story by Rowling.  She did not write this, she wrote a story that they have adapted as a play with much liberty I am guessing.  So Potterophiles who obsess over details will freak out at some of the liberties they took.
That said, the story if fine.  It is not without flaws in some of the character development.
SPOILER ALERT - things I did not like and did not feel were plausible - how Ron turned out.  He was full steam ahead as an auror with Harry.  He takes a deep third fiddle role in each reality as if the writers kind of dismissed him.  Although the roll as the funny Uncle I can see.  Cedric - in one reality a death eater.  Malarky.  I don't see this happening from being embarrassed in any scenario.  Just seems as the HP series reached an apex that not even a Slitherin went as dark as he did in the storyand he was a super popular Hufflepuff with a good, loving family.  So nope, that scenario we so unlikely it was a distraction.  Last the timeline of Delphi being born.  That who scenario is also a tad outlandish, I just don't see that happening.
Aside some unlikely possibilities, I enjoyed the visit back to the HP world.  I liked seeing the interaction between Harry and Draco and would have loved to see that developed more.  There were a few gems in their interactions.
Would I love to see an actual book fleshed out by JK herself (and correcting a few flaws), absolutely.  But this was entertaining as I think the play would be as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry is head of Magical Law Enforcement, Hermione is Minister for Magic, and Ron runs the family Joke Shop. And, as seen at the end of _Deathly Hallows_, Harry and Ginny have three children, and Ron and Hermione have two.

Albus Severus Potter goes off - somewhat reluctantly - to Hogwarts, where he befriends Scorpius Malfoy. Both of them are Sorted into Slytherin, and they become fast friends.

But all is not well with Albus. He lives under the burden of being his father's son, and it irks him. He feels that he cannot please his father, and what's more, that his father doesn't need him - that his older brother James is Harry's real son and he's, well, the spare.

One evening, Albus overhears his father discussing, with the aging Amos Diggory, Diggory's desire that Harry use a time-turner to undo the killing of his son Cedric. Albus meets Delphini, who introduces herself as Amos's niece, and together they plot to do what Harry will not.

Of course, things go awry, and saying how would fall squarely into spoiler-land.

It's interesting to read this as a play, with almost all the plot advanced by dialog - though there is a fair amount of stage direction, too. Most of the old Harry Potter cast shows up in some form or another, and the world, once again, is threatened to be plunged into the Hell of Dark Magic.

The scriptwriter, Jack Thorne (Rowling and director John Tiffany collaborated on the story, but the script is by Thorne), does a pretty good job of capturing the characters of Harry and Ron, Hermione and Draco, a couple of decades on; and does an excellent job of presenting the new characters.

I enjoyed it a good deal, and will shut up now before I give something away that I shouldn't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The idea of time turning was great in its introduction in book three where they could only go back a few hours, but the idea of going back years and changing the complete history by casting a few spells just seems much too powerful to be messed with by any wizard.

I will admit I was put off by the play format.  It's awkward reading.  If she didn't want to write another book, then I'm not sure why she couldn't get any number of highly qualified best selling authors to take her play and novelize it, as they do all the time for movies.  I think of some of the top flight authors who have written the novel versions of the Star Wars movies for example.  They may have been shooting for artsy, it came across to me as lazy.

That aside, I thought the story started a bit slow and muddled and it just didn't feel like a JKR story, until about half way through then as I stated at the start of my review, it picked up, got me hooked like the original books and I got the JKR feel.  Overall for Potter fans it is clearly a must read.  It also shows that there are lots more possible stories for Harry and cohorts to be told.  I just hope that the next one is a novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It's, as usual, a complex, character-driven story, with lots of surprising twists and turns. The theatrical medium is essentially different -- everything is handled through dialogue, stage action, and scenery (which is described in the text, but not seen). Rowling collaborated, but the characters and ideas were still clearly hers.

The consequences of the kids' actions were dire and interesting. Her work follows through on its premises and goes places that, traditionally, children's fiction wouldn't go. It is that willingness and imagination that puts her work  consistently in the realm of greatness. Fantasy, at its best, ask big questions and provides big answers that can be profound, in the right hands. Rowling's Potter series has so far always delivered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I know we'd all like to think that Harry was a model parent, but the reality is, parenting is hard. We all make mistakes, trying to find our way. Maybe the joy his first two children were kind of blinded him to the struggles Albus faced, just by being the son of the ""famous Harry Potter"". The alternate realities seemed to give some insight into the personalities of our protagonists. Reading a play is not easy. I would love to be able to afford to go to London and see this staged! It must be ...magical! (couldn't resist.) There are flaws but this is just the rehearsal script...the final version ought to be more polished! Plenty of *Spoiler* reviews here, so I didn't reveal anything. I think this book/ play is clever (as the Brits say). It's not our revered seven books, but if Jo did write this as a book for 39 year olds, she seems to have succeeded. And I borrowed my copy.

I knew that it was written in ...","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2016","I started into this book extremely skeptical.  I am an enormous Harry Potter fan, notorious for anxiously awaiting every previous book at their midnight release, devouring them all through the night and not sleeping until I completed them.  This book I never had that same anticipation for, which in retrospect was probably a good thing.  I knew that it was written in a play format, so that kind of made me leery.  But eventually I succumbed - I needed more of the Potterverse in my life!

So the book started off slowly and was honestly pretty corny.  It read a lot like the epilogue from HP7, if you understand what I mean.  About halfway through to book, it started developing and had some trademark Rowling twists and turns.  The little snippets of old characters that I missed so much made it completely worth the read.

My advice to you is to go into the book expecting it to be different from the previous books.  It is a very different format and therefore a very different read.  Lower your expectations - don't expect to have J.K. Rowling's intelligent flare for writing and skill of wit on every page, the way we have been used to in the past.  There will still be demonstrations of this in the stage direction and the dialogue, but it will be different.  With those expectations going into the read, I was thoroughly entertained and appreciative of this addition to the Harry Potter story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I don't question that the London premier production is handling all these special effects magnificently, and wish I could see them do it in person. But if a school or community theater could manage them all, it would amaze me no end. And as a play, it seems largely to rely on these special effects, in an effort to beat the movies at their own special-effects game. The scenes are short and choppy; and it was sometimes difficult to follow which character(s) were the most focal ones. As a piece of theater, it came across to me as straining too hard to do too much. And even at that, I found there seemed to have been something crucial cut out in the subplot about Cedric Diggory. I should have preferred a more in-depth treatment with fewer scenes, but longer and more fully-developed ones; and something that school and community theaters could do more easily. I may be wrong: my fellow Harry Potter fans may find all the magic razzle-dazzle the important thing; but much as I have always enjoyed reading plays, I think I would have preferred this story in the form of an eighth novel, maybe even a trilogy of novels sequelizing the septology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I saw alot of posts pissing and moaning about how no one but J. K. Rowling should write about Harry Potter, but I felt Jack Thorne did good by the characters she created. The story even touched on some crazy fandom fanfics I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were even parts where I straight up cried.

In all, if you are looking for another Harry Potter book, this is and isn't it. It continues the story but in a different prose. With her novels, you view the masterpiece from a distance. With Thorne's writing style, I felt like a third wheel in an exciting, magical mess, frantically trying to piece together what was happening instead of it being methodically laid out to view.

It is for the die hard fans, which deserves 5 stars. For the casuals, definitely at least 3.

 Hearing about another Harry Potter novel coming out I was like, GASSSSSSSSPPPPPPPP!!!!!!
 That was like the most exciting news ever!
 But when I found out it was a play I was sort of discouraged.
 I had a lot of doubts about this novel/script when I first heard about it and after hearing several opinions I had to wonder how much I’d like it.
 After all that time, fans came up with their own theories about what happened after the Deathly Hallows and wrote fan-fictions that were actually really good.
 So to have their dreams and ideas get stomped on by a play…well, I can see where the mixed reviews come from.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child follows the story of Harry’s son Albus, who’s starting his First Year at Hogwarts with worry. Living up to the Potter name isn’t easy, and apparently one day can change the course of your life forever. Harry, who is now the Head of Magical Law Enforcement has his own problems to deal with and being Father of the Year isn’t one of his priorities. While Albus struggles through school and tries to figure out how to be more than Harry Potter’s son, a devious plot starts to unfold with the threat of Voldemort’s return.

Reviews and opinions of other Potterheads aside, I didn’t really hate the eighth book as much as others did.
 It was certainly different but it still had that Harry Potter charm – just in script and dialogue form.
 I am also guilty of writing my own future fan-fiction, but it was nice to see what J. K. Rowling wanted for the Potter future (even if it wasn’t what any of the readers were expecting, and even though she didn’t really write the whole thing).
 I wish there were more books and more detail into the characters and their histories. What we got was just a glimpse of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and even Draco.
 To me, the book was just another story to add to the collection – something sort of separate from it.

Harry Potter and The Cursed Child was every bit as magical as any other Harry Potter novel – just with less detail. The characters are relatable (yes, even Draco and his son Scorpius who is still my fav) and believable. Maybe there was a little too much teenage angst but at least it was understandable. Albus struggling to be his own person and more than just Harry Potter’s son. It’s a burden, and even with Scorpius trying to be more than just Draco’s son.

In my opinion, anyone who’s ever read or written their own Harry Potter Fan-Fiction in the past several years will probably be somewhat disappointed by this script – I mean if I can be honest, it sounds a little bit like fan-fiction anyway. Still, this continuation of the Harry Potter novels is still very enjoyable and entertaining. I just wish I could see the play – or at least they should sell DVDs of it. I would definitely buy it.

It takes a little time to get into the flow of the script.  Once you become used to the flow, the reading of the book goes quite quickly.  Because of the time needed for a well-timed play, there are some holes that would have been filled if this were an actual book.  J.K. Rowling would have filled the gaps that are there for the play, but since a play usually runs about two hours, it is not possible to fill all of the holes.  On point is J.K. Rowling indicated this would be the last of the Harry Potter books.  This play leaves one opening where Delphi will be sent to Azkaban.

Mason","Because who doesn't love more HP, but you're not missing a lot....","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2016","Honestly, who wasn't wanting more Harry Potter? It's why I finally caved and picked this up when my local grocery store had a sale if you carried a store card.
Because I live under a rock and was not paying attention, I did not realize this was the script for the play. However, as they say writing lives and dies by dialogue anyway, I was not majorly deterred.
I loved that this picked up one last 'what if' bit, and honestly answered a question I had had about Bellatrix Lestrange for a long time. Did I think the characters were maybe a little weaker and not as well fleshed out as in the books? Yes. Did I also think that because I was reading a script and not a book and not watching the play, that that had something to do with it? Yes, most definitely.
To any Harry Potter fan, this is a must add addition to your collection. It will give you pain when finished, as, once again, we must bid adieu to our beloved series. However, was it the end-all-be-all that was the last book in the series? No. I feel that while I found it very interesting to read and find out facts about the past and future in this series, it certainly did nothing to better the original books, simply add a little more interest. If you never pick it up, I don't think you're missing too much, but I do believe you'd find it worth your time if you do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The bribe worked and she really enjoyed the book, which is less of a book and is a script for a play. She actually liked it being more of a script and finished really quickly. A fun fact that I learned until after she finished the book was that she was texting her Harry Potter crazed friend (who already read this book before she received hers). After every chapter, she would text him her reaction.

As much as she loved the book, she's especially a fan of the two leading male characters, she did have a few issues with Harry and a couple of other characters.

It was fast and engaging story.  I liked Albus Potter very much and felt like there was enough depth to his character to warrant another seven book series. That being said, I think there were some rough edges.

I knew reading a script wouldn't be my favorite kind of read, and almost everything I didn't like about the book could be put down to that fact. Reading a script is choppy, and without visuals or music, characters can feel very flat.  On top of that, there's not as much scope or time to give background information, explore feelings, or any of the usual methods utilized in a novel of fleshing out characters or evoking emotion. The screenplay was a unique presentation and I sincerely hope that I get a chance someday to see the play (or a movie), but I still wish it had been a novel.

The only other criticism I have is that the adults, which by now we know and love, have apparently regressed to their fifth year juvenile mentality.  You'd think that working together to defeat the dark lord, marriage, and kids would have given them at least a modicum of maturity.  Apparently not. They are continually, almost laughably, overreacting. Both their disagreements and their collaborations seemed very stereotypically pasted together, mainly because there wasn't time in the plot to delve into any kind of mature discussion. Fortunately, their interactions were kept to a minimum and my inner director had them tone the drama down to acceptable levels :-).

Overall, though, I would recommend this book as long as you are willing to read for fun and not take it to seriously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was probably one of the few people who originally wasn't sure about reading this book. Yes, it's a Harry Potter book, but I had read up on it when this was first announced, and realized that J.K. Rowling didn't actually write it...instead, it was the 2 playwrights. In my mind, this was fine, but I didn't like the fact that they were marketing this as ""another Harry Potter story"" and ""by J.K. Rowling"" (I mean come on, you can't blame people for not thinking that it's written by her when her name is in big bold letters on the cover of the actual book!). However, I thought to myself, what kind of fan are you if you don't give this book a shot? I felt I owed it to myself to see where these beloved characters were in the future, and what the world was like for them now. But because of this, I went in with slightly lower expectations. I wasn't expecting that same love to come back, because after all...there's only one J.K. Rowling, and virtually no one can come close to this woman's amazing writing skills. However, I honestly greatly enjoyed reading this novel, and I even though I had my complaints, I loved being back in this world.

There is definitely a lot to love about this story: the magic, the strong friendships, and full of twists. Was the plot my favorite? No...I think a stronger plot could have been created, but I also remembered that this has to translate to the stage. So in that way, I understand why the plot was the way it was. The one thing that I thought came through very well was the emotional toll that all of the events of the past had on Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco. I honestly felt their raw struggle while reading, and I thought the writers did an excellent job at translating this in the script. Obviously, everything that these characters went through in the Harry Potter series took a significant toll on all of them, and it changed them irrevocably.

But this does lead me to one thing that upset me a bit while reading. This is a common complaint, but these characters that I know and love and feel like are family, didn't always act how I would have ever thought they would. I found Harry to be extremely harsh and rude at times, and yes, Harry was always a bit blunt and sarcastic in the books, the extent his character went to in this book was so unlike him. Hermione is awesome as ever, but I felt that she was even dulled down a bit. And Ron, while definitely used as comic relief in an otherwise dark play, got relegated to a side role that had no depth. Now is this because our trio truly wasn't supposed to be the main focus of this story? I don't know, but this was the conclusion I came up with while reading, along with the fact that this is also a play and characters aren't always given the same amount of depth as in an actual book.

However, I did LOVE Albus and Scorpius (Scorpius just a little bit more though). They were both great characters, and I adored their friendship. This was where this book shined because it showcased how unique situations can bring together the most unlikely of allies and form the most beautiful of friendships. I can understand why people are shipping them (heck...I am too)!

Overall, I think that this is worth checking out for any HP fan. Is it going to blow your mind, absolutely not. Will every single HP fan like/love it? No. But if you go into this book with an open mind, remembering that J.K. Rowling only offered slight input into the story and didn't actually write it; along with the fact that this is not the 8th Harry Potter book, then I think you will enjoy it. It's very easy to forget that this is even written in play format as it reads very easy and smoothly. I will tell you one thing though, I would absolutely love to see this as the play. I'm sure that just reading the script can't even remotely compare to the emotion and the exquisiteness that the actors' would bring to these roles. Check this out when you get the chance and get back into that world that shaped so many of our childhoods. You don't want to miss it!

Happy reading :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have been pumped for this ever since it was announced in 2015. I grew up with Harry Potter; I have read the books many times and havd watched the films many times. I own the ultimate editions so that I could have as many bonus features as possible. I recently bought the illustrated edition of the first book and plan on collecting the rest.

So it should come as no shock that my expectations for this story were very high. I read this script in just under 4 hours compared to the 3-4 days it would take me to read the books when they came out. So I had a lot to process quickly. One thing that stood out to me was, despite this taking much less time to read, the play feels epic and a good bit of time passes within it.
 Upon finishing, my feelings were mixed to negative. Some creative decisions were truly puzzling to me. But then I remembered that this is a play, not a novel or even a film. Visualizing this from a theatre perspective, I certainly gained an appreciation/understanding of why this story was told. Upon thinking even more, I want to re-read it and could find myself loving it.

Essentially, this story is about a parent and child learning to understand one another and appreciate one another. This is true for Harry and his son, Albus Severus and Draco and Scorpius (and another character that would be a huge spoiler that I won't mention). The contrasts between the fathers and sons are emphasized, hence why this story feels different from any other Potter story before. Albus Severus and Harry have almost nothing in common except blood. But what few traits they share are what bring them closer by the end.

Other beloved characters pop up. While they seem to behave in ways much different, we have to understand that they are at a different time in their lives and that (once again) this is a play. So certain things are played up for drama or comedy. Aside from the great new characters of Albus and Scorpius, I thought seeing Harry as a middle-aged adult was fascinating. My other favorite character was surprisingly Draco Malfoy.

If I have a criticism, it's that this story sometimes feels like a ""greatest hits"" of thr Harry Potter series. Upon re-thinking, I don't feel that way as much because it focuses on key events from the pass, not every event. It brings the past, present, and future together in a way that makes sense for the characters in this story. In my opinion, it actually does further the story quite a bit. And if Rowling or Jack Thorne ever did decide to continue this story, they certainly could take it to some interesting and different places.

My main issue with the play is not a big one, but it has to do with the villain. I like the villain, and the concept behind the character is interesting and plausible. However, I think an opportunity was squandered to go in a fresher, more inventive direction.

All in all, my opinion on this script has changed for the better. I actually appreciate the story and do consider it canon. There is an It's a Wonderful Life vibe to this story, and many of the creative choices do work, while some are more puzzling. Some plot points would benefit from a full novel or even a film in order to be fleshed out. However, I'm sure that watching the play is absolutely magical for any Harry Potter fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Read it! Perfect for Fans of the series.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2016","Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by J.K. Rowling is the long-awaited 8th installment of the Harry Potter series that takes place 19 years after the fall of Voldemort. Unlike the other books, this one isn’t a novel, it’s a screenplay for those (like me) who couldn’t attend the play in London this past Summer. Unlike most, I loved having this screenplay. I knew it wasn’t going to be a novel, that most likely it would fall short of my expectations but I was still excited. Can I just say that it met my expectations and then some!

I think the novel of this book is getting to see my favorite characters as adults, my own age, dealing with their kids and the hassle of every day life. Harry and Hermione work for the Ministry of Magic, Ron’s taken over the joke shop, Ginny is her mom….I seriously loved this! Harry after 19 years still has nightmares about the battle of Hogwarts, his role in it and his connection to Voldemort. It’s interesting to see the aftereffects, seeing the post-traumatic stress that surrounds these characters, the fear of Voldemort somehow returning, and the grief they still feel 19 years later for those they lost.

The real draw though is reading about their children and their adventures at Hogwarts. I loved Albus, like absolutely adored him. He’s a miniature Harry through and through. He’s constantly in trouble, an outcast and even in his own family has a hard time relating to his dad. It’s interesting to see how similar and different the story is to Harry’s own story. My favorite character of the book though is Draco’s son Scorpius. He’s misunderstood, an outcast like Albus, and somehow he understands Albus better than anyone. The two strike up a friendship very similar to Ron and Harry and I just love them. Scorpius is the exact opposite of his dad, but at the same time I believe he is who Draco could have been without the pressure to follow Voldemort.

The plot of the play revolves around an outlawed, not-supposed-to-exist time-turner. Albus gets his hands on one and well that’s the story, a misguided attempt to save a boy killed by Voldemort which results in big changes. I didn’t care for the use of the time turner in the story. I felt like it was too familiar for fans of the series as we’ve been there and done that when Sirius was saved. However I still found myself engrossed. I read the play in one sitting, about 4 hours. Remember even though it’s 300+ pages, it’s a screenplay. It does not take long to read dialogue. If you’re a fan of the series, I highly recommend you read it. It’s a fun, nostalgic romp with your best friends…erhm I mean favorite characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The relationships between the characters are great and the abbreviated way the story is told works great - things build quickly and then the real story starts - full of great surprises and wonderful evolutions of the characters you loved from the novels and the scenes carry a great deal of weight when performed on stage.

It's a strange thing - as a friend pointed out - imagine if the next Star Wars movie only played in one theatre in the whole world and tickets were impossible to get so all you could do was read the script.

I’ll admit it. Rowlings stories continue to be magical, even twenty years after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone came out. I’m sure I don’t need to go into the back story of Harry Potter for this review, because if you don’t know it, why the heck are you here?

Cursed Child takes place nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny are in their forties, and have kids in Hogwarts. This book focuses mainly on Harry and Ginny’s second child, Albus Severus Potter. Albus is very unlike Harry: he’s in Slytherin, for one, and counts as his best friend one Scorpius Malfoy. Harry, being Harry, and Albus, being a teenager, butt heads constantly, their personalities pinging off one another like rocks colliding in midair. I’m not going to get into the plot very much (or really at all), as I can’t find any way to describe it without HUGE spoilers (and god, but I hate spoilers). Suffice it to say that we get to revisit some classic bits from the original series, as well as find out some new stuff about the Harry Potter Universe.

Now for the nitty gritty: the book is not really a book but rather a play, which is going on in London right now (though again, if you didn’t know that . . .). What that means is: this book is written as a play, with dialogue and stage directions but little else. I’ll say the dialogue is spot on. I think the authors (Thorne and Tiffany) did a great job of capturing the characters. The dialogue flows like Rowling wrote it, and you can easily hear the character in the lines. the bad part of this is: it’s mainly just dialogue. There’s none of the little wonderful extras Rowling would slip in between the lines, the depth of field that makes the Potter Universe so compelling and so real. I’m sure seeing the play live takes care of most of that (can’t wait!), but in the reading you feel a little bereft.

The adventure is fun and engaging. The duo of Albus and Scorpius are just as compelling as Harry and Ron. And it’s great to see how the characters we already know and love, not just the big guys but also Professor McGonagall, Draco Malfoy, and others have gotten on since we saw them last. Potterheads are going to love this expansion to the universe. My only wish would have been to have the thing rewritten into novel form by Rowling, but perhaps that’s just me being greedy.

Ferlisi","Not a Harry Potter Book. Great script.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","So here's the thing that I think a lot of the reviewers are missing. It's a play. I've been reading and interpreting plays for over a decade (I'm an actor, a director, a playwright, and a theatre teacher). There is a god plot behind this play, some meat for the actors to make it their own, a bit too much stage direction for my like, but not an obscene amount. There are some technical things that would be a little difficult to produce in live theatre, and it needed to start a bit later in the timeline (as watching actors age on stage is harder to pull of than on film). But this was a good play. It is NOT a Harry Potter book, and doesn't read like one, doesn't feel like one, doesn't do a lot of the things the 7 books do. It was nice to revisit this world in a new format with the fresh eyes of adulthood returning to characters that were familiar but completely different (like having coffee with a good friend from high school that you haven't seen in 10 years). A warm hug from a new friend. Read it (it's a quick read even compared to early Harry books). Enjoy the new mode of entertainment, it takes a while to get use to reading stage plays (which are written different than screenplays - which other reviewers are calling it).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

One, this is a script for a play, not really a book. It reads like a play, the details offered are those you'd get in a play (stage directions and so on). It's easy to read but this is a different kind of Harry Potter book. Two, you won't have to worry about what they left out when they make the movie as you know they will. There isn't much that they could leave out. Three, if you were worried that this was going to ruin the series for you - don't. It holds up the Potter flag. You won't be disappointed.

In some ways, this reads like fan fiction. What happened if... and they got Rowling involved to make it all work. And it does work. You will enjoy the story, you will believe these are the same characters, and in the end you will care about what happens to them. I can't give it 5 stars mostly because I wanted an 8th book, and this isn't that, it's a lot less detail and a lot less story. But it was a whole lot of fun.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece! It takes off right where Hallows left off with the first scene being practically word-for-word with the final chapter of the novel. The play's main focus is Harry's second son Albus and Draco's son Scorpius. Since the focus is primarily on new characters and not on Harry, Ron, and Hermione, this has a different feel than the novels. It deals a lot with Harry's relationship with his son, which I thought to be a really well-written exploration into Harry struggling as a father. The overall plot is good. It's not as good as the novels, for it's kinda a smaller story. It's interesting to see the three friends older, but I wish the play showed more of them. It took a while for the plot to move, but when it did, I was hooked. There was a few cringe-inducing lines, but other than that, the dialogue was charming. It can get a little confusing at times, for this is meant to be seen performed on stage, not read. I would love to see the production when it comes to Broadway! Overall, if you want to see what happens after Hallows, this is well worth your time! Again, those expecting it to be Harry Potter Book 8 quality will be disappointed. But for what it is, it's a decent addition to the Potter universe!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I know, not the least from my high school Shakespeare that reading a play is a far different experience from seeing it performed.  Unlike Shakespeare, JK Rowling's so-called ""8th Harry Potter story"" is written in the modern vernacular so it is easier to follow!

We re-encounter Harry Potter as he drops his children off on platform 9 and 3/4.  One child - Albus - is starting his first year at Hogwarts and is sorted, not into Griffendor house like his brother, sister, mother, and father, but into hated Slytherin.  There he forms an unlikely friendship with Scorpius Malfoy, son of Harry's arch-enemy Draco.  When bad things happen to Albus and Scorpius (as was inevitable), Draco and Harry, as well as Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione, must bury the hatchet and work together to rescue their wayward children.  To say any more about the plot would spoil the surprise for the reader, and perhaps remove from the impact of the story.

It is not perhaps the plot that is most important, but Harry Potter fans can be assured that this ""feels"" like a Harry Potter story, it's just the format that's changed.  Rowling's signature flourishes and plot twists are on ample display.  At the same time, there is far more humour than in the novels, perhaps influenced by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, Rowling's collaborators.  Ultimately, the biggest praise is to say that this really is the eight Harry Potter story, and if the main character is Albus Potter, Harry's fans will get to see him too, even back at Hogwarts as we remember him from Stories 1-7 (how that comes into this story you will have to learn for yourself!).

The format - reading a play - is not ideal, but for those of us who have not been able to jet off to London or New York can make do and enjoy the story nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The books are untouchable and there's an absolutely magical quality that can't be recreated.

I've been a big HP fan for years, of course, and was eagerly anticipating the release of this play.  I don't think it was as good as the original seven novels, but I didn't expect it to be.

It seems the main problem people have with this story is that they feel the characters didn't behave as themselves.  I disagree.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione were never perfect people; they often 'forgot to remember' lessons they'd already learned, and acted in selfish and reckless ways.  I think it's perfectly reasonable that Harry would grow up into someone who gets overwhelmed easily by circumstances he doesn't feel he can control and who acts more out of emotion than out of rational thought (which is how he always was).  Similarly, it's more than believable that Hermione grew up to become a by-the-book Minister of Magic... when was she ever not by-the-book?  Rose judges Slytherins for being Slytherins not because her parents didn't raise her well, but because she's a child and children are influenced to some degree by their peers, no matter what their parents do or say. I think one of the best things about all the characters in the HP world is that they are written as flawed, and even though they learn from their experiences and grow as people, they are still flawed - to have them not be would be completely unrealistic.

I really enjoyed reading this book.  The plot of it wasn't as great as the original seven, but how could it be when it wasn't written entirely by Rowling?  I don't think I'd sit through a 5.5 hour play version, but I'm glad we got to see another chapter in the HP world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Dracos son is really like I imagined him to be as well I imagined he would be kindove nice and he is.

As an avid HP fan for over a decade, I can honestly recommend this story to HP fanatics that have always wanted kist that little bit more from the magical world.

I do believe that to see this on stage would change the way most view this script; it's meant to be watched and not read. But it's a great compromise for fans who cannot attend the London show.

Is it perfect? No. Did I smile, and laugh, and feel? Absolutely. And those familiar Potter feelings are all I could have ever wanted from a new HP book. Even if it did feel fanfiction-y.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child takes readers (and lucky theater patrons) back to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World for one more adventure with beloved characters and new friends and enemies. The script splits its time between the adults and their children, mainly Harry and his younger son Albus, whose relationship is strained under the weight of their family's legacy. Things don't get much easier for Albus when he's sorted in Slytherin and befriends Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry's still-nemesis Draco Malfoy. But after eavesdropping on a conversation between Harry and an elderly man still grieving over his son, Albus resolves to steal a Time Turner and fix one of his father's biggest mistakes - a decision with potentially dire consequences.

As excited as I was about Cursed Child, I had my reservations since Rowling didn't create the story alone. But I quickly found myself settling in for the ride and enjoying myself, even laughing out loud at the comedic bits. Most of the returning characters were portrayed accurately (or, matching my impressions of older yet recognizable versions of themselves), and I remembered why I loved (or hated) them all over again. The new characters were also wonderful, especially Scorpius. Yes, a Malfoy was my favorite character this time! But he's kind, nerdy, a voice of reason for Albus, and a hopeless romantic for Ron and Hermoine's daughter Rose. Reading a script was an interesting experience, too. The bare-bones stage directions allowed me to imagine or recall each setting and spell however I chose, and I appreciated that.

I have a BIG problem, though, with Delphi Diggory. It's not her character per se, but her true ""parentage""... It defies logic, from who her parents are (really?!) to the timeline of her birth (and the implications her mother's pregnancy would have had on past HP events). Some fans have also criticized the ""queer-baiting"" in Albus and Scorpius's friendship. I can see where they're coming from... but it reminds me of a similar debate over Frodo and Sam after the Lord of the Rings film trilogy was released, and I didn't agree with that opinion. All I'll say here is that it made sense to me for Albus and Scorpius, two young and awkward boys who are shunned by their peers, to become as close as they did.

Anyways - yes, I'm happy with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It's not my favorite HP story by far, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Now I'll be jealous of anyone who's fortunate enough to see the play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_147?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=147&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

People who were expecting a whole new series to be folded into these pages were destined to be disappointed. It is probably time to move on from Harry Potter and stop expecting so much from a series geared towards children. of course it is going to disappoint as adults.

I did enjoy getting a glimpse of the next generation of wizards and witches in the magical world of Harry Potter. This book would be confusing and frustrating to read for those unfamiliar with the other books and films because it implies and references past storylines.

The main complaint I read in other reviews was that the characters weren't written like they are in the other Harry Potter books. While I can certainly see their point, I truly felt that the characters were only different as all adults are different than we were as teens. From 17 (the age Harry is in Deathly Hallows) to 40, most people change significantly. Plus, once you get married and have kids.....it changes you.

This story is written like a screenplay, so if you are expecting a lot of scene development you will be greatly disappointed; however, if you are a TRUE fan of The Potter series this book will just further expand your love for the world of Harry Potter. The story was great, character development ok, scene setting minimal. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't a traditional Harry Potter book you are expecting. I enjoyed the read, but the lack of scene setting seemed almost lazy to me. Either way, JK Rowling creates a wonderful story to further my love for the magical world, and I will continue to read anything she puts out about the subject.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Although I struggled at first with how the book was written out for a play script rather than a normal novel. However once I started to get a flow for how it read I could not put the book down. I found myself so fascinated by every thing that was happening I loved seeing harry and his great friends Hermione, Ron, and Ginny from a different angle as parents all grown up. I thought the story moved a long at a fun and magically fast pace, which kept me interested and excited about what was going to happen next.

 I highly recommend this book to anyone. If you loved the old harry potter books or movies, you will enjoy reading this one as well. It takes you on a exciting adventure through the magical world of Hogwarts with some of the original characters and locations as before. This will reignite those wonderful memories you had with the old adventures with Harry and his friends. In comparison this will give you a new and refreshing adventure with there kids and how they go about fighting dark magic with great twists and turns through out the whole book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This newest installment isn't a HP novel, and it doesn't read like one.  It's not even by J K Rowling, though her name appears on the cover.  However, I still enjoyed the story.  It was interesting to read Harry as an adult, struggling with his teenage child.  The play does feel a bit like fanfiction in spots--the time turners, the alternate universes--but at least it's fanfiction endorsed by JKR.

Wood","it's understandable why some would express a bit of disappointment in this latest entry into the Potterverse","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","Let's just get this out of the way: This is a script, not a novel. It says that. On the cover. Above the title. Why people seem to be surprised and/or confused by this is beyond me.

That said, it's understandable why some would express a bit of disappointment in this latest entry into the Potterverse. While reading a script it is entirely up to the reader to imagine things such as location and dress. It's not an immersive experience the way a novel is. Perhaps, for this reason, people are missing out on how truly wonderful a piece of work it is. Perhaps, without the assistance of Rowling's prose, this is why people are claiming it ""reads like fan fiction"".

If that is the case, it's one of the finest examples of ""fan fiction"" I've ever read.

The story focuses more on Harry and Ginny's son Albus and his friendship with Scorpius Malfoy. The two young men bond over their unfortunate legacies...both having to live up to (or live down) their infamous fathers. Both are intriguing characters and the story takes a particularly interesting turn (spoiler-free pun intended).

Give it a read. Read it carefully and give what the characters say time to resonate. Use your imagination to build sets in your mind. You all have an idea of what Hogwarts looks like. Tap into those image. Then you can enjoy the story for what it is, which really is quite wonderful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It is in script form but I didn't find that distracting at all. I enjoyed the story although it was ""softer"" than the original series. You get to see into the hearts of Snape and Dumbledore along with visiting with some of the other favorites of the original series. If you like Harry Potter (or love it in my case) then you'll appreciate this extension.

I understand some of the disappointed posts but we all know this wasn't written by Ms. Rowling and sequels are rarely better than the originals.  This story is post Harry Potter and the children in this story know nothing of violence and loss, unlike their parents, so their actions/reactions are understanding.  Harry Potter and gang have also lived in a post chaotic environment in the numerous years beyond what occurred so to some extent, their reactions are somewhat acceptable.  I encourage you to read this book with an open mind.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was amazing and emotional and would be for any Potterhead. The script format was confusing to follow (hence the 4.5) but I loved the storyline(s). You have to approach this script focusing on the storyline, the world-building, and the characters. NOT the fact that you're reading a script of something supposed to be performed...otherwise you'll become irritated and not enjoy what's happening. The beauty and allure of this story, for me, is that it allows readers to revisit the magical world of Harry Potter and his friends. Yes, it's a play, not a novel. NO, J.K. Rowling didn't completely write it. Yes, it's a lot different than the books we grew up reading over ten years ago-but the characters are different-they're adults, married, with children and jobs. The story is emotional, frightening, and funny even, some characters are pretty snarky.  ;) I got watery eyed during several scenes and really liked several lines-one being from Harry- ""I've never fought alone...And I never will."" (*SOBS*)

CRAZY things happen in this story-alternate realities, nightmares- you will be shocked, you'll cry, you'll laugh, and your heart and mind will be flooded with the memories you had of the first time you met Harry Potter.  What I would give to see this on the stage....","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_180?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=180&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I will not include spoilers but there is a big one that makes the story very interesting!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_177?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=177&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I personally think that they made a mistake releasing this as a script where JK Rowling should have written it as a novel. First, the plot: it's genius. It incorporates the Time Turner used in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and it advances the plot in all the right ways, especially the nostalgia it brings. It brings us back to scenes from the original book series and it's really interesting seeing how Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy's sons tamper with time (or don't tamper with it).

The biggest problem is the writing. It's evident that this was not written by JK Rowling. The dialogue just doesn't fit the characters, especially Harry, who's attitude and temper has changed completely. It just doesn't seem natural at all. The dialogue also comes off as really cheesy sometimes, with dumb puns and one-liners that JK Rowling would never write (and for some reason they keep using the word ""discombobulated"" throughout the book which was annoying).

It's obvious as to why many people will be disappointed with this. But it was hard for me not to smile in scenes where they revisit major scenes of the original books, and see them from different perspectives. The plot twists that are here are fantastic, and it should be made into a movie eventually (WITH TWEAKED DIALOGUE). I enjoyed these things so much that I was able to overlook the weak writing. Give it a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Originally, I never had any intention of buying or reading this book, so it was a spur of the moment buy. I liked this book because I've read all the other Harry Potter books and seen all of the movies, so it was easy for me to imagine the script as a true story more mentally than not. I loved reading about Scorpious and Albus. I wish the authors had made them an item, instead of Scorpious pining over Rose. Alas, that did not happen.

Not really. Anyone who expected that is going to be sadly mistaken. A script is not a novel and does not come across as one. You are not going to be transported to the wizarding world as easily and it is harder to connect with the story and the characters. You need prose or to see it performed for that. But, if you can use your imagination to transport yourself into this world, you won't be disappointed. The characters you love are there along with new ones, the story is very grand and reminiscent of the books. The story is more about relationships between characters as opposed to an overly magical setting and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how relationships between some of my favorite characters have evolved as they grew up more and their relationships with their children.

I've read other reviews that said the story and characters are flat and two dimensional, again I believe that is a problem with the way a script reads versus a novel and I think many people are going to be expecting something different. I've also read that people found inconsistencies between this and the books. I didn't notice anything major, but I also have not read a lot of the extended universe material.

Overall, I really enjoyed the story and format and this is definitely worth a read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

For me, this script book was a very fun addition to the HP universe. I felt that it didn't detract from the original series at all, and stands as it's own ""expanded universe"" sort of title. It walks the line between ""Canonical Potter Story"" and a fun experiment with familiar faces. The character interactions are wonderful. I especially enjoyed the characterization of the Malfoys, who seemed to steal the show in every scene they appeared.
There were some nit picks and plot holes throughout but they were pretty minor.
Overall, it was a lot of fun to get back into Harry's world. Cursed Child seems destined to be the black sheep of the franchise...which is fitting because Albus Potter is really the same way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I understand a lot of the frustration from other reviews. Here's my take on this: this story is meant for a play that's roughly 4 hours, and need to appeal to both kids and adults and none Potter fans.

Truth be told my review is purely biased based on how much I've missed the Harry Potter series and craved for new material. the story is not nearly as intricate as JK's books, the plot offered nice surprises for me, even though some 'surprising arcs' you can definitely see them coming.

The best comparison that I have for the play is Star Wars the Force Awakens to the old school Star Wars. Was the 7th episode the best? No. Did it play with my nostalgia for the originals? Yes. Did I willingly let the movie play on my emotions? Yes. Did I enjoy the new story? 100% Yes!

On the other hand I have to say I saw the lower ratings first hence lowered my expectations. But there are some material in the book that made me very much excited for the actual play! I cried reading this book! Multiple times as well!!

I believe because I was roughly Harry's age when I first read the originals, and now I'm well into my adulthood and facing the same 'family dilemma', which led me to relate to the story again. If you go into reading this book with an open mind, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book as much as I did!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_179?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=179&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

(A) This is not a pure work ...","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2017","I have been a Harry Potter fan ever since the books came out. I've read so many negative reviews about this written script and I see why people don't like it. (A) This is not a pure work of JK Rowling , there are 2 other co-authors.  So, the characters that we've grown to love seems ""out of character"" because of different word choice. Again, this is not purely a JK Rowling work. (B) This is written for a play format, thus the characters in the play have to state out loud the emotions they are feeling. How can the live audience know what they are feeling if they don't say it out loud? Unlike in the original books, we know what's going on inside their minds because we are reading them off the book. Thus, again, the characters seem ""out of character"" because of this. (C) The book/script is fast paced because the whole script/book covers Albus' journey through Hogwarts up to their fourth year (I think). It is unlike the original books where each year has one book dedicated to it. This is my objective review. lol. Now, I docked off one star because (spoiler alert), why is Albus devoid of talent? Like zero? Not even one? I thought we inherit intelligence from the mother, isn't Ginny a vivacious talented witch? He is brave, for sure, but his stupidity caused all the trouble in the world. But I guess that is why we have a story. Harry's son got insecure, so he starts on a reckless/stupid journey to prove something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

From Albus' fear of being sorted into Slytherin and his initials being ASP - a kind of snake - I suspected he might go that way. Thus is Albus a  kind of Sirius Black in reverse. And even though Harry couldn't have been happy about this, at least he and Ginny didn't disown Albus like Sirius' mum disowned him. Albus has to deal with much by being the child who is quite different from the rest of his family - something I can relate to! Like Ron, he has a lot to live up to with previous illustrious family members. Couple that with ones troubled teen and pre-teen  years and it is no wonder he has difficulty with his relationship with Harry. We can't expect Harry to be the perfect dad.

I wish this were a novel instead of a screenplay, and I also wish the antagonist was not Moldy-Voldy's kid. That is OOC to me. I can't see The Dark Lord, who was not only determined to not share magic, but also to not die, ever thinking he would need to possibly procreate. Shame on you, JK..Voldemort (most precious, in his own words) would not think himself fallible, nor would he be willing to share even the tiniest piece of his magic or DNA to create an heir. ""Bad guy"" should have had a different origin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling. Do not expect the same style","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019","I am happy i bought this overall... The book itself is not in any way written by j.k. Rowling. Do not expect her style of writing. It is however approved by her so i feel that's an important point to note.

This on my opinion is a fantastic book to have it you are a true Harry potter fan. It dives into the young Albus' life. And tells a different kind of story than Harry potter ever was. It is not about Harry anymore, but about his son. It is a lot about their bonds and how harry is learning to be a father now at this point in life.

It's the first time i have ever read a play besides in school. I read it in one day. It is not a long book. I mean it's like 300 pages but the text is spread out quite a bit. I had a great time reading it too... After starting, and this is the reason for four stars, it got slightly confusing with the quick flying through the years of Albus' life. I did not enjoy that particular part of the book very much and that's the point where i really noticed the different writing styles the most. i thought to myself i never would have gotten through all the Harry potter books of they were anything like that. I feel it could have been some thing like, beginning at Hogwarts, giving the background needed to get the story then go on to four years later and tell the story. That part was annoying and it's something i knew was going to end and i was just like, okay when will it be done. That is the only critical thing i have to say about the book. Which is pretty good since I'm choosy about my books. The screen play does not bother me a bit, I actually felt more there in the story than a lot of other books.  The story itself was great, i thought the characters were spot on,the personalities perfect, ups and downs and stuff i didn't expect but that added to the story so much. i love the overall additions this adds to the HP library... I still separate the Harry potter books in my head from this book but it's probably just because i have only read it once so far. I ummm love Harry potter, it's the best series i have ever read. I can read the books over and over.

AS a side note; I watched a documentary type deal on j.k. Rowlings decision to allow Jack Thorne and John tiffany to make this and she said she refused dozens of offers over the course of years before allowing any third party people touch her Harry Potter story. She did not decide on this book lightly. It is a great story and i would say a must of you are a Harry potter fan like i am. Even if it's separate In your head from up you'll be glad you read it, i was anyway. Hope this helps someone to decide. It's money will a on my opinion.... Also where else are you going to get an entire days worth of entertainment for $10??? Worth it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It is somewhat of a continuation of the series, but the feel of it is a bit different. I would have suggested that they take off the Harry Potter in the title of the book and called it something else to stir people away from their expectations. All in all, i really enjoyed it. I was a little hesitant to read it at first because of all the negative reviews, but i felt like the writers did a great job with this story. The set up and the pace is a little bit different from the original books because it's written as a play. However, after reading the book for 5 minutes, i was hooked. I read it in one sitting (it's not a long read). It wasn't a perfect book (it had its up and downs), but i thoroughly enjoyed it and was really entertained. Please note though that is not much of a story about Harry, Ron, etc.. It is a story about their kids. With that being said, it did also did a good job of revisiting old memories I had of Harry and his friends.

I enjoyed being immersed in the wizarding world of Harry Potter again.  This story focuses on the next generation of wizards, specifically Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy.  These two sons of famous nemeses form an unlikely friendship during their first year at Hogwarts.  The play fast forwards time quickly through their years at Hogwarts while also presenting the reader with each sons' difficult relationship with their fathers.  Harry Potter, the beloved orphan-turned-wizard hero who everyone loves has difficulty bonding with his middle son.  What an overwhelming reputation for a son to live up to!  Scorpius has to deal with his own problems and devious rumors that make him an outcast as well.  The friendship between Albus and Scorpius plays out nicely and leads to a fun and eye opening adventure that causes many problems to be solved.

As much as I liked this book, I felt it was a fast read and left more to be desired.  I missed the detailed descriptions of the wizarding world that I loved in the original books.  This book/play moves faster and doesn't have the same attention to detail.  But that shouldn't stop anyone from reading this book.  I loved the way the angst of being a teenager and parenting a teenager was played out.  The story still focuses on friendship, courage, and love, which was so much a part of the previous books.  I would recommend this story to all Potter fans, who I am sure have already finished it!  I do hope to see the play one day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I was thrilled and the idea of seeing what the Wizarding World had been up to since the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, but was terrified that this would become just another cash-in sequel like so many other franchises seem to do these days. I should have known better than to think Rowling would tarnish her creation by simply cashing in. What's been released is an exciting, well crafted extension of the original 7 novels that, in some ways, fixed some of the issues I had.

Without saying too much, I really loved this. It is not entirely perfect, but it is damn near close. The play format took a second to warm up to (I haven't read a play since college) but once I got up to speed, I felt like the format actually worked better than expected as it allows so much of the reader's own imagination to fill in the gaps that would otherwise be descriptions in a prose novel. Because of the play format, the pacing is a bit different than in previous stories, but again, it works quite well. The amount of story told between these covers is larger than I'd ever anticipated. And though the pacing maybe lend itself more towards theater, this is a Rowling story through and through. Do not worry that working with two other writers may have watered down the J.K.-ness of this tale. There is no question that this up to par.

I cannot wait for a full production of this to hit the States. With so much action, magic, heart, and visits from characters and locations both new and old, this is sure to be a hit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The authors of this book did a good job capturing some crucial moments in the Harry Potter history. I was moved when I read the part with Severus Snape, it was hard to read the final part where Harry has to witness his parents' death.
The only thing that drives me crazy, but this happens all the time with time-traveling stories, is that I kept on wondering why Harry and friends did not decide to just go back in time and kill or capture Voldemort when he is young. Wouldn't that be easy?","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_174?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=174&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm also a huge Harry Potter fan, having read the entire series around 8 times, so I was very excited for this. This is a good read in general, but definitely doesn't stack up to the original series. The style is very different and the plot feels thrown together and not as meticulously planned out as the original series. The plot is reminiscent of fan fiction about the characters as opposed to a published work, and is at times outrageous. I felt that parts seemed out of character or not compliant with statements J. K. Rowling has made about this timeline. This being said, this book was enjoyable to read. I found moments poignant and humorous. I enjoyed Scorpius' character a lot. My advice would be to not expect this script to be as amazing as the series. Treat it as a separate work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I enjoyed the story and thought it was well thought out and developed and it had enough twists to keep it interesting.  It is however a script and not a novel.  For those not used to reading scripts I imagaine they would find this a challenging read.  Much is left for actor's, director's interpretation in terms of emotion of the actor.  It also uses stage notation which if one is not used to reading would make the story more difficult to follow.  In all it is a play I hope to see a production of at some point, or a movie.  As a high school drama coach my thoughs were often about how difficult this play would be to stage and how difficult the effects would be to produce on stage.  I understand the British production has done a very good job of bringing the story to life.  The scrip could also easily be addapted to be a movie, and in some ways would be better suited that a movie production.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_80?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=80&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

So, of course I was super stoked for this one. Without giving away any spoilers, I will say that it is a lot darker than I expected to the point that it became a bit of a slog around act 3. Also, keep in mind that it is a play script and not a novel so it does lack some of the richness of description as you would have in the books. I would not recommend this for someone who is not very familiar with the Potter universe simply because without the visuals or more descriptive language they would probably miss some of what is happening. It also reads a bit like fanfic, complete with a Mary Sue. That said, it was still an enjoyable trip down Nostalgia lane. All your favorite characters make appearances (even some you might not expect to see) and is worth adding to your collection if you love Harry Potter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If you lack imagination or creating an mage in your mind about what is happening, you may not enjoy this book.  Very little character and scenery description, you will have to make it up or recall from other books as you go along.  Could have been so much more.

After the books and the movies, we now have the play. Next I expect there will be the pop karaoke album, the puppet show, and the interactive wizard work out DVD with bonus spells.

They're just not going to let this guy retire are they? 142 years from now they'll have an actual 'Harry Potter Flying Broomstick' and The World Quiditch Championships will replace the Olympics, though instead of holding it every four years, it will be held every four hours, except on Christmas Day when it will be take place every forty minutes – and that will be enforced by law.

So, is this any good? Well if you like bespectacled (or should it be, bespeckled? No, that means having spots. But then Harry Potter is a teenager, so he may have spots. 'Cause you get them at that age. But that has nothing to do with wearing glasses. Just like peaches have nothing to do with suspension bridges. Now where was I?) Oh, yeah if you like bespectacled nerds who are forever waving their symbolic phallus wand in people's faces, then you may get into this. If, on the other hand, you believe that Harry Potter has introduced children to the black arts of Beelzebub and has corrupted the whole world with his evil satanic witchcraft then you probably won't. Mind you if you believe that you probably also believe that aliens from outer space invented Chicken McNuggets, 9/11 was carried out by Santa's elves and Kim Jong-un should win the Nobel Peace Prize. There's also a nice padded room waiting for you at the local asylum.

So Harry Pot Plant fans will love this, but they love anything with his name on it. If Ted Bundy changed his name to Harry Potter he'd become loved and revered overnight.

Hey, there's an Idea. J.K. Rowling's next book should be 'Harry Potter and the Charismatic Serial Killer'. I bet it would still sell millions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Thompson","Good But Expensive","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","First of all, this is a play. It's not going to read the same as the books. You're not going get any kind of fleshed out story. That fact did not prevent me from enjoying what I was reading. I did read it all in a single sitting. I do think the price is quite steep for no more than you're getting here.

Second, I could hear Ms. Rowling's voice the same as in the books so I'm pretty sure her hand was definitely in the plot. I could actually hear the familiar voices saying the lines and even without a lot of description of the scenes, I was able to see the action in my head. So kudos for that to whoever did write it.

I would, however, love to see more of Albus' earlier Hogwarts years. I felt they were not given the attention they should have been in order to get a better feel for his attitude about being the second son of the famous Harry Potter. Considering how little we do see of those early years, I have my doubts that seeing the play would be any more satisfactory.

Overall, I do think this is worth the read but definitely wait until you can borrow from the library. A $15 price tag is just ridiculous for no more than this is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I knew that going in. With children involved in acting, I have my fair share of experience reading scripts as I help them run lines. Still, it took some getting used to. Gone is J.K. Rowling's finely crafted prose. What is left is dialogue and a few brief descriptions. It requires much more use of imagination.

I honestly would love to see it performed. I could easily imagine it as a movie with a great deal of special effects. I have no idea how they could handle all of them on the stage (even given the huge budget they must be working with.) It's also hard to imagine anyone but Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter. As I read the book, I pictured the actors from the original set of movies.

The story is not up to the standard of the first seven - it would have been a miracle if it could have been- but it was enjoyable. It picks up where Book 7 left off. In fact the first scene is actually the last scene of that book, with Harry and Ginny and their children at Platform 9 3/4 sending Albus off to Hogwarts.

One major story line focuses on the strained relationship between Harry and Albus. There is a great deal of time-turning going back to scenes from the original books and changing history in the process. It also allows now-deceased characters such as Cedric Diggory, Severus Snape, and even Voldemort to play a role.

Overall, this is an enjoyable story as long as you don't go into it thinking you are going to get a repeat of the magic of the first seven books.  There are some definite plot holes in the story and much of it is a reworking of things that already happened. But still, it was fun to reenter the world of Harry Potter and see what the future held for the characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

They forget that this is a script to a play that's supposed to be watched; the brilliance and emotion would come from how the actors enact it on stage with all the lighting, props, sets, costumes and action. This isn't a Harry Potter Eight book - that's the thing people should understand before even attempting to go into this. There will always be naysayers, but I for one am glad that I get to read the story, even though I may never get to watch the play. Imagine - if she didn't release this, you won't get to know the rest of the story if you couldn't afford flying out to London and buying theatre tickets - along with hotel stays and whatnot.

Now on to the story. I was so happy to revisit my favorite characters (naming them all might spoil the story). My heart ached with a nostalgic feeling when seeing Albus and Scorpius interact with people that were left behind. I think Rowling wrote this to put some of her regrets to rest, to say things that were left unsaid in the Harry Potter books. This book is a new story and closure (for some characters) all rolled into one. This is for those who loved Harry, Ron, Hermione and all the other brilliant people that Rowling brought to life.

I am glad of all the new things I learned about Harry and all his friends and foes.

Rowling (sure there is some dispute on how much she wrote) 4.5 out of 5 stars in my book review that I promise to not give any spoilers.  HP and the Cursed Child is an all around is a fun fast read for high school students and up.

I know there are a lot mixed review on this book, but I still say definitely give it a read.  Though, there are a few things that it is best to remember going into this book.  First, you have to remember that this book is a script. Scripts are different from your traditional novel.  To be honest, I forgot that at first.  The first 20 pages or so was a little frustrating b/c I wasn't getting the detail in the setting, characters, story development, etc.  However, after I remembered that little, but crucial, detail I really got immersed in the story.  I have always felt that it is too hard to compare the books to their movie counterparts.  They are different, and they each have different strengths.  I feel the same thing applies with a script to a novel.

There were several things that I really liked with HP and the Cursed Child.  I really liked reminiscing with the old characters.  I really liked seeing the story continue.  There are some awesome quotes/lines found in the story that I had to write down.  I'd love to share all of them with you, but I promised you no spoilers.  Therefore, I'll share just this one from Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. ""I, uh, I opened a book.  Something which has- in all my years on this planet- never been a particularly dangerous activity."" This quote makes my librarian book loving heart smile.  Even though Scorpius is not my favorite (I was never a Malfoy fan either), I LOVE this quote.

Now, it is true, and somewhat shocking that a Harry Potter book didn't earn a perfect 5 star rating.  Though, I've always been a tough grader and that doesn't change.  I'm not comparing the script to the other books b/c they are different (script vs. novel), but I am judging the book as part of the series and that is where it falters.

Since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a continuation of the story I was disappointed that the characters were not always consistent with who they were in the first 7 books.  Hermione was known for being clever in the original series, but I didn't think she was her consistent witty clever self in this book.  I felt there were inconsistencies with Ron and Harry's characters as well.  I don't want to give too much into why they were inconsistent b/c I don't want to spoil a single aspect of the story.  However, it is the inconsistencies with the characters that is the major reason for the less than perfect score.

I still thoroughly enjoyed reading the script book.  I found myself feeling many emotions in the reading.  I was incredibly happy. picking up the book, and concerned, worried, sad, curious, surprised, and more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_163?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=163&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

WHAT DID I THINK??? It was another Harry Potter story: I freakin' loved it!","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016","What did I think? WHAT DID I THINK??? It was another Harry Potter story: I freakin' loved it! Bear with me, ""I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."" (Kidding, I'm going to do my best to make this vague and spoiler-free.)

If you loved the story so much, then, Amy, why only 4 stars?? It wasn't the fact that it was a script - within a page or two, it really was very easy to make the transition to reading it as a story (stage directions as description, being able to follow along with the dialogue and not hearing the speakers name before each line, etc.). A point on the sparse descriptors in the stage direction: because of its lack of in-depth descriptions, it challenges the reader to really use their imagination, and I found this wonderful (I understand, however, how those that are not like me, i.e., total Potterheads that devour everything HP and Pottermore related, may have had trouble with some of the act and scene segues). So, on to the explanation of the 4 stars and my reasoning behind it: the first, and probably the easiest, is that the dialogue did not always sound exactly like JKR's (this, I do find understandable, as it was written along with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany); second, the end felt a bit rushed (it can be argued that this plays into the urgency of their actions, but I think a bit more in the happenings department really could have enhanced it); and lastly, it BEGS a sequel as I felt there was a HUGE question, as well as a few minor ones, that need more resolution, but alas, I have heard that JKR is completely done with Harry Potter, so this may never happen. :(

In all, I highly recommend this book to any and everyone that loves the Harry Potter world. Really great fun!!!

I found this to be a fun story, however less believable at times than Rowling's first 7 books. This is probably due to the fact that there is much less detail in a script when compared to the original books. As a play I can see where they can fill in those details with talented acting and set props to make it very entertaining. This book reminds me more of an outline for a full story. I was hoping for more details about their lives over the past 19 years but not much was offered. Instead it really built upon the friendship of albus and scorpius and their complicated relationships with their fathers.  Overall a fun read and just enough of a peak into the current life of Harry Potter to satisfy curiosity. Would definitely recommend to harry potter fans. As for those who haven't read the books yet (maybe you have been hiding under a rock for the last 15 years) they are definitely worth reading before diving into this one because absolutely nothing will make sense to you if you have not read the books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_199?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=199&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Get this fact through your head first before purchasing and expecting the same phenomenon we had with the books that were written by her. I was so intrigued to see how one of the outcomes could be for life for all the characters from Harrys life and how it turned out to be put into a play. Overall it was great. I had 0 complaints, the plot was cheeky, had unexpected turns, and its very nice and warming inside to see life after Harry and Hogwarts for all of our favorite characters. Especially reading about everyone's kids and how they are all to continue on to hogwarts and how they all cope and which adventures they run into. Ofcourse id love to see JK Rowlings actual Adaptation of life for all the characters after ther books but we all know that, that wont happen because it just isnt right. Nevertheless this was a nice distraction, a nice reminder why im so obsessed with the wizarding world of Harry Potter and it was a nice plot.

Liang","It's a screen play.","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2016","I don't know Jack Thorne's work, so I can't say if this is how he presents his plays. I don't know how much of a hand or say Rowling had in this production and the screen writing.

I understand the frustration with this novel and the plausibility of many things and how it all connects together with the 8 novels.

First, don't read this as a regular piece of literature. This is a screen play. These are scripts, lines for the players, so I read it as so. Scripts can't be read the same as literature. Example: look at how many times Hamlet had been remade and portrayed differently each time. One line can be repeated several ways and the effect will be different each time.

Second, time has passed. Harry and everyone are no longer teens. They are adults, parents who have kids, and they are working. So yes, I expected them to change in some way. Did I expect Harry to be a good parent? No, he never had stability in his life. And I think they tried to show that in his parenting skills or lack of.

Third, This is the Magical world. And right when we think we know the world, another thing pops up and suddenly we question it and try to see how it fits into the magical world. Yes, poly juice potion takes a while to make, but this is a screen play! Think of it like a movie? The protagonist will some how have the key/answer/solution and they somehow have what they need to make everything right again. So yea, this screenplay does fit into the cliches of movies.

And seriously? Humiliation to an extent could change Diggory. But becoming a Death Eater? Sure, we just don't know how bad the humiliation was to him and the effects of it to know how he became one. There are several gaps in this play because of the ever changing universes, and it seems we have to fill in those gaps and attempt to understand how a character changed.

Maybe it was because I came in with such low expectations or maybe it was just because it's a great story, but I loved it. Yes, it's different from the original books. It's more character and dialogue driven, it is a script afterall, and because it's a script we miss out on some of the details that help really bring a story to life.  Also, it's a little more mature, Harry and the gang are forty now and some of the jokes kids won't relate to. But I don't think this story is really for children. Many of us grew up with Harry Potter, but now we're adults. This book deals heavily in relationships, mainly between fathers and sons and I think it did a great job. I know that many people were mad with how Harry acts towards Albus, but if there is one thing this book teaches us is learning that those you love aren't perfect. Though this book differs from the first seven it still has the components that made those seven great; adventure, heart and friendship. Also guys, it has time travel. Let me repeat, time- butterfly effect- travel. Which helps to tie it back into the world of the first seven books. The while time I was readibg it I thought; I can't wait to see how they do this on stage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I don't particularly care for reading plays, if I did, I would have read far more classical literature.  I was also concerned because I thought this might change the way I view the other items of the Harry Potter canon. With some trepidation, I finally pre-ordered yesterday and scarfed down the story today because I wanted to dig in before spoilers start boiling out.  The jury is probably still out on whether we'll see a movie adaptation of the play, so... Dig in, I did...

To be honest, yes, I do have some mixed feelings.  The confrontation between Albus and Harry broke my heart a little.  After everything Harry has been through, Harry after all should know that others' words and actions do sometimes leave hurts and ripples...  But, Harry is, of course, frustrated and let the heat of the moment get the better of him--he's only human.  It makes sense to me though, that the survivors of the wizarding wars' offspring would struggle a bit to find their own identities, especially the offspring of some of the younger, more notable characters' offspring.  Notoriety casts a long, warped shadow and humans (whether muggle or magical) are often cruel.  I so think these scripts do shift long-held character building a bit in places, but one does have to remember the adults lived through a war and a significant amount of time has passed since the first seven books.

I did really like some things in these scripts. I really liked Scorpius.  I thought it was wonderful that Albus and Scorpius were portrayed as not being afraid to show--and (gasp!) even talk a little about the fact that they really cared about each other and their friendship really meant something to both of them.  In mass media, it's so rare to find stories where young men express platonic friendship and emotions that go along with it. There are also a few telling scenes with Draco Malfoy that I really liked here.  Particularly where he says he always envied Harry's friendship with Ron and Hermione (I think any reader with a functioning brain realized that he was always jealous of the quality of friendship(s) between Harry, Ron, and Hermione) and that it can be very lonely being Draco Malfoy.  And where he tells Harry that Scorpius is all that he has now and is genuinely worried for his son.  Yes, in the past, Malfoy was more than just a misunderstood bad boy; he was a downright dangerous prat in a lot of ways in the original books (but he was also a product of his damaged up-bringing having been raised by fundamentalists).  Let's face it, though, Draco could have just taken off and gone after Scorpius on his own son, had he wanted, and maybe not changed at least a little over there years.  While I don't really know that I hold to the stance that he ""owed"" Harry a ""debt"" of any sort after the events in _The Deathly Hallows_, I think this definitely shows that Draco has changed a little over the years (whether thanks to experience, Astoria's influence, or so on, we will probably never know).  If Draco had been more like Lucius or the young, arrogant Draco we first begin to know from the original books, he probably would have just tried to save his son (and only his own son).  I also liked the wee peek of Snape that readers get in one of the timelines.  In the end, I think Albus and Harry are on their way to reconciling and I think that's okay.  It shows that not all relationships do--or should--come easily.

I'll admit that at first, I was a bit put out at the time-turners' role in kicking off the bigger events.  Time travel stories are always a bit tricky, I think, because people either seem to love or hate them.  It does make sense to me that post-war certain elements of wizarding society might seek out people to make new time-turners since the known ones were destroyed an the battle at the Ministry (_The Order of the Phoenix_).  Disregarding potential wrong-do-ers, especially amongst the collectors of artifacts, I can see the post-war appeal of the time-turner.  I also think it was a shame we didn't at least get a peek at Astoria and Draco's interactions, because she sounds interesting.  Between the advice she gave Scorpius about sweets and making friends, and Draco's (brief) reminiscence, it seems a bit of a loss (even though this wasn't the Malfoys' story).  I can see where some Cedric Diggory fans' noses are going to get (at least) briefly put out of joint, but... Well, I kind of feel like readers never got to meet Cedric to a great extent before he died in _The Goblet of Fire_.  While it's profoundly sad that a seemingly mostly-kind, thoughtful boy died so needlessly (as a ""spare""), it's not like readers had known him well from book one all the way to book four (_The Goblet of Fire_).  In the end, though, I think this volume honors the ""fallen"" characters of the original books well.  War leaves marks in many ways.

Overall, reading this was time well-spent.  I do wish it had either been a bit longer at least taken me a bit longer to read, considering the $15 cost of the e-book... But, I'll live... LOL I'm glad I read it myself before media coverage and reviews could sway my thinking more (not that I always give such things much weight).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Being Harry Potter is difficult enough, but being the son of the legendary wizard proves to be harder. Through this story, both Harry and his son learn that no one is perfect and that darkness never completely goes away. It can live in each of us.

This is the latest installment and sadly sounds like the last. I ordered it without hesitation and immediately started in on it, never setting it down. Finishing it within just a few hours, I was disappointed when it ended. Not because of the way it ended, but because the story was over. The whole story. Harry Potter was the series that got my daughter into reading. It's a series that I have read myself more than once....something I never do with a book no matter how good it is. I know there were a lot of people that were unhappy with it, but I wasn't one of them. Too many people I think were expecting another Harry Potter novel. It's not. You need to go in with an open mind and keep your expectations to a minimum. Was it perfect? No. Did it sometimes leave more questions than answers? Yes. But I enjoyed it anyway.

Even though this installment is in script form, it was just as enchanting as the others and managed to carry me away to another world. I'm not going to go into details about the story itself because I don't want to give anything away, but I was not the least bit disappointed. I can honestly say that if this is the end, I'm going to miss Harry and his friends and family. It's been a fun ride and one I wouldn't have missed for the world. Thank you J.K. Rowling, for giving us one final go around. It was worth the wait.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_187?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=187&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Because it's a screenplay, it's in script format and it has more jarring and sudden changes than a novel or movie. If you're comfortable with this style, it's a good story. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of a book or movie, it's very linear and has a single story line with only one or two very short side threads. A lot of people who I've heard complaints from sounded like they were judging this as the 8th Harry Potter novel rather than a screen play. It isn't.

I was a bit disappointed when I heard another book was coming out, for two reasons. One, because, I’m like ‘what could it be about? It had such a closing ending with the Dark Lord defeated.’ And the other reason was because it wasn’t in normal story form, but in the form of a play. And not everyone can understand what was going on. So, when I was given the book as a present, I was a bit hesitant about it. However, I was surprised on how well the book was. True, it was a bit off putting, how the book was written, like I figured it would be. However, I was able to catch onto what was happening rather quickly.

One issue I had with it, was that it was moving so fast. The other Harry Potter books only had everything happen in one year, but this book had quite a few years passing. I did like how Albus was a very ‘real’ character that everyone could relate to. He understood that he wasn’t going to be the perfect child, and he had siblings that he felt different from. His father was this famous person, and everyone in his family but him was put into the same house.

Overall, this book was good. I laughed, I cried, and I also wanted to throw the book across the room. I felt that Delphi was a bad character, but I didn’t expect her to be Voldemort's daughter. That one threw me for a huge loop! And I did like how Harry was able to travel back to his infanthood, and help Albus when it was needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Nine years since my favorite book of all time came to an end. So the announcement of an eighth Harry Potter story seemed too good to be true. And finally, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" is here. It only took a day to read--partially because the play-format makes for a quick read, and partially due to my fevered excitement to see what the epic trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were up to now that Hogwarts is so many years behind them.

Without giving away too much of the plot, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" finds an adult Harry struggling to bond with his teenaged middle child, the most troubled of his three children, Albus Severus Potter. In turn, Albus struggles with living in his famous father's footsteps, as well as dealing with the complications surrounding his relationship with Scorpious Malfoy, the son of Harry's former school tormentor, Draco Malfoy. Most notably, however, is Albus' struggle to process the consequences some of Harry's school-day actions, and wondering if there is anything he can do to make up for his father's deeds. Though Harry and Albus at times seem as different as day and night, both are plagued with the unrelenting desire to ""right"" the ""wrongs"" they perceive, even if fate often has other things in store.

While the magic of the original seven books is somewhat lacking due to the story not being in the prose format that we Harry Potter fans are accustomed to, it was still a pretty good story. The overall theme is something that has been done plenty of times before, but seeing beloved characters work their way through it creates a feeling of nostalgia for the original HP tales. Also, much like the HP movies tended to pale in comparison to the rich stories created in the books--reading this, I got the impression that it paled in comparison to what the stage production must be like. I feel like the story likely resonates a lot more effectively in the format it is meant to be experienced in, and can only hope the play is taken ""on tour"" in the U.S. one day.

""Cursed Child"" doesn't quite go as deep and dark as some of the later Potter books, and overall, this story feels a lot more light-hearted, and even fan fiction-like at times. Regardless, it is still full of surprising revelations, despite some being easy to see coming. This book probably isn't the epic return of Harry Potter that fans have been waiting for, but it does satisfy the desire to return to Hogwarts one more time, and to get a ""check-in"" on the characters we grew to love so much during the Potter era.

So while this story does not live up to the seven Potter books before it, I think it is enough to put a smile on the face of true HP fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_191?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=191&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Price","This story is FUN and not as CURSED as it has been made out to be....","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2016","I read ALL of the reviews about this story, negative-neutral-positive. I think some may have read TOO much into this. Agree...this reads like fan fiction. That's not entirely a bad thing. The best part is...it's JK Rowling ENDORSED fan fiction. It is a story that, in my opinion, is not really needed, but didn't hurt anything in the franchise. I feel that way about Fantastic Beasts. The original book was a reference tool for the original stories. Now we have a screenplay and movie created out of that is thinly connected to Harry Potter using history. These stories are just fun. There are preposterous situations, characters and scenarios that are a HUGE stretch...but that's okay. I have my seven books that I get to re-invest in as often as I want. HPATCC is/was a quick read and a, kinda, nice ""Where are they Now"" story. The best part is...one them stayed from the original series...and that is the value of loyal, loving FRIENDSHIP. In the original 7, Fantastic Beasts screenplay and this story...it is universal throughout. In my book...that IS the best thing out of all of it. It is also why I gave it 4 stars. Lastly...there were comments about what Harry would/would not do. I would suggest re-reading ""Order of the Phoenix""... Harry was quite different in that book that ""Cursed Child"" had a deja vu feel to it...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Well, I was a little disappointed. It read like more of a fan-fiction novel than the original Harry Potter books, and I found it to be a little over the top in regards to its occasional cheesiness. Sometimes the dialogue of the characters didn't seem to fit the personality of the characters from the previous novels. In my opinion, the whole thing seemed a little bit rushed and forced.

I would love to see the play at some point, but unless they travel to a city near me, this is the closest I'm going to get. J.K. Rowling did not write this, it's based off a short story she may (?) have written by herself or with the play author, not totally clear on that one.

On to the review: I enjoyed this. I didn't LOVE it, like the originals, but I enjoyed getting a glimpse into the adult lives of HP characters. It's been awhile since I've read the books, so I could be wrong on this, but some of the characters seemed a bit off to me (probably due to them being written by a different person). That was really the only thing that bugged me.

W.","Probably most enjoyable in person","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2016","After finishing the screenplay so quickly, I figured I'd leave a review (especially after seeing all of the scathing hate notes people have left for it, sheesh). For me, it's hard to say how I feel about it, only that I don't think it's that bad. Like some have mentioned, it does have a bit of that HP spark from the books, though it's hard to feel engrossed in the world from a screenplay. I mean, think about A Very Potter Musical: Would it have been nearly as funny or as popular without being able to watch the live performances? I bet a lot of the comedy and even the heartwarming moments would fall flat if it had been only released as a screenplay. Bless Starkid for posting it for free on YouTube. Based on what I imagined from the stage directions and what descriptions were provided, I'll bet it would be really powerful to see live, with all of the acting and special effects, and I hope the show is successful enough to go on tour.

Note: Spoilers to follow, so continue reading at your own risk.
Again, SPOILERS BELOW.

---

What I said above doesn't excuse the problems with plot/characterization that I can't imagine feeling great about even with a live performance. So off goes a star because I can't reasonably give this 5 stars if I don't feel it's as amazing as 5 stars, you know? Certain screenplays deserve that; not this one.

So, I'll start with what I liked about reading it:
- Scorpius! Scorpius was lovely; he's my new favorite character and the source of some of my favorite lines/scenes. I hope his actor pulled them off as well as (or better than) I ""saw"" them in my head. I will go to my grave believing he's part of the LGBT community and no one can convince me otherwise. I love how horrified he was at the prospect that people thought he hated doing homework and reading books.
- Albus as a Slytherin: I need more positive Slytherin characters. Thank goodness we now have at least two more.
- Albus and Scorpius's friendship
- Draco's change of heart and the obvious love he has for his family; I've always admired that about the Malfoys and I'm glad it was touched upon here.
- The ambiance created by certain scenes, such as the Dementors and so on. I really wish I could see how these worked in person.
- Hermione's roles of power: She's still got it. Attawitch! Also her rebellious Alternate Universe.
- Athlete!Rose, though I wish we'd been able to see more of her/have more development of her personality. I kind of wanted her to team up with her cousin, but whatever. I like that she's into Quidditch and isn't all about books, which sets her apart from her mother.
- Dumbledore chiding Harry for Albus's name: Oh, the meta.
- Snape, Snape, Severus Snape
- Everything to do with the blanket tugged at the heartstrings (I only mind a little what had to happen to it in order to make the plot work.)
- The adult relationships (mostly): Harry and Ginny, Draco and Astoria, Ron and Hermione
- The Hagrid scene

What I disliked/felt uncomfortable with/was confused by:
- We have a time travel plot (oh the problems with time travel plots I can rant about) and we use it on Cedric? You know, I feel bad for him and all, but I would think Albus would feel more strongly about maybe Teddy Lupin's parents? Or Fred? I mean, I disagree with him trying to save anyone, but I'd understand him trying to do it for them. Why use it on Cedric when the fourth book is so much more effective as is (which this play spent the whole time establishing?).
- Bellamort is canon. Wut. So much DO NOT WANT with that visual. I guess in a way it makes sense, but I kind of hoped the Cursed Child would have more of a complex arc than a typical ""I'm evil because of my Fatherlord"" shtick. (Didn't Draco or his family notice Bella was pregnant during the books? Seems like a really obvious thing that would be hard for her to hide.) I liked Delphie as a character better when she seemed interested in saving a life. Though I thought the twist at the end made it a little better. I felt horrible for Harry sticking through all of it; our poor hero has had enough trauma, don't you think?
- Harry wanted to end a friendship on really stupid assumptions that I thought he'd resolved by the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. What the hell, Harry's characterization. Does he not remember Snape and Lily's friendship? At least nearly every other character called him out on it.
- Oh yeah, we're casually having a Blood Ball for Voldemort Day with Muggleborn screams emanating from the dungeons.
- I wanted to know more about Craig Jr. RIP dude, we barely knew ya.
- I don't buy the bit about Parseltongue at all. I wish it hadn't been necessary for the plot because the books tied that loose end up so neatly and it feels all unraveled again.
- You refer to Neville and never show him (or his family) once? Boo.
- The Trolley Lady, holy hell
- I wouldn't have minded Ron being a bit more serious, since he seemed more like comedy relief from his dialogue/mannerisms.
- Um, I'm not the only one who was stuck with feeling like Albus/Ron kissing and flirting with Hermione was both hilarious and incredibly weird, right? I'm not mad about it, just incredibly uncomfortable. Again with the whole Albus and Delphie thing, too.

But yeah, I did feel a bit of the Harry Potter magic come back while I read it, and for that I don't regret reading it. It's got a flawed plot and I don't agree with how they portrayed all of the characters, but it was entertaining enough for a few hours. I can't really trash it when there's so much missing when you haven't seen it live.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_202?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=202&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But due to so many others ignoring it, I join the majority.

As for the most here I am also a huge Potter-maniac, reading the books over and over again, and new stuff is always a big deal for us.
I assume most negative-rated comments are led by too big expectations according to this short story.
Whats more, I don't want to SPOIL many things, so I try to focus on the main plot: the time travelling.
Yeah, that's worth discussing it. I have to admit it's somehow not the best inventive approach for bookwriters, especially for Harry Potter franchise, which thousands of fanfictions are covered with hypothetic mindgames based on time travelling.
Then, bringing back the ultimative evil in form of Voldemort's (one SPOILER more) unknown daughter, wasn't necessary at all.

But hell, that are the only things I really can complain about. After 9 years of waiting for new stuff I am very pleased with this little e-book.
I was aware all the time that The Cursed Child would never be as good as the book series. Never. Thus my expectation was very low, and that's why I am very happy now since it's doubtless no bad creation considering it is in fact a theatre play.

So I would suggest frustrated fans to calm down a bit and then think about it again later.
As for me, I'm looking forward to new books in the future, real books which can't be read in several hours.
Having in mind, that time travelling is gone as a plot from now on is a great thing to hope for future projects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_205?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=205&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"". (Parts One and Two). Rehearsal Edition

Being a skeptic about sequels I ordered this book mainly because I am a closet Harry Potter ""groupie"".  Yes, I read the books in my 50's and have ""Pottermore"" on my computer favorites!

Besides being a ""sequel"" the book is presented in script form, written as a read through and directive for scene settings of a play.  How can any of those things compare to the addicting words and characters of J.K. Rowling?

Well, it hit the mark for my unquenchable thirst for continuing the saga of Hogworts and it's favored alumni.  I felt an immediate connection to Harry's, Hermione's and Draco Malfoy's children.  The story of Albus and Scorpius had a more contemporary feel but I loved the fact that the old favorites were included and given some closure.  It took no more than a chapter to adjust to the literary structure and from there my mind assimilated the words easily and went into picture mode.  I loved the story and the characters and felt a seamless continuation of the original series.

My only lingering thought is:  ""How will this go over as a live stage presentation?""  A movie?  Sure.  But a live stage may be a difficult venue to keep the drama and electric charge alive without the special effects.  Although I will be in line for a ticket if it comes to a venue near me!

You immediately see Rowling's engaging writing and development of the new characters.  I am sure Thorne and Tiffany made the way easy for adaptation to play format.  Their biographies show their success in that venue.  All should be proud of this addition to the Potter family of books!  HP fans...definitely pick this up!

I did enjoy the story of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  Yes, I had heard about this book being a script, but I was still surprised by the format.  However, we the fans deserved a book.  The characters Al, Scorpius, Rose deserved a book and the plot, especially of the children and their time at Hogwarts deserved to be a well thought out and written book.  J.K. Rowling owes us a book.  I also liked reading about Harry, Ron and Hermoine as grown ups and their alter universe as well.  Draco too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It was different, in that it was a play format instead of novel, but still delightful.  If anything, I wish it could have been a full fledged novel which gives you so much more detail and lets you be with the characters longer.  I just love the second generation of Hogwarts students.  A great read.

Plays are a lot different to read than books. Minimal description and often little direction. Shakespeare, it seems only managed one memorable one, ""Exit, pursued by bear"", but this actually reads really easily and well and at the end I really felt like I'd read a new chapter, even though it's in this form and would clearly be better seen on stage.

It is not another fully fleshed out volume from J.K. It is a rehearsal script for a stage play.

Reading it can be difficult, although I quickly adapted and was able to immerse myself into the story.  Yes, the action moves very quickly and relies heavily on familiarity with the series for comprehension. There are a few plot holes that will enable die-hard PotterHeads to nitpick ad-nauseum, but overall the narrative stands as an acceptable addition to the series.  I won't harp on the shortcomings because they are far outweighed by the good exemplified by the relationship development between fathers, sons, and friends.  Harry and Draco find commonality as loving fathers that are having relationship difficulties with their sons who are best friends.  As stated, I can't wait to see this on stage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Love you amazon!

I just finished reading it, and it's really good, though I can't see it as the ""official eighth book"". For me, it's a really well written fanfiction. I can tell JK Rowling was not responsible for the actual writing, because at times the characters are a bit ott and not quite canon. They don't always sound like the Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the book. And Draco Malfoy is far too cheerful and friendly with the trio (even calling them by their first names). Professional McGonagall is also way out of character. The ending was kind of rushed and also too good to be true (everything fell into place all at once), but otherwise it was a cute, funny and heartwarming read. Like I said, it's a really well written fanficition, but definitely not the eighth Harry Potter book!

I would recommend this to any Harry Potter fan, but don't read it with too many expectations! The storyline is definitely not as complex as the Harry Potter series, but if you're looking for a light, enjoyable read to pass time, then you'll like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I think, looking at the negative reviews on here, that people are failing to look at this as it's own separate entity. And I hate to break it to you, but humans do in fact CHANGE as they age. Everyone is saying ""Harry would NEVER do this. Ron would NEVER do this. etc etc"". First off, it's two decades down the road. Harry could've reasonably turned into a violent alcoholic with a foot fetish. It happens. That's life. Also, this IS NOT a Harry Potter book. It's a script based off of a play that was the product of three different people. Also, it's a script. It will NOT read the same ""intricate"" way as a book nor will it have the same feel.

As a stand alone story, I enjoyed it. Harry and the other characters are essentially just grappling with the normal things middle aged people do, just with a magical twist. There's a humanizing aspect to it. And while I absolutely loathed Albus as a character, I still enjoyed it. It was overpriced, definitely. But if I think of it just as a Harry Potter side piece, it's enjoyable and a good read. But no, it's not another installment in the series. And I'm honestly baffled at how many people seemed to miss that memo, even after Rowling herself stated it pre-release. Regardless, it's enjoyable unless you're a Harry Potter snob and have absurd expectations. 3.5/5","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Pretend this is a fan fiction and you won't be disappointed.

I loved learning about Album,  Scorpius, Draco,  the relationship between Harry and others, and the touching sentiments before imminent death; I adored those aspects. For that alone I enjoyed this script.
The reason I say pretend it's afan fiction is because I'm sorry JK  Rowlings but you wrote such a tight series to start with that people know your characters as well as you.  Voldemort quite simply would not have a child.  He wouldn't.  He didn't love and obviously sex can occur without love but he didn't want an equal.  There is no way he'd have risked a child. Throughout his entire life needed to be the only special one. The only heir of Slytherin.  He killed his father for crying out loud. Family meant nothing to him. Power,  for himself alone,  and self sufficiency was all he cared about. He was not getting freaky with Bellatrix. Nooope,  he'd have created another horcrux first.  Then there is the issue of time turners, say one did survive,  it's sort of a lame way out.  This isn't Back to the Future and no one wants it to be. I'd have preferred this to be some sort of what if dream/spell than actual time travel.  I get that I'm an adult reading about a faux magical world but I guess time trave of this magnitude is just a bit much for me. That's why it feels fan fiction.

But again going back to the characters was awesome.  Ron,  always my favorite, remained my favorite.  Draco was perfect.  Great to hear their voices again. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy hanging out with the characters we grew up with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_193?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=193&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

And I'd love to see it made into a movie (or two) someday so that it could be fleshed out more.  But at the end of the day, JK Rowling wasn't looking to launch a next generation series, and the entire project was conceived start to finish as a play.  And as a play, it actually works very well.

I have been fortunate over the years to see many stage productions, and reading some of the negative reviews, many of them feel like either the reviewer is not as familiar with how plays differ from books and movies, or they just didn't want it done as a play in the first place.  A script for a play is really only a piece of the finished production, so in order to appreciate HPCC, it's important to visualize the actors, costumes, sets, lighting, the orchestra...in other words, visualize a play.  It's not a movie, it's not a novel, and this script never will be without an adaptation and expansion.  Plays do move through time at a rate that feels different, they do throw brief vignettes at you to get you between the bigger scenes.  It's just the nature of the medium, so criticisms like that are more to do with plays in general.

As far as the story goes, I don't disagree that it's less meaty and complex than the HP books.  I don't disagree that recycling material from the books is not as good as a full ""next generation"" novel fleshed out with it's own stories and feel would have been.  Which is why I agree with some reviewers who call this an epilogue, an extension of the last chapter of HPDH.  So what's the point of this play?  What is it's raison d'etre?  In a word, the characters.

Once you accept this work as a play and an epilogue, it becomes a vehicle to see what life after Voldemort looks like for these characters and how they are all affected by what came before.  And in that sense, it does have the complexity that some claim is missing...but it's a complexity of characters and relationships rather than a complexity of story.

SPOILERS--READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK/SCRIPT.

There are some great elements in this play.  Albus getting sorted into Slytherin, Scorpius and Albus becoming best friends, just about every word Scorpius says, and the strained relationship between Harry and his son.  Now, a very frequent criticism I've seen is that ""Harry Potter would never say he wished Albus wasn't his son!  He'd never sacrifice time with his family for work!""  And yet, these are the same struggles that every parent faces, so those moments actually made the story feel more real and relatable.  Watching Harry try to have a reasonable discussion with Albus, only to lose his temper and say something he regrets when Albus pushes his buttons...that happens to good parents, and it's not like Harry doesn't have a history of losing his temper!  But his moral center immediately brings the realization of his mistake and the attempt to fix it.  That's the whole point of this play.  It's not happily ever after...it's life, and life is messy, and Harry is not infallible (and he never has been, which is what makes him interesting).

Slytherin is still Slytherin.  Some critics seem to think the events of HPDH would have redeemed the house, but the reality is that the noble acts of some house members just aren't enough for the world in general to automatically embrace the house that produced every Death Eater.  In truth, the real criticism should be at the books for having so few non-Slytherin baddies (Peter Pettigrew notwithstanding).  It would be nice to live in a more forgiving world, but sadly, this aspect is also realistic, and as long as Slytherins are expected to act like Death Eaters, they will likely live up to their reputation.

The Cedric situation does suffer from not having enough of an opportunity to breathe. If the source of the prophecy was covered, if it was better established as the reason these events are unfolding in the first place, it would have felt better...but again, play vs. book.  But Cedric turning bad isn't as crazy a stretch as some might think.  Someone once said to me, ""I don't think you can truly hate unless you've loved.""  Yes, Cedric is honorable...and popular and handsome and universally loved.  So take all that away from him and is it so hard to imagine a slow spiral into darkness?  People never want to believe this can happen, and are always surprised when it does.

A weak point that would benefit from a meatier adaptation is how Delphi engages Albus in her plot.  It comes across as lucky coincidence instead of an expertly manipulated series of events.  But it wouldn't take too much to fix this for a movie adaptation.

Finally, there's the widespread disappointment that Albus and Scorpius aren't gay.  If anything, the trend of inserting gay characters into every franchise lately has started to feel like token attempts to seem progressive in many cases.  The fact that a character is heterosexual shouldn't be any more relevant than being homosexual.  They're just people.  But, if it makes everyone feel better, maybe they're both bisexual and afraid of ruining their friendship by changing its nature...and it just happened to be a girl that is Scorpius's second choice.

So yes, time turners and tournaments and prophecies and offspring of villains aren't the most inventive or original story mechanisms that could have been explored.  And yes, reading a play will always be less satisfying than reading a book or seeing a movie or seeing the fully produced play performed.  But taken for what this is (a character study rooted in real life relationship challenges set as an epilogue to a beloved series of books), Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is what it is...and that's not a bad thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Cano","I eagerly suck up any additional stories or writings I can from ...","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2016","I feel I must start this review by saying that I am a die hard Harry Potter fan. I have all the books on audio and listen to them on repeat on a daily basis. They are my ""background noise"" or ""white noise"". I can quote whole sections at a time with Jim Dale as he reads it. I eagerly suck up any additional stories or writings I can from JK about the wizarding world and for that reason alone I love the play. With that being said, I am disappointed by the obvious lack of JK's skill in this play. It is obvious that it was written by someone else and only approved by her. There is a lack of detail in the storyline and more flat out bashing you over the head with information. The story also seemed rushed as compared to the books. This might be because it was meant to be enjoyed as a play and not as a book, but I found it to be a little disappointing. From this point on I warn you of spoilers!!!

SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT
SPOILER ALERT

The story picks up at platform 9 3/4  19 years later. Already I am annoyed that some lines are spoken by the wrong characters, but maybe I am the only one that picks up on that.  Albus becomes best friends with Scorpius, Scorpius and Albus become best friend, Albus and Scorpius are attached at the hip, inseparable friends... We get it. They bash you over the head with it. Unlike JK, who let's you discover character development through character behavior, these guys flat out tell you over and over and over again. I found it a little insulting, but maybe it comes across different in the play. I hated the lady that pushes the trolley. They changed her from a human witch into some strange bogart like morphing monster. It seemed out of line for the wizarding world and rather uninventive. I find it more likely that there is a spell or barrier that keeps the students on the train and not a monster cart lady that is as old as time.

I did like hearing about where Harry, Ron and Hermione are now. I find it perfectly natural that Ron is a huge jokester now. We all knew that he took over Fred's spot in the joke shop and with his wife being in a serious position like the minister of magic, it makes sense that he would balance out the relationship by being over the top funny. I also liked the way they portrayed Ginny and Harry's relationship. Ginny always did seem more insightful than Harry so when he flies off the handle at Albus it seems natural that she would comfort him and be able to reassure him that Al will forgive him.

I always thought there was something between Bellatrix and the Dark Lord so to hear they had a daughter seems entirely natural. There is easily enough time between when we see them at the beginning of book 7 (July so probably already pregnant but not showing) and when the snatchers bring Harry to the Malfoy’s for her to have had a baby.

Clark","Not the Novels, but Still Fun for HP Fans","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2016","4/4.5 stars.

I had very mixed feelings about how to review this.  I'm a huge HP fan, and so reading this was of course super-exciting for me, and I did really enjoy it.  At the same time, it was clear to me that reading a play script is not the same as reading one of the novels.  I've heard great things about the play and by reading the script it sounded amazing; however, the script in and of itself, while interesting, was a less fabulous experience than reading the books.

Of particular interest to me as a writer was the fact that the script, by leaving out (as scripts do) all the ""slow"" stuff that fills up novels, was a less rewarding reading experience.  Scripts by their nature can't have any internal monologue or reflection: everything has to be said out loud, or portrayed by the actors' physical movements on stage/screen.  Scripts also have very minimal descriptions of settings and background, and the action is by necessity compressed.  The result is something very spare--I finished the entire thing in a couple of hours--that is more like a sketch than a book.  It's a book in which the author has taken the common command these days to ""tighten up your writing"" and ""cut filler"" to its maximum possible expression, and the result is something that is not really a book.  All the empty space on the page between is just...empty space on the page, lacking the depth that the novelistic form provides.  Which is not to say that this is bad, per se, it just highlighted for me the unique benefits of the novel, which allows for a depth and introspection that other forms do not.

All that being said, Harry Potter fans like me are probably going to enjoy this.  Aside from the genre differences, reading it was more like a cruise through a greatest hits album with the occasional original track thrown in than a fully-fledged new book, but a lot of the old magic is still there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_198?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=198&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I finished reading this snappy read about an hour ago. I haven't really read any reviews of it, other than some of taglines like ""So many twists!"" There are no more twists to this story than any other Potter story. Perhaps the cruelest twist, then, is in expecting readers who have never read a play to hope it reaches them as emotionally as the first seven stories did.

Without the narrative and inner voice to accompany what is little more than dialogue and stage direction, the authors are forced into weaving slight contrivances into the dialogue to help shepherd the reader into understanding the motivation behind any given character in any given scene. In the end, it works, but I wonder how many readers get that far without becoming frustrated.

The story centers around Albus Severus Potter - remember reading that name in 'Deathly Hallows' and almost being moved to tears at the significance behind it?  It seems that Albus isn't all that interested in what made mom and dad name him that; in fact, his priority appears to be in coming to grips with being the son of Harry Potter.  Another of the main characters is a kid named Scorpius Malfoy - who also seems to be having issues living up to his own father's best wishes.  Through a series of encounters, and early on in the story, we learn that Albus and Scorpius, who somehow have found themselves to be kindred spirits, are contriving to step back into the past with a Time Turner to right a wrong and make the world a better place.  It wouldn't be much of a story if they succeeded in doing just that, so there's all sorts of misunderstood actions and missteps along the way.  You don't have to read too many books on time travel to know that sometimes things can really go wrong with the slightest of actions.  A temporal butterfly effect.

In true Rowling fashion, things get off to a bang, and there's loss of life at stake (on a massive scale) depending on whether or not the Potter and Malfoy progeny can undo what's been done.  Of course they can't, not on their own.  And even then...

There are some minor complaints about the writing - at times, it seems as though this is a story wrapped up in a Trivial Pursuit game; many names from the past are re-introduced, as can be expected in any series that has run this long, but often we are met with obscure names that may have been mentioned once in an early chapter of an even earlier story in the set - and that's the only mention. Are the authors offering a nod to the true Potter geek? I didn't consider these moments as roadblocks, but they were certainly distracting and seemed to be shoe-horned into the text in as unwieldy a manner as could be expected.

The story was very good, everything a true Potter fan could have hoped for. Among the best-written parts in the play are the redemption and acknowledgment of past courageous acts for a number of well-known characters; this seemed to also be a nod to true devotees who may have felt certain characters' sacrifices, both known and assumed, went unappreciated for too long. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll leave that up to your imagination as to whom I'm writing about. Regardless, these passages could have been written in a ridiculously syrupy manner, and perhaps if this were a traditional novel, that would have been the case, but the stage is too swollen with action for characters or audience to dwell too much on them. The authors are, to paraphrase one exchange, planting acorns for the ride home and for the weeks to come.

One thing that stands out to the even mildly observant reader is that trying to stage this play as written would be a courageous endeavour. There are seemingly hundreds of scenes scattered through the acts, and the magic is deeply ingrained throughout - how certain actions could be translated to the stage are beyond me, but that's happily not my job. It does make me want to see the play in person, however.

What would be even more interesting would be to see how it could be brought to the cinema screen. It would be interesting to see it happen, but it would have to occur with at least one major change in the cast - Alan Rickman's passing would demand someone that could handle Snape's lines - not much of a spoiler, since it's already been revealed that the play involves a good deal of time travel.

So anyway, a good read, almost a must-read for the true Potter fans, with a gentle warning to approach with caution - remember it's not a novel, there is a good deal of reading between the lines required in order to follow along without getting too frustrated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Even though I enjoyed the book, I miss her Dickensian detail and sense of humor. It felt a little fan-fictionish because it lacks much of Rowling's humanistic and humorous voice.

This play make me appreciate the later books all the more. I miss Rowling's clever and intricate descriptions of weird and wonderful people, places, and things. Plays don't have time for that the way novels do.

Still, a quick summer read -- not something that you can say about most Harry Potter books.

Throughout, it leaves you asking: ""why would Harry's kid want to do such a thing?"", and it never supplies an answer. To show daddy up? To declare independence? To....what?

""To crate phony TV episode like drama"" is all I can think of. So much of it revolves around going into the past...with no valid reason for doing so. Still, what there is is well written, and interesting. I don't regret having made the purchase, or spent the time to read it, but it did not cost a lot, either, and it was short.

Mischief Managed.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","For a play, I thought this was a worthy edition to the Potter canon. But it’s not great like the books and it’s not written by J.K.Rowling, so it shouldn’t be judged as such. The epilogue of The Deathly Hallows serves as the jumping off point to the story. What could be more appropriate and welcome?  The adventure centers around Albus, the estranged son of Harry, and Scorpius Malfoy who, after both are sorted into Slytherin, become close friends. In a misbegotten effort to prevent the death of Cedric Diggory, by the use of a forbidden and illegal time turner, they rain down disaster and darkness on the Wizarding World and their own families.  Lots of scenes from the original 7 books are revisited and we are treated to some alternate realities in which, for one, <spoiler>Ron and Hermione never fall in love and get married and Harry Potter is killed by Voldemort. </spoiler>It’s not nice to try to change history.  It has somewhat of an “It’s a Wonderful Life” vibe in places.  Some of the ways the boys unintentionally change history are overly fanciful and fan fictiony, but the script fits in. Potterheads  should not be outraged, and I was not disappointed. There are lots of cameo appearances by many beloved and hated characters from the books and movies, and I believe it when I read what a crowd and critic pleaser the actual West end play is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

For those of us (us Harry Potter fans) who actually kept up with this play knew exactly what we were buying. I am very pleased with the story. It was entertaining. I could not put it down. I love that it is a play. In a world that prizes itself on books turning into movies, it is quite refreshing to have a wonderful story turn into a play. I docked a star because I do agree with most of the readers, the characters were flat at times and didn't resemble what I know of them. Since the story is all about Harry and Albus's relationship, I think the ending was unfulfilling and unresolved.

However he bought me the hardback copy (which I would have told him is the version I wanted had he asked, but he surprised me). Yet reading a physical copy of a book is just about impossible for me right now. What reading I do is mostly done on my phone a page here and there throughout my day, 15 minutes here while nursing the baby, and another 15 there before bed. And that's why I put off reading this book for so long. I actually ended up borrowing this from the elibrary just so that I could read it on my phone. And it feels good to have finally read this finale.

I didn't have high expectations for this continuation. That's mostly because I always worry that a series that has ended doesn't always need to be revisited (even the ones I loved the most). Sometimes the original ending is where things need to stay and let our imaginations fill in the rest. So I just went in with low expectations and that being said I really ended up enjoying Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

The old gang was much more involved in the story than I originally expected. While I assumed they would be present in the parental nature, I didn't expect the roles to be as prominent as they were. The story is as much about Harry's relationship with his son Albus as it is anything else. I enjoyed the fan service included throughout. I was pleasantly surprised with Draco's role and how much his character has changed since we last saw him. While I did enjoy this change if I'm being honest it is hard for me to imagine him this far changed from who we're used to seeing. In the same way I was surprised with how much of a role the old gang had in the story, I was also surprised with how little of a role Harry's other kids (James and Lily) and even Ron and Hermione's kids had.

Albus and Scorpius form the other main section of story. It isn't easy being the son of Harry Potter. Nor the son of Draco Malfoy. These two bond over their lack of other friends. I was quite concerned that the writers were going to turn the friendship between these two boys into more but I'm so glad that wasn't the case. They do have a bit of a David and Johnathan kind of closeness between them which I really appreciated seeing. I love stories about deep friendship.

I was also unsure about the villian of this story. Because this is a single story, the writers didn't have time to build up an evil to rival Voldemort who was complex and slowly revealed over the course of seven books. I didn't want old V to be the villian of this story also considering everything our characters did to defeat him in the original 7 books. I was happy with how things worked out even if they weren't completely unpredictable.

The most important part ofHarry Potter and the Cursed Child was the father/son relationship between Harry and Albus for me. There were parts that had me concerned about the direction of this story and the characters but in the end I was happy with how all the pieces played out. Throughout the majority of the book I was thinking I'd probably only give this 3 Stars, but the ending brought it up to 4 Stars for me. Have you read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child?

I'm sure it's something to behold in person.

It came across to me, however, that some of the dialogue points were laid on thick (Dumbledore's painting is highly emotional, which doesn't fit into D's character at all).

It was also disappointing to see Hermoine, Ron and Ginny diluted to caricatures of their more nuanced characters.

It seems the playwright ignored the less is more approach in favor of over explaining certain emotional motifs in some misguided attempt at tapping the HP nostalgia cash cow.

I will say, Harry is well-rounded and makes for a somewhat-touching emotional arc in this play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I would recommend this for all ages that wants to hear about the adventures and misadventures of Harry's son and unlikely friend. You will also learn the fate of our beloved characters and what could happen if you play with time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_119?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=119&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

A must-have for Potter fans:","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2016","Excellent play! No, it's not quite the same as reading the original series, but it's a really well-done supplement to them. The story draws you in pretty quickly and you definitely get emotionally invested in the characters. Will it be your absolute favorite? Probably not, but it's definitely worth the read.
Pros:
- New characters are incorporated into the HP universe pretty seamlessly.
- All events, locations, etc. are accurate to the original books. No changes/liberties taken to ""make it work"" with a new story.
- Modified perspective! While Harry plays a very large part in the story, he's not the main character and he's not always seen in a favorable light.
- While being a continuation or sequel, this play deals with a lot of characters and events from the original series. The events of the past play a central role in the current plot and important characters from the originals add depth or at least thoughts/opinions that weren't given the first time around or, better still, given in retrospect.
- Now that it's been 19 years since the events of the originals, some of the characters reflect on actions and circumstances of the past. It adds a new perspective because not all of them like who they were back then, nor think their actions were the best option. Hindsight's always 20/20, right?
- The physical book is great quality, comfortable holding while reading, and looks fantastic on the shelf with its predecessors.

Cons:
- This is a one-sitting read. Short and straight to the point. The plot flies by pretty quickly without lingering much on details.
- The style, being a play, leaves a lot to be desired as far as what characters may be thinking as opposed to what they are saying. Everything you know and learn and understand comes from dialogue only. Of course this is the nature of a play, but when you're accustomed to full novelization (as we Potter fans are) it's a bit lacking in unspoken emotion and imagery.
- One of the ""pros"" above was that this is a sequel that ties-in well with its predecessors. That is true, but there are moments while reading that feel almost TOO tied-in. That's to say that it feels forced sometimes; like certain people or events, etc. were put in there purely to have something recognizable in a new story.
- While J.K. Rowling undoubtedly had a large part in creating the story/plot, you can definitely tell that she didn't pen the words herself. That's not to say it isn't well-written (because it is), but there are subtleties, word choices, phrasings, etc. that show another writer's imprint. You may not even notice these subtleties at first, but the overall ""feel"" is different. Again: different does not mean bad.

All in all, I'm glad I've got this play in my Potter collection and it was an enjoyable read. I recommend it to anyone who has read the complete series and is itching for more. I don't, however, recommend it to a ""casual"" fan - a.k.a. someone who has not read the entire series or who was never that emotionally invested in the story. This play relies very heavily on the assumption that you know all the details of the original series off the top of your head. Without that knowledge, a lot of the actions/events/etc. wouldn't make much sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Albus Potter is a wonderful character, as is Scorpio Malfoy, and the ways these characters echo and also change the stories of their parents is a delight.

In ways that I don't want to spoil it does revisit old territory, which is not what I expected. But the choices that lead to those moments are very strong. This is a story about children dealing with living in the shadow of their parents' histories (and their parents struggling to deal with the same thing). It's rich terrain.

I suspect some readers will find certain big character moments towards the end a little less satisfying, in large part because this is not a book, where everything gets spelled out on the page, but a script. There's a lot of magic in these pages, but there's undoubtedly far more on the stage.

With the publication of the script Rowling announced she doesn't expect to return to the story of Harry Potter again. While I understand her decision, I hope she'll consider more stories about Albus, Scorpio (and also Delphi, Rose, James, Lily and all the rest). She and her co-writers have added a lot of interesting toys in this latter-day wizard world that we barely get to play with.

Last note -- loved every Ron moment. He's only gotten more fun as a character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Her name is on the cover because the study uses her characters (which she created in the original series). This is not an ""8th Harry Potter book"" and does not compare to the original series. It is, however a simple and fun reading experience. Judge it for what it is not for what it isn't. It is not a jk Rowling book.

(The Review)

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a fun and funny romp through several years and situations in the Potter-verse. Follow Harry and Albus, and Draco and Scorpius, as they try to navigate the post-Voldemort world while trying to establish relationships with each other. Fathers struggle to let go their pasts and accept their sons as they are, while sons of the famous and infamous alike struggle to find their footing and make their own identities in this world. While the dialogue-heavy script book lacks much of the detail, emotion, and magic that J.K. Rowling effortlessly captured in the original series, Cursed Child will still be a must-read for Potter fans everywhere, who have waited more anxiously for a return to this world than for their Hogwarts Letter all those years ago. For fans, this story will satisfy those who have missed these characters these past 9 years, and who wish to check in with them and see what they are up to. Those looking for a true ""8th book"" will be disappointed in this script book, but those looking for a simple continuation of the world will find enjoyment in what is offered herein.

Final thought: I enjoyed the ability to return to this world that so truly touched and shaped my life enough to overlook the weaker aspects of the script book!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_197?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=197&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling herself, but Harry Potter and the Cursed Child does feel as part of the same universe. The story takes some of the establishes characters to unlikely and interesting places, and the new ones, including Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, are well developed and likable. The interesting part, though, is in the play's presentation; the text DOES have many moments that left wondering exactly how the hell they are supposed to solve them on stage. Reviews saying the play is awesome and complex definitely aren't kidding.
The play does turn very expository from time to time, and dialogue isn't always the best, but as a brand new adventure with both familiar and new characters, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child works reasonably well. It's addictive, entertaining and somewhat predictable--can't wait to read the final text (this is a rehearsal version) and, god willing, to watch the actual play someday!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It pulled me in so quickly that I read it in one sitting. While it doesn't equate to the in-depth delight of reading the previous 7 books, anyone who likes Harry Potter should read this book.

It's hindered, of course, by it's format. It's a script, and so much of the magic of the novels is missing. Being limited to dialogue and stage direction means that this story, while enchanting, lacks the full bodied delight of the novels. The setting descriptions are very sparse, we don't truly ""see"" the characters, and without being able to watch the actors on stage, we miss the nuances that would be given to us through introspection and narration.

However, I truly loved this glimpse into the future of our beloved Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron. Seeing them navigate adult responsibilities and parenthood is a lot of fun. And the glimpses of other beloved characters (McGonagall, Draco, etc.) was like finding out that while yes, you did indeed already eat the whole cake, there was still a bit of frosting left over to enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry Potter and The Cursed Child - the most awaited book play script of the year, is storming the book world (2 million copies sold in the first 2days) and is making fans around the world giddy with excitement to be finally reading a new Harry Potter book.

Needless to say, I was no exception. Which is why, before I started reading this book, I tried to keep my expectations on a realistic level (tried is the operative word here), especially considering J.K.Rowling hadn't written this one.

Though I must say, that I was also a little nervous, because this series was magical perfection in my eyes, and I couldn't imagine how this play script could top that. In fact, without Rowling, I was sure of this being a step down; which is probably why, I am not as disappointed with it as many of the others are.

What is Harry Potter and The Cursed Child all about?

It's marketed as the 8th Harry Potter book, and that, I must say, is only partly accurate. Or at-least it depends on one's perception.

It's very much a continuation of the original story. In fact, it starts right where the epilogue ends - with Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermoine dropping off their kids at Platform 9 and 3/4. So, in that sense, yes, it's the 8th story.

But there is also a disconnect, which makes it unfair to call this the 8th of the Harry Potter series. It doesn't have the multi-faceted narrative, the strong characterization; and while it puts a grin on your face, it's incapable of evoking the depth of feeling the earlier books were able to arouse with ease.

Of-course most of this is because it's a play-script. And not a book. Which is why, I am not taking any points off for this.

I am only mentioning this, in the hopes that people keep this in mind, as they start reading the book. Because I have read too many negative reviews of this book, on the grounds that it is a play script. I mean, it's written right on the cover. What part of that was not clear?

Yes, I wished for this to be a book. And I wished that it would have been written by Rowling. But it's a play script, and I am not going to judge a thing adversely because it was something that it expressly claimed to be.

Of-course, being a play script doesn't excuse every thing (and I will get to those things later in the post).

This was the biggest plus for me.

A word of caution for other readers is to remember that this is a script. It isn't as detailed or character driven as the books themselves because it is meant to be performed. And as a piece that is meant to be performed I felt that it was well done. I would enjoy seeing the characters make this come to life.

There were somethings that I did not like in terms of the story - but I felt that the money that I paid for the book was worth it - especially to have the ability to be placed back in the Universe of Harry Potter. It was also nice to have a real closing to the story more than the chapter at the end of the 7th book.

Overall enjoyed the play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm one of those people who firmly believes in waiting to see the end result; I try my very best not to board the hype train or the hate train.  And then, they announced that this play, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" would be published in a book form so that all the people who cannot see the play could still experience it.

After waiting and the play's premiere, the book was finally released.  The conses seems to be on the negative side.  Everything ranging from mixed to negative all the way to the extremes of panned by critics and audiences.

And I just don't get it.  I finally picked up the book and read it, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A lot of the flack seems to be towards the format.  ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" is not actually a book...it's a published version of the script for the play.  A lot of reviews I saw when it came out were slamming the book for this.  Honestly, I think it's unfair.  The people who were anticipating and following the news of the release of this book should have seen it coming.  The articles I read explicitly stated this was the play's script in script format (as opposed to book format).  The negative reviews I've seen make it sound like the reviewers had no idea this was gonna happen.

Aside from that, the other reviews focus on the story's content.  I will admit, as much as I liked it, it wasn't perfect.  But, then again, it is a (spoilers) time travel story, and those are seldom perfect.  But I liked the plot and I liked the characters.  Yes, a lot of people complained that some characters (such as George Weasley and Neville Longbottom respectively) do not show up.  In my opinion, that's for the best.  Cramming as much of these characters as possible would have been merely fan service; they don't serve a purpose to the plot and thus weren't needed.

I will admit, I did have my issues at times.  My biggest being was that I felt Harry was acting extremely out of character at the beginning.  It was a little jarring at first to see him act so... un-Harry-like.  But, we have to remind ourselves, ""this is Harry 20 odd years later.""  Of course, in 20 plus years, a person is going to change.

Albus and Scorpius were my favorite characters in they book.  They developed nicely over the story as they struggled to find their identities living outside of their fathers' shadows.  I also liked the relationship between Albus and Harry.  You can see their struggle to understand and bond with each other and you can't help but feel for them.

There were other issues.  I felt some moments were rushed, especially in the beginning (it jumps from Albus Severus' 1st year to his 4th in like 10 minutes).  But overall, I really liked the story.

All I'm saying is, don't let the seemingly overwhelming sea of negativity dissuade you.  If you're curious, then read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_145?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=145&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I’m not a fan of the Harry Potter series. Having read it long ago, I thought it overblown and seriously lacking in imagination. Witches, wizards, giants, werewolves, vampires, unicorns, dragons, invisibility cloaks, flying broomsticks…none of these things were NEW. I’ve read about all of them elsewhere and often in greater depth.

But this book reminds me why J.K. Rowling’s magical novels resonate with so many of her readers. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer when the series was truly great, it was never just about the magic or the monsters. It was about people, their nature, characters and the way they react when confronted with problems and life choices. Even written as a play, that’s what comes through in this startling script.

Harry’s struggling with adulthood, fatherhood and the threat of Voldemort coming back. As always Ms. Rowling surprises, taking the story in unexpected directions. We meet old characters and new, dicey situations, read about risky behavior and monumentally stupid decisions. Hey, what’s life without idiotic choices and awful consequences?

After this, I think I’ll re-read the original series. You can’t go home again. But maybe you can re-assess some of your old opinions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Scorpius was adorable, and the friendship formed was heartwarming.

When they announced they were going to release the rehearsal script, I was happy, but didn’t plan to buy it right away.  I should know me better than that.  Yep, I caved and bought Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the week it came out.

If you aren’t yet familiar with the world of Harry Potter thanks to the wildly successful novels and equally wildly successful movies, then this book isn’t for you.  It assumes you know the backstory to what happens here, and if you don’t, you will be positively lost.  There are references to events and cameos by characters from the past books.  However, if you are already a fan, you’ll love diving into the latest story.

What is most notable about this book is that it is a bound copy of the rehearsal script for the play.  That means it reads very differently than a novel.  Essentially, it gives us dialogue and minimal stage direction and even less description.  It’s a different type of read, and you need to be in the proper mindset going into the book as a result.

The play actually opens with a scene we are already familiar with - the epilogue of the final novel.  In it, we see an adult Harry Potter sending his middle child off to his first year at Hogwarts.  From there, we see Albus Severus Potter landing in the unlikeliest house in the school and making a surprising best friend.  We breeze through a few scenes before really landing on the heart of the story, which involves time travel, alternative realities, and a chance to save an innocent from dying.  But when things go wrong, can Albus Potter undo what he has done?  Can Harry Potter work with his son to save the day?

I’ve seen some fans complain about this book being glorified fan fiction, and I can see their complaints.  The plot seems a little wacky overall, not the carefully thought out books in the series.  Yet, every time I started to feel that way, the characters pulled me back into the story and I forgot my complaints.  If you know and love these characters, it’s hard to not cheer for them.  I still feel like the basic premise of the story doesn’t sit completely right, but I don’t mind so much.

And that’s because I love the core cast of characters, and it was great to see them again.  I’m not sure I bought Ron’s personality in the story, but that’s my only real quibble with the characters.  There was a surprise ally along the way, and I loved seeing that relationship develop.  There were some truly touching moments as well.  Many of them were predictable, but that didn’t make them any less touching.

Those used to the immersive world of the Harry Potter novels will definitely miss that here.  Once again, we are reading a play, which is mostly dialogue.  The details of Harry’s world aren’t here because we would see that on stage.

And maybe that’s part of the reason I always had a hard time getting truly into the world like I would the books.  I kept picturing actors on a stage as events unfolded.  And the short scenes always made me think of how the scenes would change for an audience.  I tried to picture how they’d do the magic on stage as well.  That was distracting, although it is a personal issue.

The book is only 300 pages, so shorter than most of the novels.  Couple that with lots of white space because this is a script, and you have a very fast read.  Again, I think this helps explain some of the complaints from fans.

While I don’t think this will ever be anyone’s favorite book in the series, I’m certainly glad I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.  If I ever get a chance to see it, I’ll jump.  If you are a fan, go into it expecting a play script instead of a novel, and you’ll be just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

What, exactly, was Rowling’s role in this? Was she the true author of the tale, or is this, as many have claimed, basically glorified fan-fiction? And even if Rowling really is the auteur behind it, do we want to count a script for a play as the eighth true entry in the Harry Potter books? And as if all that’s not enough, even if we accept all of those things, how are we really supposed to judge this as anything but an incomplete vision, a partial rendition of something that can only truly be experienced on the stage?

They're all valid questions, I think, and I'm not sure I have answers to any of them. I love the Potter series a lot, but I'm not a die-hard; this isn't something I grew up with, but something I came to in college and afterward. And so, while I'm curious about Rowling's role, as a movie geek who's pretty much a strong advocate of auteur theory, I'm okay with accepting Rowling's authorial stamp, as nebulous as it is (and even though I'm quite curious myself as to how much she contributed, even if I have my own theories). And the question of how it fits into the canon, or if it's a ""true"" eighth volume...honestly, it doesn't matter as much to me as I know it does to some who grew up reading this world. I just want to know if it's a good story.

And the fact that it’s a script? Does that hold back that story? Well, if you mean, “did I spend half of my reading time wondering how on earth you could possibly stage something like this,” the answer is an unequivocal yes. The play we have the chance to see the script for is a dazzling, incredibly ambitious work, one that strikes me as a jaw-dropping work if it was properly accomplished. Because make no mistake: this is a play, but it’s one that embraces the world of Harry Potter. If what you expect is some tight, one-room drama, think again; there are wands glowing, spells flying, people transforming, flights taken, objects coming to life, and even a montage of time somehow evoked. This is a play done with ambition to spare, and while I can’t imagine how it’s accomplished, I can’t deny that reading the script made me so, so jealous of those who have a chance to see it.

But can we judge the story that we’re given? I think we can – and more than that, I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as some people do. I’ll try to steer clear of spoilers here beyond, say, the first few scenes; suffice to say, Cursed Child revolves around Harry’s son, Albus, whom we first met in the epilogue to the 7th book (a scene which opens this play). As Albus goes to Hogwarts, he’s forced to deal with life growing up with a very famous name, and the realization that whoever he may be, he’s certainly not his father. And that tension – on both the part of a frustrated Albus and a baffled adult Harry – provides much of the emotional richness of the play. Indeed, like the best Potter books (and if it means anything, I’ve always gravitated to Azkaban and Half-Blood Prince as my favorites), Cursed Child uses its plot as much as a way of exploring emotional territory, here engaging with reputations, parental expectations (as well as the difficulties of parenting), reminders of the past, guilt, and so much more. And it does so while delivering a far, far more ambitous tale than I expected, one that could easily have been an 8th novel in the series.

But would it have been? There’s no denying that there are definitely scenes and ideas that feel off about Cursed Child, and it’s not just about the fact that a central mechanic and idea of one of the books feels like it’s been majorly retconned to make this story work. Nor is it the sometimes gratuitous fan-service in the form of characters and callbacks (indeed, even as I admit that some are a bit much, there are more than a few that made me smile to read, and I can’t deny that reaction). No, as much as anything, it’s the occasionally iffy character work, because whatever else you can say about Rowling, you can’t deny that her characters lived and breathed in glorious ways. And while there are some great turns here – Albus is good, but his best friend (another child of a Potter alumnus) is even better, and adult Harry is a compellingly flawed character (a fact that’s caused much consternation, but ultimately ranks as one of my favorite touches of the play) – there’s also more than a few who are served poorly, and the fact that many of them are women is even more disappointing. (To waste Ginny in the play is one thing – she wasn’t much of a character in the books – but to squander Hermione’s presence and character so much is far more disappointing.)

And yet, for all of those flaws, I can’t deny that I really, really enjoyed Cursed Child. Would I rather have had this as a novel by Rowling? Undeniably. It might have been the same; it might have been better; but whatever else, it would have her voice, and that doesn’t always happen here. But even for that, as I read Cursed Child, I remembered just how rich and incredible Jo Rowling’s world of magic really is, and even as part of me wanted to cynically grumble about callbacks and cameos and retcons, I can’t deny that there’s so many moments that worked for me. And while the plot is serviceable at best, there are glimpses here of the imagination and scope that made the series so memorable, whether it’s a brief window into the worst possible outcome of things, a plunge back into a rich mythos, some perfect character beats, or even just the sense of imagination at picturing some of these things on stage. No, Cursed Child isn’t maybe the “best” 8th book we could have gotten, and I know some will say it’s not even a book. But in a lot of ways, I think it keeps Rowling’s spirit, world, and characters alive, and even if it gets a little fan-servicey, it’s done with love and respect, and with an imagination and scope that does the world right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have a feeling it is much better on stage.  I also believe that, had Rowling chosen to write this as a book, and not a play, it would be getting much better reviews.  Rowling's writing isn't allowed to exist and wrap itself around us as the original seven books do.  Instead, everything is stripped away.  Good for an actor's ""show, don't tell.""  Bad for us who can't see anything.

That being said, Rowling could still create a plot that drew me in, excited me, frightened me, compelled me, and encouraged me.  Worth a read. For those of us though who will never be able to travel to London to actually see the play... for those of us who could never afford to see it: well, Rowling has shorted us a bit.

When I heard that this was coming out, I was thrilled. I was also thrilled about it being set up as a play. This book was assigned to me in a playwriting class. When I started it, my smile sort of began to fade. It was a little difficult getting into, but as it progressed, it got so much better. By part two, I could not put it down. I loved the idea of getting to see the 19 years later. This story follows Harry's middle child, Albus, as he goes to Hogwarts and befriends an unlikely person. Part one of the book is a slow escalation to the nearly falling apart of a world all Harry Potter fans know and love. Granted, this book is very different than the other seven, but it can stand alone on its own two feet. If you are a Harry Potter fan, I suggest giving this a try. It might not be your cup of tea, but don't knock it until you try it. Even after a year of being on the shelves, this book still gets hate. I can see the point of view from people who dislike and like it. I had feelings from both perspectives, but I have read it again since the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

For the overly critical, get off your high hippogriff. Had Ms. Rowling written this same plot as a novel you'd be calling it a masterpiece. Some of you are giving it 1 star because it's not exactly what you expected and now you're throwing a fit. It's like giving a hospital a 1 star rating because you stuck a cucumber up your butt and now you're dissatisfied because this just wasn't what you expected and the ER can't get it out fast enough.

Nineteen years since the battle at Hogwarts, Harry is back with his friends fighting with forces from the dark side.  He is also struggling in his relationship with his adolescent son who thinks he has a lot to prove being the son of a very famous wizard.

Review- 4/5 stars
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the book every Potterhead has been waiting for since they first finished Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Except it isn't what we were expecting. This eighth installment in Harry Potter's world is a script, and is being performed as a play in London. I hadn't read anything about the play, so going into this book I had no idea what was going to happen. However once I got my hands on a copy at midnight, I devoured it. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a very entertaining and enjoyable read.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child takes place nineteen years after the events of the Battle of Hogwarts. It is the story of Albus Severus, the son of Harry and Ginny Potter, and Scorpius the son of Draco Malfoy. Both boys feel like outsiders at Hogwarts for difference reasons. Albus is a Potter that was sorted into Slytherin, and Scorpius is rumored to be the son of Lord Voldemort himself. So they instantly become best of friends.
Albus Severus was overall a likable character. He was a bit angsty and dramatic for some reason, but he did have nice character development. Scorpius , however was a amazing this entire book.He was definitely my favorite character. Scorpius was funny, geeky, optimistic, and very charming. Occasionally he was a little angsty, but never as much as Albus. I did enjoy reading about Scorpius and Albus's friendship, and how it grew stronger over the course of the book.
One thing I really wished that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child had more of was the classic characters. I would like to have known how Neville, Luna, George, Hagrid, ect. were doing. It would also have been nice to get to know Hugo, James, Lily, and Teddy Lupin better.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child also followed Harry, Ginny, Hermoine, and Draco. Harry's scar has been hurting for the first time in many years, and he is nervous that Voldemort will come back. His wife and two best friends believe him, but his long time enemy Draco Malfoy thinks he is making it up. However, when Albus and Scorpius go missing Draco and Harry team up together to find there sons.
My biggest disappointment of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were the adult characters. Ron, Harry, and Hermoine were all completely out of character. Ron was an idiot, and Hermoine was not as intelligent or determined as she was in the original Harry Potter series. This was very disappointing because Ron and Hermoine are two of my favorite fictional characters of all time. The character that was distorted the most however was definitely Harry. In The Cursed Child Harry was self centered and kind of cruel. Not only did he tell Albus that ""sometimes I wished you weren't my son"" (p. 41) but he also tried to prevent Albus from being friends with Scorpius. In doing this, he threatened Albus and McGonagall. I was really not happy with Harry's character in this book. The one adult character I really did like was Draco Malfoy. He was realistic, and it was nice to see more of his emotions. His love for Scorpius was really sweet, and nice to see. The Malfoys were the best characters in this story,
Now let's talk plot. While reading The Cursed Child I enjoyed the plot. Looking back at it, I have realized how fanfictiony and unoriginal it is. The time traveling plot was basically Back to the Future meets Harry Potter and the Voldemort's child plot was something I read in fanfiction. The other confusing part of this play was when Harry transfigured into Voldemort. Can wizards just transfigure into other people? What is the point of going through all the work to make Polyjuice Potion then? This was an extremely unclear scene in the story. Though the plot was certainly flawed, it was still a lot of fun to read.
Overall Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was an enjoyable read. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter series, I definitely recommend picking it up. If you have read it, please let me know your thoughts because I am dying to discuss it with somebody.

Silva","Homage and Deconstruction","Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2018","This is the script to the stage production of the authorized Harry Potter sequel, and it focuses on the budding friendship between Harry's youngest son, Albus, and Draco Malfoy's son, Scorpius.I read this in two sittings at the Shanghai Library (they don't let you borrow English-language books). It has great pacing, and is definitely hard to put down.

This script does a lot of different things. It is at once a homage to the Harry Potter series and a deconstruction. Some fans are going to balk at the deeply flawed version of Harry, who is trying to hold together a strained relationship with a son who is pushing him away. However, the dialogue is strong in many spots, and the characters of Albus and Scorpio are excellent. Their relationship is really what holds this story together.

The plot relies a bit too heavily on time travel, and on some of the less interesting tropes of that subgenre, but it still manages a few clever twists and surprises, especially toward the end.

There are lots of scenes geared toward pulling on the heartstrings of fans, and many of them were effective. There is some humor too. Scorpio gets many of the best one-liners, while the use of Ron for comic relief felt a bit clunky.

In the end, in spite of some unevenness, this had a solid emotional impact delivered in a satisfying story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Based on a new original story by JK Rowling and John Tiffany -- the script has been written by Jack Thorne, and performances of the West End production in London opened the same day as the book's release (coincidentally, also Harry Potter and JK Rowling's birthday--July 31).

The play is set 19 years from when we last saw Harry at the end of Deathly Hallows (Book #7) -- Harry now works within the Ministry of Magic, is married to Ginny and has 3 children. The story focuses on Harry's second son, Albus Severus, (namesake of both Dumbledore and Snape). In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry, Albus makes an unlikely best friend - Scorpius, Draco Malfoy's son. Albus also gets sorted into an unlikely house -- the house of Slytherin.

Albus and Scorpius soon find themselves on an adventure through time, back to the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which took place in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Book #4) over 20 years in the past. Not surprisingly, they find out that changing events in time is a dangerous & tricky ordeal with dire consequences. They will need the help of their family and friends (including Harry, Ron, Hermione and other well loved characters from the series) to right their wrongs and return to the present time.

The play primarily explores themes of father/son relationships and friendship - the strengths and weakness of both. It is a quick, fast-paced read; I received my copy in the mail on Monday and had it read by Wednesday evening. It is a must-read for any Harry Potter fan, although as a play it lacks the descriptions a novel would have had time to flesh out. As a play, however, it includes stage directions that allow readers to imagine beyond the text -- and it is packed with both action and heart. After a successful run on London's West End, perhaps it will come across the pond, giving American Harry Potter fans equal chance to relive the magic, seeing ""The Boy Who Lived"" once again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The play format was hard to get used to at first but after a while I started to get into the groove of it. However, the story line started off slow and was kind of depressing. The main focus is on Albus Potter, who seems to be the complete opposite of his father and resents living in his shadow. He seemed to be very lonely and depressed in his life and the only positive thing is his best friend Scorpius Malfoy. About 1/4 way through, the book starts to get better when the boys decide to help out Amos Diggory, who wants to use a time turner to bring back his son. Albus and Scorpius make several attempts traveling back in time trying to change the past but all their attempts create terrible butterfly effects on the present. I did enjoy reading about Snape (very briefly) in one of the alternate realities traveled to since Snape is my favorite character, but like other people have pointed out, all the time travel stuff does kind of read like fan-fiction. The book was ok but I was sad that the main characters of the Harry Potter series just seemed to have just gotten old and boring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Harry and Ginny are married with three children: James, Albus, and Lily. Ron and Hermione are married with two children of their own. This account revolves around Albus, the misfit of the family. He is so afraid he will be sorted into Slytherin and in his first year his worst fears are confirmed. These seem to be Harry's worst fears too. An unexpected friendship with Scorpius Malfoy makes the relationship between Harry and Albus drift even further apart. After overhearing Amos beg Harry for what he believes to be the last remaining time turner in existence, Albus gets it in his head that by saving Cedric Diggory he can right all his father's wrongs.

I really liked this installment in the Harry Potter saga. The screenplay format made it a quick and easy read. There was a lot of emotion and feeling. The middle part of the story was phenomenal. Without giving too much away, I loved seeing the alternate versions of the wizarding world. The reappearance of so many beloved characters was a real treat.

The one thing I didn't like is that I felt like some of the characters weren't true to their nature's from the previous books in the series. Snape and Draco in particular. Though I did enjoy the direction they went with Draco and hearing his entire story made me understand more. Also, McGonagall was much more lax as headmistress when as a teacher she was extremely strict and a stickler for rules.

I would give this one a4 out of 5. I liked it. It had some really great parts while others fell flat. The resolution to the main plot was good but I thought the resolution to character relationships I thought was lacking. I would've liked to see a bit more development there. It is definitely worth reading for fans of the series!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I enjoyed this book. I read it realizing it would be in script form, it is a play after all. I was also in the frame of mind that it would be like a fans story of Harry Potter, telling a story of what they would have imagined occurred after the 'nineteen years'. I did not expect another JK Rowlings book.
The story told in stage form was pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading about familiar names and thought the plot a good one. Although in my mid 60's I am an avid Harry Potter fan and remember shedding a tear when  Deathly Hallows2 showed in our local cinema.

I wasn't to excited to get started reading the play format so finished a couple other books first. BUT... Once I got into the story I could not put it down. I disagree with one reviewer who felt the play did not feel like a Harry Potter story. The script format did make for a somewhat ackword flow to the plot. A lot happens from one scene to the next and most scenes were very short. But I could easily visualize the characters and environment as if I was viewing a movie. There were references to many of the events from the movies and I felt this added to my enjoyment of the play. The story is suspenseful and and has some unexpected surprises. There is a cliff hanger between parts 1 and 2 that heightens the suspense. I would like to have read this as a novel; maybe we will see one in the future.

Jefferson","An Interesting Glimpse into Harry's Future...","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2016","The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. The One Who Defeated the Dark Lord. One might think that Harry Potter is fearless. He's up for any challenge. But no one told him that moving on, raising a family, and trying to have a normal life would be more challenging than anything he's faced before.

And one of the biggest challenges for Harry is his son. Albus Severus and his dad have never really clicked. The connection between them doesn't feel the same as the connection Harry has with James. And when Albus is sorted into Slytherin and becomes friends with none other than Scorpius Malfoy, the divide only grows wider. A divide further complicated by the rumors that Scorpius may not be Draco's son. A divide further complicated by Harry's scar acting up. And a divide further complicated by a centaur's vision of a darkness around Albus.

For Albus, living in his father's shadow is challenging. There are expectations. And it's always made very clear when he doesn't meet them. But there's got to be a way for him to do something to break beyond that, right? Something he can do that makes him stand out on his own? And with Scorpius at his side, he's sure he can accomplish anything.

--

I'll start by saying that if you're not a big reader of plays, this one might be a little challenging. They don't read like prose. They're not meant to. And you often have to fill in some of the action and internal monologues based on your own reading of the characters. That's just part of dramatic works as casual reading.

The story here is engaging. I enjoyed getting a glimpse back into the wizarding world. You'll find your old favorites and even some new characters that are a part of the next generation. And the flashbacks to Harry's childhood that were left out of the original novels were also very telling.

Is this another epic Harry Potter adventure? No. But I don't think it's meant to be. It's not a seven-novel saga with a major arc. It's a single story, focusing on the future of the wizarding world, and reminding us that the past can come back to haunt us in ways we never imagined. And those ways are exponentially more when magic is involved.

I've seen some comments online to the effect of ""I've read better fanfiction."" And while I don't want to get into a whole debate in this review, I don't see how that is necessarily a standard of what makes for a good story. For one, it diminishes fanfiction as something ""less than"" quality published work. And I've read many fanfics that were better than some published work. And secondly, what's the point of the comparison? Just because you've personally read something you think is ""better"" than something else, it doesn't--by default--make that something else bad. When I give a book a three or four star rating, I don't say ""But I've read 15 five star books that were better so this is awful."" Context is important, and I think it's something that we as readers and reviewers need to remember. /soapbox

If you're a fan of Harry Potter, pick this up. If nothing else, you'll get a few hours of entertainment and enlightenment out of it. And you'll get to go back to Hogwarts one last time...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_141?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=141&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My son told me about it, and I said, ""It's not part of the original seven. It's not official. J. K. Rowling said she wouldn't write anything more to the story."" But I was curious. And I tried to be open-minded. So I read up on it. I read up on J. K. Rowling's involvement and her take. And I thought, ""Huh."" She seemed to back it 100%, and to have supplied the key details. And I gave it a try. And I was captivated. How to take a story that seemed to wrap up into a happy ending and complicate it with a future? This does it. Stunningly. And sheds additional light on the original seven stories. So glad I gave it a chance!
And yet — upon further reflection — I have to downgrade my rating.
I'd like to give it five stars for characters, 3 for plot.
Let me explain. (spoiler alert)
I LOVE Malfoy's son Scorpius. He beautifully complicates and enriches our understanding of Slytherin. Ambitious to prove himself to his father, but otherwise a wonderful guy. And in love with Rose.
I appreciate Albus and his complex relationship with his father.
I love the greater depth, courage, honor, and humor we get to see in Snape.
I'm grateful to see Malfoy with greater depth.
Harry? Not so much. A disappointment, for the most part, though he comes around. Would he really put his son's safety over his son's happiness? Perhaps. If we're willing to see him parenting in ways that are consistent with his upbringing while seemingly inconsistent with his values. All those who loved him tried to keep him safe when he was growing up — safer than he wanted to be, over and over. And don't we raise our children as we were raised, by default? Any change in our parenting has to be continually worked for, in my experience. To my chagrin, I keep hearing my mother's words coming out of my mouth when talking with my son and daughter — words I cringed at as a child, words I see my children hurt by. Yuck.
But the real issue with this play is time travel.
It's a tricky business.
The time turners are used carefully in book three of the Harry Potter series.
These are used in ways that stretch credulity beyond the breaking point.
To go so far back in time and to change things this much. Would anything be the same? Would the differences be so subtle, the first time around?
And still — though I struggle with the time aspect, I deeply enjoy this play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

That being said I now regret not being able to see the actual play, And how the action and special effects are managed.
Since this is not a written book you cannot see how the characters are portrayed  in such great dimension, this would be provided by the actors on stage.  This being said here are my opinions.
First of all there are two protagonist groups Harry's and his son and best friend.
With regard to Albus, not enough of his life before Hogwarts is discussed, so how he turns out prior to the beginning of the script is only insinuated in later scenes. Thus, while Harry had a few points in his favor before he spoke a word in the first book, Albus starts in the negative and goes lower before proceeding to redemption.  This is mirrored in Harry's path through this story as well.
Whereas books 1-7 had fully developed scenes from daily life with hints at later chapters at the beginning, this story had snippets.  Only when the main arc begins does the story feel fleshed out.
The main arc involves the use of a magical artifact introduced in book 3, and it's results read like a episode of Dr. Who, but allow it's protagonists to mature.
The culminating scenes, while full, were less satisfying than prior books(eg. The chamber and Riddle, Sirius' escape, the graveyard, etc).
The antagonist seemed to be a macguffin destined to mimic the Potter men's issue instead of a true villain.

While it seems I'm being very negative and my review I must now explain why I gave it four stars.  The story reads like a play that was based on a movie that was based on a book.  If you are a potter fan you can fill in most of the blanks and see the wizard world we fell in love with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_200?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=200&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Exciting but predictable... Spoilers are included in this review","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","So here's what I'd say. Get the book but don't try to guess what will happen because it's too predictable. It's like Back to the Future. (That's what my dad said) If you like a surprise do not keep reading. The next part is a spoiler...

Ok so the book takes place 19 years after book 7. Albus Severus Potter is Harry's son. Albus and Harry do not get along with each other. What makes it worse is that Albus gets put in Slytherin. He makes friends with Scorpius Malfoy, who is Draco Malfoy's son. Soon Amos Diggory comes to ask to go back in time using the Time-Turner the Ministry of Magic found to revive his son Cedric Diggory, who was killed by Voldemort. He says that he has discovered news about the Ministry of Magic finding a Time Turner. Harry lies and says that they haven't. When Albus hears this conversation he thinks it is unfair that Harry lied, and that so many people died protecting him or because he existed. So since Albus thought this, he and Scorpius embark on a mission to save Cedric. They team up with Amos' niece Delphi and foil Cedric's first event in the Triwizard Tournament. This changes the history books but not enough to save Cedric. Therefore, Cedric still died, but Albus made his cousin not exist. They go back in time again to foil Cedric's second event. They humiliate him and cause him to lose that event as well. But this made him angry. He became a Death Eater, and the only wizard he killed with Neville Longbottom. However, Neville killed Nagini, so since he died, Voldemort took over the world and killed Harry, so Albus didn't exist. It was down to Scorpius to save the world. He discovered Snape, Hermoine, and Ron had an organization by themselves... secretly. Then they used simple Shield spells to undo the damage. Everything returned to normal. But remember Delphi, Amos' niece? She was really Voldemort's daughter. She used a spell on Amos to make him believe she was his niece. She tried to go back in time with Albus and Scorpius to stop Voldemort from trying to kill Harry so he would never lose his power and have been able to take over the world. They got stranded by Delphi, but Albus finds a way to send a message to Harry. Harry and his group go back in time with Draco's hidden Time Turner. They save the two kids and prevent Delphi from doing anything. In the end Harry talks to Albus and develop a better bond.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I think a lot of us uber fans have to reconcile the fact that we can like something a lot without worshiping it in the manner we may have worshipped the original.

It's a great story, and I had missed these characters so much, so much that I didn't even realize how much so until I heard Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dumbledore, Snape....and Harry speak again.

You cannot understand this play without being a super fan, as there are memories and allusions and hints that you must infer, or they go unexplained.

I respected this. An ode to the super fan....and a glimpse at the future we all imagined when we turned the last page of book seven.

This book may be far from what you imagined and you may hate it...and it doesn't radiate with the charm and language and color of Rowlings' novels, but it made me happy. I got to visit old friends.

It must be the most beautiful production.... I wouldn't even know HOW they could make it into a reality. I wish wish wish I could see it..... What a blast from the past! While I do feel this book felt a bit 'fan fictiony,' I actually really enjoyed it. I was open to not enjoying it and willing to give it a bad review if needed - I am always truthful and honest with my ratings on books. But - luckily I loved it:

The book takes place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts and we follow Albus Potter, Harry's son, who is struggling to live up to the Potter name. There's a lot of conflicts in his life, from a hard relationship with his dad to his pretty grim Hogwarts experience - and so when something happens that means he could change the past and inevitably the future, he grasps the opportunity only to ROYALLY f*!k things up.

I am someone that never rereads a book. That said, I hadn't been swept into the Harry Potter world since I was a kid and I was really nervous that this book would ruin a major part of my childhood. Yes, I was one of those complete nerds who would be standing outside of the bookstore at midnight dressed as a witch, waiting for the release of the next book in the series..... don't judge me.

I'd tried my best to keep away from everyone else's opinions until I'd read it but some people had told me they were really disappointed - I still tried to go in with an open mind though. With that in mind, I really don't understand why people were disappointed in this book! I found it captivating, page-turning and thoroughly gripping. OK, the writing wasn't earth-shatteringly good but it's written in the form of a script and I think they did a damn good job at making it as good as it could be.

I enjoyed being reminded of certain things that happened in the original Harry Potter books that I'd long since forgotten about. I enjoyed catching up with the characters too (although I can never really remember Ron being quite so classically humorous.. I always thought of him as quite ingeniously sarcastic and dry rather than 'trying' to be funny). I am still not sure what I think about Draco's character, he changed the most out of everyone to me - a lot of character development which is always a good thing, but I liked him as the bad boy. Just my opinion.

The plot wasn't as mind-boggling as the original books, it was short and quick and had a direction all of its own and there is nothing wrong with that. You can never beat the original HP books - but I definitely think this book is worth a read nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My rating is 4 because it was more than I expected, it was smart and fun. I see JKR in the story and sequence of events, even though the style is so different.
However, I didn't buy the way some of the characters were represented, Ron, for example, was of a really different personality than in the novels, and I really don't believe he would turn out like that, they weren't fair to him. The way some of them ""spoke"" was also quite different from their usual tone, but again, I didn't expect it to be perfect, so it was good enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is not written like a book it is a play - if you think this will read like a book you are wrong and may not be happy with reading this installment of Harry Potter, but if you have an open mind about reading a play I believe you be pleasantly surprised by the story - you need to read not only the dialogue but the stage directions to really get a feeling for how this reads and the feelings involved in this story,  Loads of emotions and teenage eye rolling is going on in this play - I loved as I am at the age Harry and Ginny are at raising their teenagers and it is not easy to say the least.

I will not spoil it as I had no idea what to expect before reading this play and I really liked it - I had not read anything about it so I would not feel one way or the other before reading this and am glad I did as I am now looking at the reviews and sorry to the haters but I really liked this play - the story goes on with the Potters raising children and the challenges that comes with the choice - kids will be kids and do what they want even when we raise the well - but I love that we revisit the these characters and their lives and what is happening in the wizarding world.  You will enjoy the update on their lives and families - anyone who loves Harry Potter will enjoy this glimpse back into that world - even grown up they still are intriguing as a new generation takes Hogswarts by storm.

Read this play with an open mind and you will see what a fantastic play this has got to be - now I just need to figure out how to get tickets and get myself over there to enjoy this play as it should be done.  I cannot believe anyone really did not like this play - it was a fantastic trip back to the love I felt the first time I discovered Harry Potter.

Let's face it, JK Rowling could write a haiku about Hagrid on a piece of toilet paper and millions of people would fork over $10 for it. This was a great story, it fed my desire for a new HP story, a hold over until Fantastic Beasts comes out. It's a very quick read, maybe quicker if, like me, you are already familiar with the script format. Most characters remain true to what we expect from them, there are a few disappointments.

Wow.

Wow!

I don't want to talk too much about anything because JK Rowling is asking everyone to #KeepTheSecrets, but I guess that's why they make (view spoiler) so I'll do my best to avoid writing about anything specific (and when I do have to go into details, I'll just use the spoiler tags). You're warned. (Quick note to app users—apparently the spoiler tag doesn't work in the app. If you didn't have to click to see the all caps ""spoiler tag"" above, maybe don't proceed unless you've read the book.

I haven't read the Harry Potter series since I've joined Goodreads, so I don't have any reviews or official rankings of them. I've always said Goblet of Fire was my favorite book, although all of them are probably 5* (perhaps I'll reread the series next year!). I enjoyed reading Tales of the Beedle Bard when it came out and I'm always ready for anything Jo wants to give us from the wizarding world (although I did quickly get bored of Pottermore—perhaps it was the slow rollout of content).

I flew through this book in a little over 24 hours. Not too surprising given that it's a play (340 pages of script are a lot easier to read than 340 pages of a novel), but it did feel good to simply devour more Harry Potter fiction. It was great revisiting the characters I fell in love with so many years ago and meeting new characters Rowling created. (I think it's important to point out that the play, as far as I can tell, was written by Jack Thorne and was based on a story created by Thorne, Rowling, and the director, John Tiffany. If I had to guess, the overall outline of what happened/who was introduced was all Jo [her world after all] with some creative additions from Thorne & Tiffany, but the actual acts and scenes and lines are all Thorne.)

What amazed me most of all is how what I read was actually happening right now on a stage in London. I've read plenty of scripts that require a fantastic director to put up (e.g. The 39 Steps & Peter and the Starcatcher—both of which I read after seeing them on stage) but this probably tops them all. It should come as no surprise that the Production Credits list someone as in charge of Illusions & Magic. But still, even simple bits like (view spoiler) are eclipsed by descriptions of (view spoiler), (view spoiler) or (view spoiler). I mean, HOW?! I really want to go to London just to see this on stage.

But I think it would excel more as a magical play than it does as a script. The story was interesting (view spoiler) and it was great to go back to Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic, but it still didn't quite click. (view spoiler) It feels like a cheat to introduce a new type of magic that felt similar to an old type but without explaining all of its differences. Also, there were plenty of times characters did or said things that felt so out of character. For instance, (view spoiler) and grown-up Ron felt like he was just trying too hard to fill Fred's shoes.

There also felt like there were some plot holes with what I remember from the previous seven novels. Perhaps things changed after Voldemort was defeated in Deathly Hallows but wasn't (view spoiler)

In the end, the play feels a little too much like fan fiction and not enough like a Rowling addition to the series. I actually now wonder how much approval she had to give and how much Thorne & Tiffany came up with on their own. It was great seeing old characters again but everything felt a little too convenient (especially this HUGEST of spoilers: (view spoiler) Seriously, WTF?!). But, I still flew through the book and I'm sure the play is amazing to watch... If I could give this 3.5* I would, but for now, I'm rounding up because it was still a lot of fun to read despite its problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_94?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=94&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This book was an enjoyable read, and I do not regret my purchase.  Though it is not as great as the main 7 books, I read it for fun, not for critical thinking or as a ""fine piece of literature"". I don't find myself overly analytical of books unless I get bored reading them - and this book definitely kept my attention.
The characters weren't my favorite, and I was a little disappointed at some of the development of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the other adults as compared to their childhood selves.

The usual Harry Potter plot line is they are all at home about to go to the Hogwarts express (Harry's children this time).  Something a little odd happens before they go.  They arrive at Kings Cross go through the border get on the train say goodbye to everyone. They all talk on the train meet people arrive at Hogwarts meet Hagrid if their first years.  Then they're all sorted into their houses they all have a big feast the headmaster make a speech and they all go and sleep.  Suspicious things start to happen the new trio which in this case would be Albus Severus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, and Rose Weasley  go and try to save the day. Get in trouble all along the way but end up saving Hogwarts. In this book this whole book extends over 4 school years and Rose Weasley is barely in.  But if you do want to see an adventure this might be for you. Some characters disappointingly were not in the book. People such as Luna Lovegood, Teddy Lupin, Victoria  Weasley,  Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley, Seamus Finnegan, Dean Thomas, George Weasley, Bill Weasley, Fleur Delacour, and many others. Neville Longbottom was included but he never actually spoke.  I mean I like the book but it wasn't quite Harry Potter it was not as exciting as it was to read the other ones. You still should buy the book no it's not quite hairy Potter but everyone knows you're anxious to read it. So do because I still like the book and when they no longer sell this version I can say I have it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_165?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=165&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I started reading these books when they came out during my elementary years and finished the last book in my senior year of high school. I was so excited to be able to revisit the magic again. I think it's definitely worth the read. It's definitely a different tone because JK Rowling didn't write this play by herself but it's still super fun getting to go back to the world of Harry Potter. So for that reason I say it's worth reading. Just as long as you go into it realizing it's a play written by three people and not just in JK Rowlings voice.

(First of all, it was made perfectly clear by everyone involved in the project that this is the script of a play and not a novel, so maybe read the description of what you're buying before you whine about it).

A play is a fundamentally different animal and must be read differently than a novel. Your brain must process the information differently. It's a completely different experience. A script is a starting place, it's just the words and the plot. All the magic is filled in by directors and actors and lights and sounds. The magic of a script is how it comes to life in front of you. The script is just the beginning.So of course time is going to move quickly. Of course there is a lot of short hand. Of course the dialogue itself on the bare page without having life breathed into it by an actor is going to seem lacking.
Like reading Shakespeare in school and finding it dull then seeing the Royal Shakespeare Theater perform the same play that brings tears to your eyes -- this is a play and it's meant to be seen.

As someone with vast and extensive experience in theater, I can see the potential for the magic lurking between the words on these pages. I can picture how many special effects would have been brought to life and know how breathtaking that would be. I can see when a line that might read as hokey or flat will bring tears to the audience's eyes if delivered with total truth by an actor in the moment of the drama. If you haven't read a play since Romeo and Juliet your freshman year of high school.... do yourself a favor and acknowledge that there is a lot more to reading a script than merely looking at the words, that the problem here might be your lack of understanding and imagination rather than the script itself.

Not to say that it was wholly without flaws. There was one plot point in particular I could have done without. But expecting this to be another Harry Potter novel isn't fair because that's not what it is. It's a new Harry Potter story, but it's not a new Harry Potter book. The magic in this story is seeing it on stage and watching the world come to life around you. Of getting to dip inside that world for just a little while. Don't expect it to be the same as the novels, because it's not and it was never intended to be any more than Harry Potter World was intended to be another Harry Potter adventure. It is what it is and if you don't like it, that's fine, but don't be a baby about it.

Also. The idea that JK Rowling owes anyone anything is ludicrous. If you don't like her books or her play or anything else she produces that's fine. But she doesn't owe the fans anything. She doesn't owe the world anything. It's her world and she can do what she wants with it. She is not responsible for your feelings, good or bad. It isn't fair to heap that on her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Definitely a lot more fun to read than King Lear! I would have preferred a novel. The storyline was good and ticked along at a rapid pace. There was a large cast of characters but it never became overwhelming. Personally I would have preferred more character development and in particular the adult Harry, Draco and Hermione could have been fleshed out a bit more. Instead they were more or less the same as their teenage selves and it was hard to find them credible. The next generation characters were also heavily reliant on the previous Harry Potter books for their development and motivation.

It was fun reading about how the characters we fell in love with are still the same and yet have gone through challenges in the years since the Battle of Hogwarts. The addition of the children make the story well rounded and they become the stars of the story. The same themes of friendship, loyalty and sacrifice are all still there and those are what captivated me through the first 7 books. The story is fast paced and it's a quick read. I'd love to see the play.

A character and a series that defines a generation. Having grown up alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the Harry Potter series has been near and dear to my heart since I first picked up The Sorcerer's Stone. So when I learned that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was going to be published for us to read, I was both happy and hesitant - happy to see what more might be done and hesitant to have the ending from Deathly Hallows changed in my mind.

As Harry and Ginny's son Albus first attends Hogwarts, the apprehension that Albus feels stems from his trying to live up to his father's reputation and expectations. When Albus befriends Scorpious Malfoy and gets sorted into Slytherin, he becomes more and more distant from his father, and Harry's temper eventually gets the best of him. When the opportunity arises that Albus can change the past, he takes it, not realizing the drastic and dark changes it could spark. Albus's actions bring back the pain in Harry's scar, leading him to fear the return of unspeakable evil and confront the consequences of his and his son's actions.

A play is a different beast than a novel, and it's always a touchy subject to revisit a cultural staple that played an integral part in people's childhoods, but this play that visits the famed 19 years later in the Harry Potter world does a good job of developing the characters, both new and old alike so that it still has that Harry Potter feel. Events took place a little too rapidly for my preference, and it was filled with areas in the plot that raised more questions than it answered, but it was an entertaining foray into life after we left the story.

Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Pond","A fun read for Harry Potter lovers","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2016","I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this book and quite a few spoilers that planted my feet firmly on the ""I'm never going to read that book"" side of things. Someone even told me that the Weasley's were the villains in this book! For all those reading this review and have heard the same thing, let me put your mind at ease. That's absolutely not true. But that's all I'm going to say as far as plot and whatnot go because I don't want to give any spoilers. I'm not going to be one of those people.

I will say that, because this is written as a play, it takes a quick minute to get the hang of how to read it. It was slow going at first because I kept skipping over the name of the person who is saying the line and then thoroughly confusing myself. Tip #1: read the name of the person who is saying the line. It's important. Eventually you get a handle on it and then it's like reading any other book.

Well, except that pretty much all the descriptions are missing from this book. Because it is a play, you don't get a lot of details about the setting or what people look like or what they are thinking, which I really missed. But I ended up really enjoying the book! Despite the spoilers, I finished the book more pleased than I was expecting to be. But, I mean, my expectations were really low so take that as you will.

It's a quick read, it's a fun read, especially for any fellow Potterheads. It's worth the afternoon, if nothing but to revisit some of the magic of Hogwarts and the Wizarding World that we've been missing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have read each book (1-7) 4-5 times each.  I started reading them as an adult, so I did not grow up with them as many did, but they are some of my favorite books.  I was worried I would not like this script; that the story would not truly be under JK Rowling's ""umbrella"" or feel like her story/voice, and would disappoint.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  It took a little more work to imagine as it is a script, and I felt the characters were left very unexplored, even the ones we know so well and love. With the passage of time, they have all, as expected, changed and I think they (and we) were short changed by not having them flushed out more.  I am sure the actors playing these parts in London will bring a nuance and depth to the characters that you cannot feel or see by just reading lines; however, I do wish it was a book.  I think it is a really neat story that could have been done more justice in a book.  I do feel a bit cheated in that regard.  I wish she had taken the time to do it properly (as I see it).  I am happy to have purchased it and read it though, and I will do so again and again because I enjoyed the story that much.  Hopefully many of you will give it a chance,and find that the overall feel and direction of the story is very much fitting of the series and Rowling as I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_195?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=195&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"
