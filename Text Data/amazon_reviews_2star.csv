And also because, in a vacuum, it would be a fine, entertaining read. I'm sure as a play, it's pretty thrilling to see. But as a hardcore fan, it was a huge disappointment. I actually am surprised that JK Rowling would put her name on such a mediocre much-anticipated sequel to her series.

I don't want to give away any spoilers here. So I'll do my best to review this without revealing any plot lines. For starters the HP books, in my view, were brilliant on many levels, but particularly good due to their character development, twists and super-tight plot lines. This sequel fails on all those levels. It seems that for some very important characters, Rowling throws her previous character development down the drain. It's really troubling. The plot was also oddly predictable. The play's main twist I saw coming from the first possible moment. (I don't think I saw any of her previous twists coming in the HP books.) And the plot/story itself seems wildly implausible in several areas (whereas in the HP books, if you accept the premise that magic is a thing, the plots/stories seem very tight and believable). There are also a ton of holes.

With spoilers, I could name a few dozen problems I have with the play, but I won't do that here. It's just odd that Rowling seems to ignore the canon she carefully established in the HP series and subsequent writings. I just don't get it. With that said, it's entertaining enough, if you can ignore all that stuff and just treat it as a fantasy play without worrying too hard about it fitting with what we know of the HP universe. But for major fans, it's pretty disappointing, I think. As I've seen written elsewhere, it really reads like bad fanfic. I know I've got high expectations for Rowling, but that's what she's established. They weren't nearly met.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But the problem is there in the name: plays should be watched and not read. (Shakespeare's audiences couldn't read y'all!) But even with that caveat...I was so bitterly disappointed in JK Rowling. I'm a huge fantasy & sci-fi fan, probably stemming from my early Harry Potter fascination. So I've seen almost every time travel trope beaten to death. But other authors (and directors) did a much, much better job.

Maybe I'm tainted by this book in the time period of Fifty Shades (*shudder*) but it feels like something a fan fiction writer would come up with. Half-cocked and just playing around with well-established and beloved characters for the hell of it. I had to wash my brain out with a re-reading of the original HP series to recover after powering through Cursed Child.

I may see the play, if it's a free ticket. Maybe.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This series I would like to read.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2016","It is a play book. Probably nice to look at on stage and some readers with an huge imagination, can see it happen. Honestly, an eight book of this series would have been an nice extra but this book here is just a text book for the play. It shall be the actors who have to blow life in the characters.
Why didn't they (editors) make a graphic novel. The text they have here. It is fast food. The characters of Albus and Scorpius are something I would have liked to read a book about but alas even on stage it will be Harry Potter and his friends who are in focus. Ron and Hermoine are much in love. Harry has a wife called Ginny. They all have a few brats. They have an important job except Ron and Ginny (Joke shop owner, Wife). Did I mention they are very much in love? I really don't care. The Boys are of more interest for me. Their development and maturity would have been stuff for a good novel of its own. A novel I would have liked to read.
This textbook is junk and merchandise. Aunt Rowling will have more money to buy an yacht she doesn't need and sell it after a short time for much less as she has paid for it. Awesome.
The Harry Potter series was my favorite for a long time. I was sad for it to end but that is life all things come to an end eventually and that is good.

So when I spied my sister's copy left unattended on the coffee table, I swooped upon it at nine in the evening and it stayed in my clutches until about midnight, when I turned the last page and finally went to bed. But, this story was not like the others at all. I was happy to pick it up at first, but I was just as happy to put it down and never pick it up again. I expected the script format and that did not bother me. But once again, I will echo a lot of other reviewers on here with two words: fan fiction. Except, this is considered canon (?!) and I find that pretty disappointing. I don't have a lot of time to write this review so I'll just hit on the big points.

To start, the CHARACTERS. Perhaps one could argue this has something to do with the script format, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but have mercy they are all shadows of their former glory. Some of the stuff that goes on in this story is downright cliched and Mary-Sueish. I was literally making weird, disgusted faces while I read it and wondering how Rowling ok'd any of this. Again, it was like reading fan fiction where the author is rushing you past the bits with the old characters and thus turning them into cartoons for the sake of convenience, because goodness knows all the shiny new characters are where the action is at! To be fair, I don't think the new characters bothered me much, but honestly it's hard to pay attention when the rest of the characters have all been transformed into Picasso paintings. This might not bother everyone else to the same degree, as I'm super sensitive to this. Characters are a big selling point with me, and they're the thing I loved must about the HP universe. The fact that the HP world and plot was equally as colorful and engaging were both big pluses, but the most well-structured world and riveting plot will fall flat without characters to match, in my opinion.

Which leads me to the next complaint... what the heck is up with this horrible, over-used plot? This is canon, really?! Oh my goodness, so disappointing. At the big ""reveal"" scene, where you finally figure out what has been going on the whole time, I was thinking ""ah hah!"" for one second (yes, I was a little excited, in spite of all the previous let-downs) and then as it sunk in I thought ""Wait, what? *rereads* Seriously?"". I don't want to delve in any further so I can maintain the lack of spoilers, but wow, did that leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Again, Rowling... where were you? I think the most surprising thing of all about that plot twist is that something so banal popped up in a Harry Potter book... sad! To be fair, there are some points to the plot that are intriguing and well thought-out, or at least okay, and they keep you reading. But after that big plot twist, it is like watching a balloon deflate. It squeals and shoots in every direction until at long last it lands on the ground and heaves out its final, pitiful breath on the last page. And if you're anything like me, you close the book, stare into space for a second and think of the title of this review.

This overall quality of the writing in this book could probably be good in some other series (barring the plot holes... plot holes are not cool), but when you're talking Harry Potter, the bar is raised pretty darned high, and this falls woefully short. If it actually were fan fiction, I wouldn't care, but this book is canon now and that is something I find difficult to accept.

One star because heck, I still read the whole thing, and another star only because it centers around Slytherins and in theory that should be a nice change of pace, even though it had terrible execution as a whole.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Reninger","Wait for it to come as a play or when it is made into a movie","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2016","It's nineteen years later and Harry Potter is a grown man with three children ready to head off to Hogwarts. His eldest son, Albus Severus Potter, isn't that great at magic, gets sorted into Slytherin, and becomes best friends with Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius. Albus is lost in the shadow of his famous father and a bit of a disappointment to everyone around (except Scorpius). Harry is beleaguered both by Draco, who wants Harry to squash rumors that Scorpius is really the son of Voldemort, and by Amos Diggory, who blames Harry for his son Cedric's death during the TriWizard Tournament way back in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In an attempt to impress his dad, Albus and Scorpius steal a Time Turner from the Ministry of Magic and, with the help of Amos's niece Delphi, tries to save Cedric's life. As with most time travel stories, going back in the past to make things better inevitably makes them worse.

While the story itself is interesting enough (though average to poor by Harry Potter standards), the book suffers from being a script. A lot of the stage direction and action seems hard if not impossible to produce on stage. For example, Polyjuice Potion is used to change one character into another. There are a lot of locations and magical fights that are hard to picture as convincing on the stage. An early montage sequence where Albus ages a few years is less effective because I wondered how they could possibly pull it off convincingly. The experience of seeing a production and how impressively they handle things would be much better than reading and scratching one's head at the improbability of executing it well.

I would much rather have read the original story than the play version of the story. Reading a play is a lesser experience precisely because the play is supposed to be produced on a stage with actors, costumes, sets, et cetera. It's like reading sheet music rather than listening to a song. The full experience just isn't there. Of course, the execution of the song could be wonderful or horrible depending on the performer's skills (or lack thereof). A novel version of this story would be better for me because I'd rely on imagining the story rather than imagining it as a stage production.

My advice would be to wait around for a production to come to a city near you or wait for a novel version or the probably inevitable movie version.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But then I read the new Harry Potter play/book

and I hated it.

I will ill try to say why without spoilers.

The characters. We have spent over a decade watching Harry, Ron, Hermione and even Draco Malfoy mature from children int young but strong adults.

Those are not the characters we will see in this play. In THIS play, Hermione is a shrew. And is employed in other than expected after reading Deathly Hallows, and after Rowlings' post-Potter interviews. This Hermione is NOT a nice lady. Treats her friends as underlings and her husband as she would an unwanted stray. With mange. Her brilliance has dimmed to a few riddles weak enough for the reader to get long before the protagonists.
Harry is a workaholic who seems to have avoided his life since Book 7. His desk reflects his personal life, a mess. And his great, hard-won abilities in Defense Against Dark Arts? Not evident in this story. In fact, he seems weaker now than he was in his Triwizard Tournament days. And he, too, is barely tolerable. Not at all the sympathetic waif-turned-savior who we cared for, feared for, and many of us secretly wanted to be...
And Ron. Poor Ron. Always the third in the trio. Harry had his Scar and his Destiny. Hermione had the brains. But Ron... Ron was their heart. Ron was no idiot - ""the best played game of chess"" from the first year days showed us that. But really, without him and his devotion to both Harry AND Hermione, Voldemort would have won. Ron was Harry's first, last, and best friend. And he was all that and more to Hermione. It was Ron, really, who taught Harry what love is. But here - here he is only the Comedy Relief. More pathetic than a three legged dog following the master who kicks him, he becomes less important, less interesting, and less credible as the same Ron Weasley we followed for seven years of his life.
Luckily enough, they are really only background. The protagonists are Albus, Harry's middle child, and Scorpius, Draco's only child. Albus seems the main protagonist, but the story would go nowhere without Scorpius.
Unfortunately, Albus is... Thoroughly unlikable. He lives in the permanent pity-party of a middle child raised in the showdown of a famous father. He divorces himself from his brother and cousin moments after the play begins. He creates his own misery, despite plenty of options.
And Scorpius never fleshes out into more than a weak copy of both Ron and Hermione to Albus-as-Harry. Friend, but with definite suggestions that under the right circumstances, there could be more than friendship between the boys.
And and almost all of Albus' troubles are his own immaturity (even taking his age into account) and his own self-pity, perhaps even self-hatered.
Even his his attempts to undergo trials to better himself, to prove himself worthy to be a son to the Boy Who Lived... Well, unlike Harry, Albus seeks his own trouble, deliberately, with warning after warning, and nearly causes irreparable harm everyone he should have loved.
So, yes. The characters were a let-down.

The setting? Replace ""Hogwarts"" with ""the Tardis"" or ""the USS Enterprise"" and you do not change the story one iota. Just substitute ""sonic screwdriver"" or ""phasers"" for ""magic wand,"" as appropriate.

And as for the plot: I basically told you that it is the story of a middle child of a famous and distant father who tries to find value in himself, but not in any good way. I won't mention plot devices, but let's just say this one has been so overused in the science fiction, fantasy, and even comic book literature of the past decade that there was no doubt that only the use of the Harry Potter name got this play produced in the first place.
In short, there is nothing new. Nothing special. Nothing interesting. Just used plot devices and the destruction of characters the world has loved for nearly two decades to tell the story of an unlikeable, slightly spoiled, self-pitying boy with middle-child syndrome who, when offered a new life, a new chance, time and again held on to his daddy issues so hard that I, for one, only finished reading this play because I wanted to see how low it would sink. As a middle child myself, I had no pity for Albus.

Rowling sold out on this one. Audiences will love to go back ""home"" to Hogwarts and our heroes (with a villain or two, or there is no conflict to resolve). But when they leave, and re-read the original books, re-watch the movies... How many will see the magic in this play was all in their own desire to get more time in a beloved world that ended with the Deathly Hallows?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But, except for this one. I can hardly believe it is a Rowling's book at all. The plot is problematic and vulnerable. You can easily tell it's not Rowling's way of telling stories. I kinda like the first scene, but the followings are just absurd!

I know it is not a book, so my expectations were low. But when, in the presence of Harry, Ron and Hermione polyjuice brewing is discussed and the only objection raised is that they lack a crucial ingredient, I realized JK Rowling was not involved in the editing process and the playwrights never read The Chamber of Secrets. Sigh. Did anyone else read that scene and despair? It takes a month to brew polyjuice potion. But Albus Potter throws out this idea during a scene when TIME is in short supply, suggesting he can whip it up in a few hours. And the only objection raised is the lack of a crucial ingredient. Other than that, Harry and Draco are very in touch with their feelings. And because it is a play it comes across as blabby and insincere. I blame the format. But i think i can look past the format.

The books were rich and full of wonderful characters. Jim Dale, the audiobook narrator, once said he had to do 160+ voices for them.
So what is HP + CC?  A thin play. Yes, there's a plot, and it could have been a fairly strong plot -- for a movie with a lot of special effects. It doesn't read well. No prose of course, because -- it's a play.  No 160 + characters, because -- it's a play. And let's say it, it's not a good play. It's 19 years since we met Harry Potter. He seems to have spent a bit too much time with the Dursley's, his Petunia side is coming out. His wife Ginny has become a saint. Hermione is no longer interesting, I suppose she stopped reading.

My kids grew up with Harry Potter books:  They sharpened their literary teeth on discussions of whether Snape was a villain or a hero and dug through the book for details to prove one another wrong before they ever heard the words ""textual evidence"" in school.  They looked forward to midnight premieres (books and movies) with the same excitement they'd reserve for a big vacation.  I fully expect to have grandchildren named after characters from the series.  I say this to show that we're not casual fans who've watched the movies a couple times.

I'll say it again:  What a disappointment this book turned out to be.

Yeah, it's a play, but the scenes are all short and void of anything resembling the enthralling world that exists in the first seven books.  The magical details that flesh out the characters' lives in the book series make only token appearances in this story line, and no new magic comes to life; instead, we see scenes from the original book series from different points of view.  It almost feels like an outline for another story -- as if the writer (I really doubt JKR did much of the writing) penciled in the bare bones of the plot line and intended to return to fill in the good stuff later --- but never returned.  It's not entertaining as a book, and I would not buy a ticket to see it on stage.

The characters do not behave in a manner consistent with their first-seven-book counterparts.  A character becomes a death eater?  A character essentially volunteers to die?  All of the adults are too busy to pay attention to their kids, yet they don't seem to have much of a social life, and although they have big career titles, we don't really see that aspect of their lives either.  So what are they doing?  This didn't ""feel"" like the world we know and love.  The worst sin, of course, was at the end when the group all went to witness a certain life changing event; sometimes you just have to bluntly speak the truth:  That was stupid.  The younger generation was no better.  The children's personalities aren't well developed, which is a let-down, given that in the original series the characters are what MAKES the book -- even the secondary characters seem to jump off the page with personalities full of both good and bad.  I also didn't like the heavy-handed homosexual overtones between the two main characters; it seemed stilted, as if the writers considered bringing in a theme of tolerance/acceptance ... but couldn't quite get around to deciding whether it was a theme or not, so it just comes off as a weird, incomplete tangent.

I started to give this book one star, which would be fair for the majority of the book ... but I gave it a two because of ONE SINGLE LINE Harry speaks in the final scene.  For those who've read the book, it's the line when he says, ""Yes, but you forget that I never _______.""  That one line was pure Harry Potter.  That line encompassed the friendship and dedication that umbrellas the whole series, and it speaks to Harry's bravery and his determination to do what's right at any cost.  That one line was better than the entire book combined.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling did not write this play. It lacks the wit and heart of the novels and the characters are two-dimensional. This is basic: when writing dialogue, whether in novel form or in a play, a character's speech (rhythm, voice, choice of words, etc.) should define and identify that character, make it obvious who is speaking. Not so, here. Any of them could have been substituted for the other. Also, I was greatly put off by the number of times that the two boys (and their actions) were called 'stupid' by just about everyone.

Perhaps even sadder, for me, was the naming of the character 'Delphi.' Formerly the location for the powerful, noble oracle of Ancient Greece, now for millions of kids, Delphi will  be a name forever paired with an uninspired plot that does not reveal much truth. One of the most famous maxims/sayings attributed to the Delphic Oracle is: Know Thyself. Perhaps 'Know The Books Better' would be more appropriate here.

I read all the books while growing up and have been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and I generally just gush about the book and universe to the point where my friends probably want to hit me. Beyond that, I continue to read the books just about every other year. You could say that I'm a touch obsessed. That being said, I was super excited for this and waited eagerly for it to come out. In retrospect, it could have been my anticipation and expectation for the script that made it come across as just...not the greatest to me.

This script read like a poorly written fan fiction, to be blunt about it. The number of plot holes and the lack of any sort of complexity beyond the weird bending of the scenes made this just poorly executed. I really wanted to like it and at parts I did, but there were just some certain things that I couldn't get past, such as:
- Why Harry was a horrible father to one of his children as opposed to being a great father
- Why Harry was so generally out of character during the entire play
- Why Hermione was written to be so miserable if she was without Ron at her side
- Where is Teddy? Did he want to be excluded from this narrative he did not ask to be in? And in addition to that, where's Hugo? Or Rose? Or James? Where are the other children in this?
- Heteronormativity (or at least what seems to be heteronormativity)

Overall, this book was pretty upsetting to read and try as I might, I just didn't entirely like it. If you're a fan, you're still probably dying to read it if you haven't already. Personally I don't find it to be very canon what with all the plot holes and the out of character-ness, nor do I think it deserves to call itself the eighth story.

Can I have back the two hours it took to read this book?

I didn't bother to flip through the pages before taking the book home, so I didn't realize it was written in play format, not novel format. Well, OK, I don't mind reading plays when I have a clear mental image of how things should look and sound, and after watching some of the movies I can visualize Hogwarts & students pretty well.

The writing was a step above terrible. The scene cuts were amateurish. There's a way that plays are supposed to split scenes, and this isn't it. You don't include important info in the offscreen scene cut and telling who is walking onstage.

The Time-Turner is used in a way that makes even less sense than the original book.
Finding out who the Big Bad Monster was turned out to be.... not the big surprise it was meant to be.
The characters were dumb and dumber.

Thinking about it as a production, I understand the need to have eccentric twists and quirky moments. However, as a book/script that was released as the 8th in the Harry Potter Series...

I'll talk about the bad things first then I will move on to the better aspects of this book;

Firstly, can we talk about how the Sorting Hat is totally out of order? Scorpius went first, then Albus? What even? Also... Bellatrix being pregnant is a big no no. She would be heavily pregnant in Malfoy Manor where she tortured Hermione if she was pregnant.

I dislike how they portrayed Harry. He's so weak in this, it's obvious he is not trying his best! He lost when fighting Delphi: REALLY!?

I really wanted to see Sirius when they used the Time Turner :( perhaps, when Hogwarts is all Death Eater zone and all, after Cedric supposedly won, Sirius survives and is on a truce with Snape? Hmm, would like to see how that would work out though.

Lots of other mistakes that have been pointed out in other reviews, so I'll leave the bad things there.

GOOD ASPECTS; Snape, Slytherin Albus and Scorbus suggestions ;)

Due to it's format, it's a quick read and in just a few hours you could read it from start to finish. It definitely has the tone of a fan fiction and the way the characters are portrayed in their voice and behavior is unlike the original Harry Potter books...it does not fit in. Overall, considering how much my husband and I LOVE the first seven books, this was a huge disappointment. Not JK Rowling standards at all.

My heart soared at the prospect of continuing on the story of our beloved characters created by J.K., it was very pleasant to be immersed back into the wizardry world. However that being said I highly doubt that I will ever pick this up again, unlike the other 7 books that I have read time and time again. Many questions that we were all dying to know were in fact answered, but unfortunately I found myself reading just to find out what happens rather than being utterly bewitched by an unfolding plot. At several moments I found myself questioning the actions of the characters that didn't seem to ring true to the dispositions that was so clearly and thoughtfully painted in the original series. Yes I understand that 19 years has passed and time and starting families will change an individual but they seemed to be acting out of character. The plot itself wasn't even half of the quality that I've seen displayed, to be frankly honest if felt as if I was reading mediocre fanfiction. While I loved revisiting familiar places and faces it was a disappointment. By all means I believe potential readers should purchase it and for out for themselves. To me I found it to be as McGonagall explained the Headmaster Portrait's don't even represent half of their subjects and are not to be mistaken as the actual thing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I wish I could read JK Rowling’s “short story” that the script is supposedly based on, to see how much of the story is actually hers. Perhaps the story was published on the original Pottermore Web site and I missed it? In the script I recognize events that were described in the Epilogue of the Deathly Hallows, but no later events in the script seem at all believable to me. I love JK Rowling’s own HP-related books, but I did not like this script at all. I agree with another's comment: this script is an example of why I would never intentionally purchase any Harry Potter-related story that was not written in its entirety by JK Rowling. It reminds me of things in the HP movies that were not in the books and that made me cringe (Harry hanging out of the flying car; the talking shrunken head on the Knight Bus; …). I wish I had waited to read this as a library book first – I would never have purchased it if I had done that, and I wish I could ask for my money back. At least I “only” purchased the ebook, and didn’t spring for a theater ticket before reading it, or, worse, fly to London to see the play there.

I thought the script badly written and the story arc not realistic for the Harry Potter world that we know from JK Rowling’s books. The characters whom we know say and do things that I thought were out of character and sometimes cringe-worthy (Ginny swears while talking to her son? Moaning Myrtle is x-rated lewd? Ron knows and uses contemporary Muggle slang? Also, “me” is used as a subject in a sentence?); the lines that are supposed to be funny fail to be so (again like the movies that often left out JK Rowling’s genuine humor and added adolescent unfunny lines and scenes); and I thought the attempts to convey deep emotion were false, uninsightful and cartoonish.

I love JK Rowling and her writings about the magical world. I think she is hugely intelligent, caring, insightful, and creative. I wondered why her second Cormoran Strike book was so dark (I won’t be able to read any more of that series), and now I wonder whether it’s because she is, in part, using those books as an outlet for frustration about how others have mangled her Harry Potter/Hogwarts magical world and characters. Of course I may be completely wrong, but I have imagined that after signing away some of her rights to her own material to enable creation by others of HP-related movies, theme parks, and merchandising, she can’t prevent most of what others do now, and I’ve imagined that she often doesn’t like at least part of what others are doing, even though she supports it publicly. I know she does good work with much of the money that rolls in from all of the things that others do, and I believe she is someone who wants and tries to be supportive of other artists (writers, actors, etc.), but I wonder how any inventive author would be able to see her/his creations mangled without feeling pain or frustration or both.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Having read  The Cursed Child, I've decided to use wand and pensive and remove it from my memories. All the original characters are written as flat, one dimensional, woefully lacking shadows of themselves.  And while Albus and Scorpius are better developed characters (and should be), they come across as disconnected from the series, from the history and the legacy. Rowling didn't write this, and it shows. There's probably fan fiction out there that's done a better job.

I had low expectations going into this book and yet I was still disappointed! What a mess! The Characters we all grew to love did not stay true to their character traits. Its like they all forgot who they were! Dumbledore is a weepy wreck, not at all the wise put-together man we all knew, even after his flaws began to show (although granted he is just a portrait so he isn't the real man and told Harry to stop thinking of him as such. I don't know why they even bothered to include him in this honestly, other than to dredge up old wounds that I am sure Harry had long since made peace with). Prof. M seems cowed by Harry! She isn't the tower of strength she used to be and how many teachers still view their pupils as students even long after they grow up because that is the dynamic that they had always had and yet to see them together you would think that he was the teacher and she the student! Why would Harry keep his son away from Scorpios simply over a rumor. Harry himself was subject to tons of gossip and rumor during his stay at Hogwarts where parents (such as Seamus's mom) didn't want their children associating with him and yet he turns around and does the same thing to his son!? I don't think so. He knows the value of true friendship and I cannot, nay refuse to, believe that he would take away his son's only friend. What also really bothered me is that in the Epilogue when Albus was nervous about being put into Slytherin and Harry reassures him that he doesn't care which house he is placed in and that he was named for a great man that was in Slytherin. Did he just lie to his son? Because obviously he did mind. Ron became a moronic idiot that didn't know is right foot from his left and got drunk at his wedding (As though he would do that!!!) and apparently runs the joke shop (where is George? Did he not have the heart to run it after the death of his twin? Did he make Ron a partner and therefore had someone to help share the load of work?) As if that wasn't bad enough the Dialog and plot was eye-roll worthy and full of holes and magical inconsistencies and everything was much too convenient. This felt like really bad fan fiction and even though Harry Potter is technically classified as YA this book felt very juvenile. Like it was intended for a third graders. The play format didn't bother me as it was expected. Thank goodness this was a fast read!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Most of it is made up with the materials of the previous books and the story is predictable with a happy end.
Characters are superficially developed and do not seem to have evolved much after nineteen years and even having fathered children….
This book is not relevant to the series.
The only aspect that I have considered to give two stars is that it is not a book but a play and as such it cannot have the density nor the length of a true book as it was thought to be acted upon. This is the only redeeming fact in my opinion that can explain such a poor rendering of a sequel of Harry Potter’s books.
If you can avoid the temptation to read something new of Potterverse, keep your money (it is far too expensive for what it is) and re-read the previous books.

Maybe because it was meant to be performed live in a theatrical setting, rather than read as a novel, but I didn’t find much to like about this latest outing in the Potterverse.

I understand that Harry and Co. are now middle aged, but if Harry isn’t the Harry we know from the previous novels, then why did Ron, Hermione and Draco pretty much come across as their novel selves, but older? This version of Harry Potter bore little resemblance to the one we’ve come to know and love. One should be consistent and have all the main characters veer away from their novel selves, or don’t go down that path in the first place for any of them.

And this play masquerading as a Potter novel bore very little similarity to the novels we’ve known and loved. The magic, wonder and pathos are mostly gone. The only one little bit of Potter trick I liked was seeing how Albus and Scorpius are able to get back to their own universe.

Otherwise, there was almost nothing about “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” for me to recommend.

Albus Potter is a twat from the very beginning and stayed that way throughout. I don’t understand how or why he is as whiny, arrogant and self-important as he was presented in this book. Nothing seems to suggest Harry or Ginny were horrific parents who threw their heroism in the faces of their children, forcing the latter to live up to impossible standards. I understand drama needs something to grease the wheels to propel the story forward, but imo, it was a mistake making Albus such a git. Good thing Scorpius calls him out on his narcissism and self-absorption!

Good call on J.K. Rowling et al. turning convention on its head and making Scorpius almost the exact opposite of Draco. Now here’s a character I wish had been the main focus of the novel since, unlike Albus, Scorpius actually has personal events directly impacting him in a negative way, and yet he’s not as woe-is-me bratty as Albus Severus Potter.

For nostalgia’s sake, so many previous Potter characters either made an appearance in the novel, or were mentioned, it almost rose to the level of pander. [But, I’m sure many Potter fans will forgive this transgression].

I think the part of the book that most struck me as outlandish was the fact that in the midst of grave, life threatening, apocalyptic events, Harry and Ginny’s other children – James and Lily never once made an appearance. I suppose the possible resurrection of Voldemort and exile of their brother to an unknown time and place was of little matter to the other Potter kids. What’s that?! Albus has been tricked by an evil witch and may possibly be lost to us forever? Hey, I hear Hogsmeade is fun this time of year, why don’t I focus on that instead! The exclusion of the other Potter kids in this regard was absolutely criminal and illogical.

SPOILER!!!
What was also illogical was how quickly Albus and Scorpius trusted Delphi. Right off, I always felt there was something off, something a little dodgy about this character, and was glad to have been proven correct. I could understand it if both boys were first years, and thus, were more easily swayed by her smooth words and tears, but they are fourth years. It smacked of complete plot contrivance that the boys didn’t question Delphi at all, but blithely went along with everything she said and did.  END SPOILER

For the Potter completist, I suppose this book should be read. But, if you are new to the Potter verse, I suggest completely skipping this book. Just read the official Potter novels instead. Your enjoyment of the original Potter works will be well rewarded.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The magic of Harry Potter books is due to the following reasons:
*Realistic characters - multi-faceted, developing
*Action
*Amazing plot twists that make sense
*Very hard to find holes in the plot
*Jo's magical Harry Potter world is consistent throughout all the books, as if it were a real world. The magical world almost makes sense, and really seems real because there are no discrepancies.

This book is missing everything but the action! It's exploiting Harry Potter's name just for the fans to buy the book that is not worthy of its title!
The characters are very flat and shallow. They are not realistic, and there is no character development. (SPOILER: Albus and Scorpius are busy hugging each other; Draco is chummy-chummy with Harry and Hermoine, Harry turns into a cold, flat, unfeeling, uncaring idiot)
The plot does have a twist, but it is not very detailed the way the other Harry Potter books are
The plot has more holes than a sieve! (SPOILER: How did transfiguring Harry into Voldemort not turn him into Voldermort? How did the message stay on the blanket after all those years - was the blanket never washed? How did Lily Sr. even let them write the message on the blanket? How did they see James Sr., Lily Sr., and Harry if they were under the Fidelius Charm? How did it help to disarm Cedric during the first task - someone would have returned his wand! Why was Snape alive after the second time-turning if the only difference was that Neville wasn't there to kill Nagini - Snape had been killed before the Battle of Hogwarts! I'll probably come up with more plot holes, but I just finished the book less than 24 hours ago.)

This book is just exploiting Harry Potter. I will not accept it in my mind as part of the Harry Potter story, as it is not worthy of being part of the series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_90?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=90&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

While the original series was pure magic, this book doesn't come close.  The characters are poorly written, the dialogue is so stilted and unbelievable that I could not get into it.

Wilson","The Curse of the fan fiction","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2016","SPOILER FREE

With 9 years, millions of works of fan fiction, a world of fan theories and wild shippings, since The Deathly Hallows, The Cursed Child is stepping into dangerous waters to call itself canon.

So does it float?

First, I really wish I could see the play – there’s so much in how a good actor can bring something to life that the page can’t capture, unless the playwright has the sparkling wit of Oscar Wilde. And unfortunately, Thorne doesn’t. While a few characters do shine on the page, many feel off.
As a “canon” sequel, this play could have taken the Harry Potter story, for better or worse, in some new direction. Instead, it chooses to play it safe and function as a curtain call of old favorites rather than exploring new ground.

That’s both a positive and a negative. The story as a story suffers for it, but those same choices also serve to insulate the Harry Potter the world grew up with from any changes or damage a sequel could do. So while it doesn’t add anything new or wonderful to the story, it also doesn’t really detract from the original either. It just is.

But is it worthwhile?

The best parts of the story are with the characters who are wholly new to the story – or at least one in particular. He’s a bright point of dry humor and a bucket of cold water on the obligatory-angst-filled pity parties many of the other characters indulge in.

And then there are the cameos. And depending on who your favorite witches or wizards were, you may more or less enjoy them. One had me as excited as possible, and it was handled really, really well. (That means me literally dancing around my kitchen with my Kindle.) There are the inside jokes – though there could have been more – and the intentional? unintentional? references to famous works of fan fiction.

There were the obligatory deus ex machina moments, some heavy handed character growth dialogue (what can you do with the short space of a play?) There were also some meaningful conversations about growing up.

All the same, I wish they would have marketed it as a “one off” rather than a “eighth story.” I know, I know, people wouldn’t have bought it otherwise, but still. It made the moments of incongruity more jarring and annoying than they would have been otherwise. Because, with or without JKR’s input, yes, there are moments in the play where real, important details from the books are either glossed over, shrugged at or ignored. Not little side things. Things that are key to the play’s conclusion and are a big deal in the books. The kind of things that render this play *not* canon, no matter what they say.

So my conclusion? It was fun. I’m glad I read it. But if you please, I’ll be the judge of what I care to consider “real” and those things I’ll shrug off as fan fiction. Because, quite honestly, that’s mostly what this is.

I’ll take Scorpius though. Scorpius makes this worth reading. I’ll very gladly add his character to canon.

******A final note: *don’t* read the HP books before reading this. Start with this, and let this play launch you back into the much superior world of the books. This would be a lame note to end on after all that. In fact, I think that’s what I’m going to go read next……","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My two favorite works of fiction are the Harry Potter Books, and the Original Star Wars movies.  The best explanation about how I feel about this story is that it reminds me of how the prequels to Star Wars felt.  It still has that spark of what made Harry Potter so magical and wonderful, but it fails to ignite into the flame that made the original work so compelling, moving, and lasting in its impact on people.

It may well still be worth your time to enjoy those sparks, and like many of the reviews I view this story not in a vacuum but in the context of it being a Harry Potter story and in my opinion it just doesn't measure up.

That shouldn’t shock you","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2016","WARNING: SPOILERS

I’m disappointed.
That shouldn’t shock you, Rachel, or the rest of the die-hard fans. Do you think there is any possible way an 8th story would have met expectations, even if it was in a book format? You should listen to the warnings the original series gave us about bringing back the dead. Harry Potter is basically your childhood. The stakes were astronomically high.

Wait, did Back to the Future and Twilight have a baby?
I’m not sure. I got lost. Too many time turners, and I’m not buying that “Voldy” (how sensitive, after a generation of genocide) had a kid.

How could J.K. Rowling write this?
She didn’t. If you read it as fan fiction, you will be less disappointed.

“It is a script, dummies. You aren’t experiencing the real story because you have to see it in person.”
What percentage of the fan base can feasibly fly to London and secure a ticket? Why on earth are they selling the script for twenty-bucks a pop if it can’t stand alone? And I’m sorry, but a plot hole is a plot hole. Why revisit and muck up the great, iconic scenes (as much fun as it will be to re-read the Triwizard Tournament picturing two dorky boys lurking around)? Why not create an original story?

Wait, did Ron just turn into Fred or George Weasley?
Love potion gag gifts? Didn’t he almost die from one of those once upon a time?

Come to think of it, are any of the characters themselves?
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Hermione so incompetent or Harry so blah. And I’m totally buying that a little humiliation from the ever-courageous Cedric turned him into a raging death eater.

Serious question, why is Draco not in Azkaban?
He was a known death eater. Why is Bellatrix rotting away while he is out and about with his secret time turner?

Come on, wasn’t there anything positive?
The nervous, I-might-throw-up emotional excitement I felt for a sustained five minutes before I could muster the courage to open the book was thrilling (it is not every day you think you get to read Harry Potter again for the first time). To be fair, I also had a hard time putting this script down. Humanizing Slytherin was a good move. Scorpius is a decent character. Meeting Snape again was nice. If this was published and recognized as fan fiction, I might give it a 3/5. I’m holding back my final judgments until I can see the work as intended, a full performance.

Does this merit “Obliviate?”
Unclear. My initial gut feeling says stick with the original canon. I’ll accept this as fan fiction and save my pennies for Hamilton.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_98?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=98&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As J.K. Rowling did not write the book, the characters in the play feel like strangers. The tone of the book is just...off. The plot-line is weird, and doesn't follow along with the logic and rules established in the series.

Personally, I think this book reads like fan-fiction - but BAD fan-fiction, to say the least. I spent my teenage years on sites like MuggleNet, and I have definitely read some good Harry Potter fan-fiction in the past.

I was going to say it is sad that many will not be able to afford to experience this as intended since plays are so expensive. However, in truth this, story is so lacking in substance and imagination that it seems not to be a product of JKR at all.  The play may have wonderous staging, but the story will still be, as someone else pointed out, at the level of lesser fan fiction. The bit about Ron at his wedding, what was that?

Not a die-hard fan like some people are, but I've always loved to read, talk about and analyze the Harry Potter books. Seeing that I would never likely make it to London to watch this much-anticipated play, I decided to spend the 15 dollars and at least read the script. My impression was that this play would be really fun to watch, with dimensions brought alive by the acting, stage tech, props, etc.
However, the script itself seemed very amateur. There were parts that almost made it, but overall, it felt as though I was reading a fan-fiction. The character and plot development were weak. I understand that this is a script for a play so it could lack the complexities we found in the novels. However, the characters seemed two-dimensional or out of character. The things they did or said were either too predictable or too outlandish. Basically, I found this world of magic unbelievable and shallow.

The plot was not entirely predictable, but it was definitely not original. It felt like a (spoiler here?) mash-up between Harry Potter and Back to the Future 2. The theme was obvious, but could've been delivered in a more masterful, creative way than was presented in this script.

All to say, this script will fall short for Harry Potter fans who love the books for the intricate plots, attention to detail, and complex character developments. Because this script lacks all of that. As I said in the title, it may be great to watch the play unfold on stage, but it certainly wasn't as exciting to read on paper.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I like to think of myself as an early adopted, getting into the Harry thing before it became a fad.

At this point though, Potter's cultural respect has dropped to about on par with Justin Bieber. So a new book needs to go along ways to redefine and reinspire cultural norms.

Although this book was a page turner, it didn't meet that bar. It tells the story of Harry's son, a privileged white boy. Harry Potter is a global empire at this point; why not use it as a force for good? Like why couldn't this book address themes of sexism and racism, rather than perpetuating the patriarchy? Because, at this point, there's no point in trying to be popular; there's no beating the HP record in that regard. So you might as well go big, and write something with the possibility of furthering an agenda of cultural transformation.

I will note that I was fascinated by the book's theme of time and time travel. Like Cloud Atlas, I felt the time travel reinforced the significance of certain themes far beyond what is normally possible in a narrative. Our actions bear so much significance [and cascading chaos] in a world where we're cognizant of parallel universes. I found this element of the story redeeming.

For a first a book coming from the indie genre, I might give it good marks. But given it's heritage, I can only rate it poorly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling has a better executed plot and is much better at fleshing out new characters, but she is oddly weaker at giving the canon characters interesting adult stories. Rowling's conception of the Hogwarts universe is seen through kids' eyes and flipping it around so the previous heroes are now the boring adults (and yet still get half the scenes) isn't easy.

The Fantastic Beasts movie, which is basically a superhero movie set in the Harry Potter universe, is a much better vector for future exportation, I think. It allows Rowling to explore semi-adult story lines without the burden of the original characters.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

There is a lot here that is funny, cute, and interesting, but calling this play canon makes the original Harry Potter series look like a joke by association.  I feel like this would be better received if it were presented a dramatic interpretation of Harry Potter (à la 'A Very Potter Musical' but less comical) rather than ""the eighth story.""

The good:
Scorpius is adorable.
I love the way that Ron and Hermione's relationship is portrayed
There is a lot of interesting commentary on ""what might have been"" if small details in history were changed.
It is often quite funny.
Not relevant to the book, but the acting and special effects in the production in London are supposed to be amazing, so if they released a recorded version I would probably shell out more money for it, despite my disappointment with the book.

The bad:
The plot is bizarre and fanfiction-y in multiple ways. If you've had any contact with HP fanfiction you will easily recognize several tropes that seem bizarrely out-of-place in a real Harry Potter story.
There are multiple plot holes (mostly small, some rather major) and inconsistencies that call into doubt all of the detail and planning that went into the HP universe of the original series.
Rather than taking the opportunity to expand upon the post-war Wizarding World and show us how the world developed in the past twenty years, the play focuses mostly on revisiting characters and events from the original series.  Some characters that I was looking forward to learning more about, such as Teddy Lupin, where completely left out of the story.  Instead, we get to see Snape, Dumbledore, Cedric, and even Harry's parents, which is nice except that I already got well acquainted with those characters in the original series and was looking forward to something new.

Basically, I think this play is written to give a nice emotional high to those who are still sentimental for the original series, but anyone who was looking for a new story or expansion of the universe will be disappointed.  On a brighter note, the trailers for Fantastic Beasts look amazing, so at least we still have that to look forward to! :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But despite what could have been a really good storyline, this was almost painful to get through. The writing style and character development were not even close to what one would expect from a Harry Potter novel.  The main characters had the same names as the ones in the original series, but that was the only thing that was familiar in this book.  It was as if the writer had never read the original stories....like they'd heard about the characters from someone who'd read HP Cliff Notes.  And for only the first and fourth books.

There was an amazing opportunity here, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  But this was a major disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I might watch it if it gets turned into honest to god movie, but so far, I'm not impressed. I'll even go as far to say I'm very unimpressed. I mainly liked the original books up to nr. 4. Excluding Cho and all the lovey dovey stuff. I hate book 6, but honestly, I think I like this one even less.

When Harry tells his son what Mrs. Weasley told him the first time he had to get on the platform I cried. The book went downhill from there, although Snape for his brief return was written perfectly. I saw the late Alan Rickman in my head during his parts. Perhaps if I wasn't a huge fan, it would be a decent story, but still only decent. Entertaining enough, it had moments in it that were clearly the characters personalities as I knew them and then there was the rest. It felt like fan fiction, based on someone that has some serious daddy issues. The father and son relationship issues in this thing border on Tobias Wolff. Maybe JK didn't have the heart to tell someone while this make look good on stage it reads poorly, not because it's a play but because it lacks the genius she created. Since she wrote the screenplay for Fantastic Beasts I expect the movie and screenplay will be amazing.

C.","Needed more of the ""J.K. Rowling"" magic","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","As with every other reviewer, I'm an avid fan of the Harry Potter books. But what fascinates me the most is Ms. Rowling's ability to tell a great story. She has an adeptness at story telling that is masterful and all encompassing. Her books transport you into the environments as well as the emotional/mental realities of her characters. By the end of a book, you feel that her characters could be real people and you care what happens next.

Unfortunately, the Cursed Child is missing her literary touch.

I think part one had traces of it, as if she had some say in the initial character development. I was ready for the original motion picture cast to come back to the big screen (I was then brought back to earth when they reintroduce one of my favorite characters whose actor counterpart is no longer with us 😢. Talk about a crash landing...). The second part, though, just feels rushed and half baked; like a quick wrap up versus the ""let's bring it on home"" an epic deserves (Think Jurassic Park 2 versus Aliens).
Being released in script format means that readers are going to have to do a lot of the ""magic"" themselves,  something Ms. Rowling's fans are not used to doing. I hope that she decides to take the basics of this dialogue and creates a true 8th edition to the Harry Potter series. Right now, it feels more like the movie version of The Goblet Of Fire: a 700+ page book, shrunk to a 2.5 hour movie.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The themes of how our histories can continue to haunt us despite our best efforts are interesting to explore.

That said, I find it hard to believe Rowling would allow this adaptation of her material to go forward.  It offers an incredibly superficial treatment of those themes in a frenetic plot that features key characters constantly running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The worst element of this story is how it turns Ron Weasly into a complete fool . . . in every incarnation.  Though he is supposedly an auror AND inexplicably running George's joke shop, he never has anything better to do than pop in at Hogwarts.  While I grant that Ron was never the character with the greatest depth, he wasn't a complete and total fool--there was a reason why Hermione loved and married him.

Albus and Scorpius are funny and echo the original trio in important ways, and it's interesting to consider what it would be like to be the son of the famous harry potter.  Draco Malfoy is surprisingly the only character who gets any depth, but it doesn't always ring true.  When he tells Harry how his father disapproved of his marriage, one has to wonder why Lucius Malfoy was walking around free to harass his son when readers have to assume that all surviving death eaters were surely thrown into Azkaban.

Readers are also likely to find the play format frustrating, but you have to take it as it is.  I would not say I regret reading it, but it's definitely not worth full hardback price, even from Amazon.  If you're OK with eating a cheap fastfood burger when you crave red meat, then read it.  I say that seriously, not sarcastically: sometimes we take what we can get in the face of a serious craving.  However, this book, like the burger, seems unlikely to provide much satisfaction.  Depends on your point of view, as the number of five-star reviews make clear.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My hunger for more Harry Potter Sagas blinded my logic and now I'm here writting a bad review about the book "" that should not be named"". How on earth this book got published? Harry potter saga books are well written, with an engaging plot and characters. This book could have had so much potential if it was written by JK Rowling. But it was not the case. The characters are nothing like the original ones. Sound different, act different and just doesn't make any sense. The only interesting thing about this book is the relationship between the two kids. Maybe the writers had a good idea but the execution of the book is poorly.

This is not an adventure or mystery, like the original books. There is very little (practically zero) magic (ideal for a live stage production). A couple of potions, a few unlock spells. Certainly nothing 'new' to indicate the wizarding world advanced anything in two decades since Hallows. This is a morality play about forgiveness and redemption, coming of age and parents relating to their children; it could have been set in any small town in any time period, with normal people, and it would sell about 20,000 copies.

As canonized Harry Potter, it's a real disappointment.","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2016","Before I dig in, I feel like I need to give the obligatory introduction. I really love the Harry Potter series. The original seven novels are, in my eyes, true masterpieces, and the film series is definitely worthy of the praise it receives. The films have stumbled occasionally but in general, they have done the novels justice.

That being said, I can't bring myself to like ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."" There's so many things I have to say about this book/script that I'm going to try and keep this short and give a simple pros/cons list. Also beware, minor spoilers; nothing plot related, mostly involving the characters.

Cons:
-J.K. Rowling did NOT actually write the script, and right off the bat that's a blatantly obvious fact. It does not sound like something J.K. Rowling would write. It lends itself to feeling more like a fanfiction (which, as I am here to prove, it really is one).
-The plot is very poorly conceived and is clearly meant to cater to fans of the original series by rehashing old events and characters with a twist. Yes, the story does focus on time travel, but I am very upset with how it was handled. I feel like the plot totally butchered everything that made the original series great.
-The original characters do not seem like their J.K. Rowling counterparts. In fact, they all seem very flat and all interactions between them feels forced. The relationship between Hermione and Ron is absolutely cringe-worthy and you really don't feel the connection between them that was felt in ""Deathly Hallows."" The same goes for Harry and Ginny. Everything, including the dialogue, just feels wrong. Heck, the dialogue feels like it's trying to imitate Shakespeare at times, and it's very annoying, because the main characters of the original seven novels NEVER used language in this most bizarre manner.
-On that same note, there are hardly any new characters in this play that are constantly in the limelight, apart from Albus (Harry/Ginny's son), Scorpius (Draco Malfoy's son), and Delphi Diggory (Amos Diggory's niece). And there is very little progression in the development of these three characters. We get bits and pieces of information, but just barely get the full story. There are a handful of others, but otherwise, this new play--which is meant to focus on the next generation--spends an awful lot of time focusing on the generation of the original seven novels.
-After reading and digesting, I have no idea who the cursed child is. There are three contenders: Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi. There are certain aspects of each character that could lead you to believe that any one of them could be the cursed child the play's subtitle is referring to. Maybe all three of them fit the bill. Perhaps the play should have been named ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Children.""
-There are so many other things I find disappointing, but it all amounts to this really: the ""Cursed Child"" reads like a fanfiction. It was written by somebody else and it clearly caters to fans of the original series to get them excited to see their favorite moments and characters revived, but it never amounts to anything. The climax is sadly very anticlimactic, as is the resolution. All-in-all, this play really does nothing to progress the plot of Harry Potter.

Pros:
-Even though the plot was very poorly executed, the general concept is rather intriguing. Had it been written better--perhaps by Rowling herself--I would have found it much more enjoyable.
-There were several occasions--sadly far and few between--where the dialogue felt like true Harry Potter, in the sense that it was witty, genuinely funny, and enjoyable. Regrettably, those moments are few.
-Critics of the London production have stated that Scorpius Malfoy is the standout character of ""Cursed Child."" I couldn't agree more. Out of the main new three characters, Scorpius was developed the most and he really was the most intriguing. He breaks from the Malfoy mold in the sense that he is kind, intelligent, and humble. I thoroughly enjoyed his character and I wish all the other characters had been as fully developed as Scorpius was.

In the end, I was rather disappointed with ""Cursed Child."" As the title for this review states, if you read this play as a fanfiction, it isn't terrible; you may even somewhat enjoy it. But, as canonized Harry Potter (yes, J.K. Rowling canonized this), this is thoroughly disappointing. As canon, ""Cursed Child"" is the official eighth story and the sequel to ""Deathly Hallows."" As canon, ""Cursed Child"" is the official new ending to the Harry Potter series, and that truly disappoints me.

I really wouldn't recommend reading it, but should you choose to do so, don't go in with high expectations, because ""Cursed Child"" will fall short on many aspects. Nonetheless, it is a quick read, as it is a script. I read the whole thing across three days, but in total it only took me about four hours. Give it a go if you wish, but be prepared to be disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

It is rather short, I read in about half a day's time. Not an issue for me, as long as the story is good. This was written as a play, but the formatting wasn't really an issue for me; there are many great stories presented in this format. I imagine that the special effects were quite dazzling on stage, and that it would be... Fun to watch.

The story is fair, and I guess that's where mine and everyone else's hang up lies. Harry Potter is much beloved by me and my family.  The dialogue seems very Americanized and almost ""pop culture-ey"" and some of the exchanges feel tired and chiche'd, lines that you've heard many times in low budget, straight to DVD presentations. A good example is

**SPOILER ALERT**

Severus Snape saying ""Did I just quote Dumbledore?"". Not only is this completely out of character for him to say, he obviously had great faith and respect for Dumbledore, but would Severus Snape..

**END SPOILER**

...actually use those words to express that thought? The long and short answer to that is ""no."" This dialogue was so very distracting that it took away from the story, which was about the only thing this work had going for it.

I think that HPatCC had a lot of things going for it that it took poor advantage of; one of the main advantages being that these characters, for the most part, were already well known and loved, so much time didn't have to be spent on developing characterization. But what characterization there was either seemed to contradict what Rowling had spent 7 books building, or took it to absurd extremes, such as was the case with Ron Weasley. His character could have been removed entirely from the story and the entire plot would have stayed the same. He was characterized as an almost simple-minded idiot that had no grasp of the events occurring around him, and his character's main function seemed to be to make very corny jokes that seemed to be basically ignored by the rest of the cast.

The plot was ok, but didn't really have the depth that I would expect from a Rowling work. It seemed to try too hard and failed to achieve that wistfulness and bitter sweetness that drew us into the original series and really, I cared more about what happened to the poor facsimile of my hero HP than to the main characters. The stakes didn't feel all that high, there didn't appear to be much sacrifice for the resolution. I didn't really feel very sympathetic to the main character at all, who just appeared to be an angst-ridden teen who's main problem in life was that he happened to be the child of someone famous, and who was so self absorbed that it barely even registered on his radar when his best friend's mother passes away.

Disputes its problems, it was still nice to revisit old friends and the whimsical wizarding world, but to do so in such a fashion makes me wonder if it would have been better to leave well enough alone. I saw another review that wondered about the extent of Rowling's involvement with the project and I have to agree. As an American, I had more Brittish phrases coming into my head reading this than were ever spoken by the characters, and when I began to read Harry's parts with an American accent in my head, I felt like there was a huge problem. In short, with all the magic written into the play, it felt more like a Michael Bay production (big on special effects, low on depth, feeling, characterization, motivation, and all those other pesky little things that most people feel make a good story) than a Harry Potter installment. Not a total waste of an afternoon, but not an entirely satisfying afternoon, either.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_93?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=93&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Non-spoiler

I planned to read the story all in one day, which for Harry Potter fans isn't much of a feat. It's only about 300 pages and it's a script, so you get through each page pretty fast.

I had read a headline the week before that said ""Be Prepared to Fall in Love with Scorpius Malfoy.""

They weren't kidding.

Scorpius almost steals the show, and it's hard not to love him--and that's going mainly off his dialogue (since that's what scripts are mostly made of). The two spoilers, along with a few other solid surprises came up in the first 60 pages of the script. I had to go to church a bit after that, and I'll be honest, I was hooked into the story and didn't want to go. The whole time I kept thinking about Albus and Scorpius. I couldn't wait to get home and read the rest. I've read some fantastic books since Deathly Hallows came out, but I haven't felt this level of fervor in years--and I missed it. There is just something magical about a Harry Potter book and its affect on me. When I was reading before church, I didn't want to eat. I didn't want to go to the bathroom. When I came home from church, I hurried and made lunch as fast as possible and only when I had two bites left of my taco, did I realize I'd forgotten to put all my ingredients in it.

And I didn't care. I rushed back to the book.

From there . . . my reading experience became less and less . . . joyful. In the set-up of the story I smelled hints at a plot that could potentially go wrong and fall flat. There were even some parts where I thought, No, please don't go that direction. And some of them did go that direction, unfortunately.

Unlike some writers, I'm not totally against cliches. They just either need to have fresh twist or be really entertaining. The plot of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child felt like a cliche--and it had neither a new twist nor was it wonderfully entertaining. In fact, it reminded me of fanfiction, maybe even less entertaining than fanfiction, or fan plays for that matter (A Very Potter Musical anyone? Ridiculous, but very funny and entertaining). I kept wanting to have ""down time"" from the actual plot, because the characters and relationships were really where the story's strengths were, and the plot itself was predictable and kind of a gimmick--just there to bring in action, adventure, and a little bit of magic, and to, unfortunately, resurrect an already satisfyingly complete story. The Harry Potter story is a fantastic story, and it's complete. Resurrecting it only pales what we already have--because it can never be as good. It's better to leave it and start something fresh with these characters.

Look, I get it from a marketing perspective--wanting to get in the adventure and pay tribute to the plot and characters that came before to appeal to the audience and all that, but I would have enjoyed the story more if it wasn't trying to do that. Look at Lily and Snape's backstory. I've never met anyone who didn't like it, and many fans would love it as a book. It didn't need the bangs and the adventure. It was already interesting and compelling--and so was the set-up of the Cursed Child. Heck, even the Marauders' story had some adventure (werewolves and tricking Snape to see one and all), but it was toned down (and better) than the adventure they tried to resurrect in Cursed Child.

So the plot fell kind of bland. Unfortunately for me, once it got going it kind of became the sole focus of the story, when I yearned for ""down time"" to just be entertained by the characters and relationships and their day-to-day life.

It has some really great lines of dialogue. And it's hard not to love both Scorpius and Albus. And I really appreciated some of the tough truths the story touched on, some of which made me love the characters from the series even more.

And other than the trio (which Ron rocks, by the way, and it was nice to see since I feel like he got toned down in the latter movies), it was so nice to actually see Ginny being Ginny! I love Ginny in the books, but thought she and her relationship with Harry were awful (and awkward) in the movies, so it was refreshing to see real Ginny again, and it restored my faith in their relationship. Faith in Ron and Hermione's relationship was also renewed.

All in all, my favorite part of the story was the set-up, and the relationship between some of the characters that I'll talk more about below, but don't want to spoil.

And I must admit, there were parts and things that definitely alerted me to the fact J.K. Rowling didn't write this. Harry did something in it that I couldn't picture him doing. Actually, he did two things. I couldn't see him doing this exact thing, so I thought he had to have an ulterior motive, that the object he had or was giving had to be a portkey or something, but it turned out he was really just genuinely doing it (though it did become important later). A few of the other familiar side characters felt a bit off here and there too, but only a bit and only here and there. And there were a couple of tiny, tiny continuity errors.

But I'll talk more in detail about what I liked and didn't liked below, just wanted to start with a spoil-free section.

My Advice for Potential Readers

Overall, I'd say most fans should approach this story as an unofficial story. Maybe read it at least once, just to enjoy the characters and great lines. Don't read it for the plot. And don't consider it all canon (""official""). It's not good enough to be canon. Or, you can be like me and pick out the stuff you liked to be canon and the rest to not be. (For me, that was mainly the set-up.) Honesty, I think the story is worth reading just for Scorpius and Albus. Just know there will probably be things in it that you don't like.

**Minor Spoilers in this Section**

The best surprises of the story were in the opening, in my opinion. The other ""surprises"" that came out later were predictable and cliche. But, seriously, they had some good character ideas. Here are some of the best things about the opening:

Good Ideas!

1. Albus is sorted into Slytherin.

Okay, to me this is genius. We all know how the epilogue goes, right? Albus is scared of being sorted into Slytherin, and his older brother teases him about it. But then, he actually is sorted into Slytherin. Whether or not you like that fact, it definitely makes for an interesting story that promises conflict. I mean, he gets sorted into the house he didn't want to be in--and is the only Slytherin in a family (and extended family) all full of Gryffindors! And, yes, thank you, we need a good Slytherin main character.

2. Albus quickly becomes friends with Scorpius Malfoy

Okay, yes, yes, yes! Perfect idea. I mean, seriously--Malfoy's son? What's he going to be like? How can they be friends? What do their parents think (hint, neither of the fathers are thrilled). We all know how dreadful, (and yet rounded) of a character Draco was, so this immediately gets interesting. Especially since Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose, tells Albus that he should pick his friends carefully. Ironically, we get like this nice tribute to Harry as a youth, where Draco told Harry to pick his friends carefully, and he stood up for his unpopular friends. What's cool here, is that Rose (who actually loves and wants to take advantage of the fame she's inherited from her parents to gain social status) tells Albus to pick his friends carefully, and he picks Malfoy's son--whom everyone hates already.

3. Scorpius Malfoy, his Reputation, his Parents, and his only friend Albus

Scorpius isn't like his father. He loves his father--a lot more than Albus appears to love Harry, but he isn't like Draco. Scorpius isn't ashamed of his dad, but similar to how Albus has to deal with living in Harry's shadow, Scorpius has to deal with his dad and grandparents supporting Voldemort back in the day. As a result, he's hugely unpopular (though I find his character quite lovable). Albus doesn't fit in and is teased for being sorted into Slytherin. As both misfits, they become best friends. Side Note: Get this, neither are athletic, and they don't like Quidditch. Haha, kind of loved that opposition to their dads.

But it gets better. Scorpius's family being hated the way it is, there is a rumor around Hogwarts that his parents couldn't have children, so they used a time-turner to send his mom back to Voldemort's time, and that Scorpius is actually the son of Voldemort. I found the rumor completely, wonderfully ridiculous, and perfect for the sort of things that kids and teens would come up with. While Scorpius doesn't like the rumor, he puts up with it in stride.

Then there's his parents. Draco and his wife, Astoria. They really did struggle to have kids, and Astoria has horrible health. So you can't help but really feel for Scorpius. I feel okay saying this because it happens in the set-up of the book, but Astoria actually ends up dying. And Scorpius asks Albus to come to the funeral--even though both their dads don't like their friendship. And Albus is like, ""Of course. I'll be there.""

4. Hermione is Minister of Magic

I was really surprised when I first read this spoiler. I didn't see it coming, but then I kind of loved it. And I think it suits her well.

5. Harry dealing with life post-Voldemort

Sure, I said a few things felt a bit out of character, but mostly, things were good and there were some points that I thought were really great and spot-on. Harry has to deal with being famous day-to-day, for the better or for worse. A random person comes up and asks for his autograph (something that would annoy Albus), while other people (particularly a character we've seen before) blames Harry for avoiding him and hurtfully pulls out some facts about all the people who had to die around him. The dialogue there is very well done, and it is hurtful, because, as we all know, Harry already feels bad about the people who died on is quest to destroy Voldemort. He doesn't need the world and old friends blaming him too. His famous status also puts a big strain on his relationship with Albus, who hates it. And when Harry is trying to work on this relationship, he has to deal with people storming in, often unwelcome, into his family life.

We still get so see that Harry has a temper (unfortunately, he loses it with Albus, who he finds a difficult child). He says something hurtful and it felt both sad and realistic, and I appreciated that, and because we all understand that Harry has a temper and gets impulsive and mouthy, we can understand him and still love him.

And yes, if you were wondering, he still doesn't do his paperwork and Hermione still has to get after him for it.

I didn't find Harry's difficult relationship with Albus annoying or depressing, but something I could definitely see happening and appreciate. Like I said, it's the relationships in this story that are interesting. And perhaps one of the highlights of Harry's character in this book for me, is him admitting that he finds it hard and very scary to be a father, because he never really had one, and all his father figures died. So, he's doing the best he can, but he's afraid it's not enough, or he's not doing it right. He still has nightmares about his childhood and teenage years, and even admits he has developed a fear of the dark.

To some people that may make him sound weaker, less brave, but not to me. To me, it gave 30-40 year old Harry depth. Besides, courage isn't the absence of fear, it's pressing on despite it.

Then we have Harry dealing with Draco, who can't really hate Harry, but feels like Harry is always blaming ex Death Eaters for things--and that dialogue was good.

6. Ron

Okay, seeing Ron as his goofy lovable self and Harry's kids loving it, and hearing them call him ""Uncle Ron."" He gave me a few good laughs, and has his own moment of bravery and willing self-sacrifice. Some great Ron and Hermione moments. Seriously, I don't get people who say they don't belong together--they definitely do.

7. Ginny

I already mentioned her, but adding her to the list. She's not a main character, but I kind of loved her.

Bad Ideas

1. Plot (More on this in the spoiler section)

You get a few hints in the set-up and a little after that there might be some time traveling in this plot. To me that was an immediate warning signal. The typical time-traveling story has been done so many times in so many shows (and cartoons), that my first thought was, this can't be good. And it sounds like it might be like fanfiction. But I loved, loved Scorpius and Albus, so I thought this could be entertaining (at least let it be entertaining!). Then there were some other things and what did happen, which I'll talk about in the next section.

So, I'm going to talk about the stuff I didn't like more in the next section, because it's more spoilery.

But here's my point I want to emphasis. The good ideas were good ideas because the writers were playing with foils (opposites)--smashing together the sons of rivals, making each son opposites of their dads in some way, and in some cases, opposites of each other (Scorpius is envious of the adventures and fun Harry Potter had with his friends at Hogwarts, while Albus actually doesn't like Hogwarts hardly at all (which makes him more difficult for Harry to relate to) because of the negative attention and the bullying he gets). They weren't ""cartoony"" opposites there for the sake of it--they were genuine opposites that made the characters and their relationships more complex. It wasn't one-dimensional. And it felt fresh and fun and exciting.

But the plot didn't feel fresh. It didn't have the same level of tension because it was predictable and we've seen it a dozen times.

The true strengths of this novel lie in the characters and relationships--and the writers should have catered to that more . . . and picked a different, more modest plot.

**Major(?) Spoilers**

Plot

Okay, wow, a time travel storyline you have probably heard of in dozens of fanfictions from dozens of franchises. I'm not against fanfiction. And I know that some of them are bound to have ridiculous ideas, that's just the way that genre of writing is. But at least they are entertaining ideas and situations. I'm sad to say, I didn't find this time travel story very entertaining, other than a few good lines of dialogue. The moment Albus and Scorpius went back in time, I knew what was going to happen.

And for the record--I can even like this type of plot if it's pulled off really well. I'm a big (new) fan of Back to the Future. Watched it for the first time this year and absolutely loved it. But the thing is, I found it so entertaining. Cursed Child did not give me that level of satisfaction and fun. Why did they take that approach at all? Okay, I answered my own question near the starting of this--but still. I think most fans would have liked a new adventure better. A dark wizard, or magical creature, or vampires, or something.

Then, there is the thing with Delphi. The Thing. If you've read this, you know what I'm talking about.

I've heard of the theory of Bellatrix and Voldemort having a child before, and the first time I heard it, I rolled my eye at the complete ridiculousness of it. --until I actually read the essay. I'm sure I can't find the original one I read (now that the internet is overrun with the Cursed Child storyline). But if you had read it, you may have been close to converting over to it as well--if not right away, days after, once it had sunk in. The subtext is all there for it to be read that way (whether or not they actually did have a child) and Rowling is very particular and intentional in her details. I don't know that she honestly decided they had a child, or if she liked putting the subtext there. But along with all the subtext in Bellatrix and Voldemort's dialogue and the subtle descriptions of the way they talk to each other (once compared to having the tone of ""a lover""), you have to admit, Bellatrix is notably absent in the end of the Half-Blood Prince, and we aren't given a real reason as to why. And besides, if they did have a child, or were trying to have a child, I can't imagine Rowling choosing to make it obvious in a book that is still shelved as childern's literature (and let's not forget, Bellatrix is married to someone else).

I'm still not sure if I can actually believe that Voldemort is even capable of having children. I mean, he is an 8th of a person.

Anyway, I realized that the theory actually had some evidence thanks to the essay, and when I was reading Cursed Child, I had the feeling that theory was going to be realized. But here's the thing. I think in the right hands, someone actually could have pulled it off well. But in this story, with Delphi being Voldemort's child, at least in the script, it felt way too one dimensional to me. Like it was just there for some action and adventure, not for any real significant meaning. Maybe it's conveyed differently on stage, but it felt too shallow and simplistic in the script for me.

I had a problem with Harry at one point actually believing Scorpius could be the son of Voldemort (I thought that facet of the story was more fun when I thought it was simply a ridiculous rumor). I didn't see it--unless he was really, really blinded by his emotions and concern for his child, but it didn't come off that way to me (maybe it does in the stage production). Him coming to that conclusion just wasn't thought-out enough for my taste.

I like the themes in the story, and I think they did a good job of getting them across.

So is it worth reading? Maybe at least once, just so you know what it is. It's not very long. But let's do ourselves a favor and don't take it as ""official.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_101?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=101&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

""Did we work Hagrid in? Check! How about Snape? Check!"" It's all very contrived with none of the nuances of the beloved series.

This was mostly awful.  I knew it was in script format long before it came out so that was not the problem.
!!Minor Spoiler Alerts!!
Harry and the original characters seem to have had complete personality shifts.  So many examples, way too many to list but would Harry really have a distant relationship with one of his children considering his own childhood?
So much of it was a cut and paste of events from the original books. Events and outcomes were changed and then went back to where they were.  Characters mourned and remembered fondly were back, if only temporarily and it felt like cheating.  One particular scene near the end was just cruel and unnecessary.

Bullard","Disappointing","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2016","I bought this book locally on sale. If I could have, I'd have given it a 2½ because I'm swinging between it being just bare okay and being disappointed in it. Harry seems like a different character than in the original series. Actually, all of them are significantly changed to the point that they are hard to recognize ( just dropped the rating back to 2). I can't see Harry relating to his son the way he does in this play. Voldemort has a daughter? Come on. Overall it feels like a not quite as bad Highlander II movie that was so far removed from the first movie that it was a whole other story. The beginning is so choppy it reminds me of Ralph Bakshi's attempt toe retell the entire 3 volumes of LOTR in a single 133 minute animated film. I would hate to be the director who had to make sense of the sudden and chaotic shifts between scenes of the early first act without a narrator announcing them so that the audience could follow what each was. The plot line borrows heavily from other stories like Back to the Future, the main character(s) go back in time and mess things up, then have to go back again to straighten things out, etc. It is disappointing.
Addendum: I confess that I wrote the above after reading only Parts 1-3 and I was debating whether to finish reading the book/play. I did finish. It did not change my opinion. I agree with those who object to the alterations of the characters and plot of the original books, especially the alteration of Ron. He was not the jokester in the novels, that was Fred and George, nor did he come off as someone who would be so drunk at his wedding that he wouldn't remember it. Ron was a sober character in the novels, quite the opposite of the way he is portrayed in this play. I feel that the characters of Harry and Hermione have been diminished badly also. Upon reading part 4, I was particularly struck by Harry telling Albus that because he didn't have a father as an example, he didn't know how to be a father. I was in that same boat with my children and I can say with certainty that any man as brave and loyal as Harry was portrayed in the novels and as sensitive would never tell his child ""I wish you weren't my child"". Growing up without a father present makes one acutely aware of the need to be a good parent even if one fumbles with how to do that and saying something that hurtful to a child would not happen.
Finally, I turn to the flaws of logic (yes, I know it is a magical world). Harry's scar hurt because it connected him to Voldemort via the piece of Voldemort that was in him making him the last Horcrux. When Harry died and returned he no longer was connected in that way to Voldemort. That is why he was able to kill Voldemort. As long as that was in him, Voldemort could not die. But there was nothing about the scar that connected Harry to Voldemort's daughter and Voldemort was dead, thus no reason for the scar to hurt. Lastly, it was impossible for Albus to bring Voldemort back in the way described, i.e. by causing Cedric Diggory to turn to a Death Eater, followed by Voldemort's victory and the death of Harry so that Albus was never born. If Albus wasn't born he could not have gone back in time to interfere in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Without that interference, the outcome of the Tournament would not have been changed nor would all that this story alleges followed. It is an impossible chain of events. The person causing the change is not born, therefore it can't happen.
A story about a child born to the famous Harry Potter being troubled by living in the shadow of his father is ripe with possibilities but this tale does not live up to those possibilities IMO.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But it was enjoyable as vaguely interesting fanfic rather than a legitimate part of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the characters but they weren't very complex and they were rather flat. Honestly my biggest issue with the play was the plot. So prepare yourself for

SPOILERS!!!

None of the plot makes sense because it involves using a Time Turner to travel back in time and change the past- which is not how time travel works in Harry Potter. It is very well established that when you go back in time using a Time Turner you do not change the time line- in fact the fact that you went back in time has always been part of the time line. Much like time travel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This is fairly crucial to the plot of Book 3 because Harry knows he can produce a patronus and get rid of the dementors because he has already experienced this the first time.  If time travel worked the way it does in this play Harry would have been kissed by the dementors and never had the opportunity to go back in time and do anything- it would have been the end of the series. Furthermore, it would defeat the purpose of Hermione having the time turner in the first place because she would have created an alternate reality every time she went back in time and chose to go to a different class. It would have been unimaginable chaos.

END SPOILERS

So I'm glad I read it, but all in all I think I could write something better and I'm not really that great at writing I just read the Harry Potter books a lot more than these authors apparently did.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Just so you know, it's almost physical pain for me rating this book so low. Never in a million years I would think that I'll give it 2 stars.

I was so happy, so excited for that book. I'd only be happier if it was about Harry and Draco playing with their wands in Room of Requirement.

As you probably know I usually rate books based on feels.
People, I had no feels whatsoever here. I felt nothing during Albus' angry phase. I felt nothing during his talk with Harry.

Talking about Harry's son...
Albus Severus Potter, from the moment I first saw you on the platform all those years ago, I knew you're just a jerk with daddy issues and that you need a b***slap instead of coddling.
Just be fair, people, when you saw that little kid, with the worst names possible, you thought ""yep, you look like something that could grow out of Rosemary's baby"". You didn't? Well, I did.
Just look at him. He's that close to looking like Macaulay Culkin in ""The Good Son"".

His friendship with Scorpius can be easily described like that:
Scorpius: Hey, nobody likes me! Wanna be my friend? Probably not.. that's ok..
Albus: Hey, nobody likes me too! Let's form an emo band and sing songs about how we hate our parents and the world they represent! Let's become angry vegans and live in kibbutz and let's make some questionable tattoos!
Scorpius: ummmmm, ok?

Albus is just an angry teenager whith parents that ""just don't get him"" and the worst friend possible.
We all knew people like that at some point of our lives. Sometimes WE were those angry kids, special snowflakes that will never ever grow up to be like our parents, yet here we are.

Harry is a jerk of a father and I don't blame his kid hating his guts.

What made me really angry in this book is Ron. Yes, Ron. By far my favourite person in the entire series. Here, he's just a gibbering idiot, a comic refief (which isn't particuraly funny, tbh). What was the point of him? Seeing him like that broke my heart. It really did.

I'm not even gonna address the plot because it was very weak and I don't want to waste my breath (or fingers, whatever).
What I liked was coming back and forth in time and seeing the alternate realities...

I also liked Scorpius, because he was just so adorkable I wanted to hold him, protect him from the world, and tell him everything will be ok.
Also, there were gay vibes between two of them and I will fight you on that!

There is one line in this book that perfectly sums my feeling up.
""Love blinds us.""
I think I'm a bit codependend and I have blurred vision when it somes to this world. I wanted to love this book so much, I wanted to be in this world again so much, that I didn't want to see how weak and dull and wrong it was.

When I was reading all was like ""omg Harry! omg finally! omg how awesome! omg Ron!"", but somewhere on the back of my head I was thinking ""Jesus Christ, it's a fanfic that costs $20!"".
Seriously, it's a combo of EVERY HP fanfic I've read (well, maybe besides Drarry ones, BOO!), and believe me, I've read better ones.

If you had a problem with the series epilogue like me, then I strongly advise you to reconsider reading it.
It left me feeling empty inside. I kid you not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The overall plot is focused around the budding relationship between two unlikely characters. Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter, but with the pace that the writing takes it falls short for the character building that Rowling was infamous for. One moment we see our first year students trying to summon their broomsticks and then within fifty pages we have both protagnist as third year students, top it all off with a cliche plot of time travel and turmoil with Harry copping to be a better parent and you have The Cursed Child. I would consider ""The final installment""  to be mere fan fiction that Rowling provided her seal of approval; nothing more. As far as I'm concerned the Wizarding world ended with Deathly Hallows","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The plot was bumpy, predictable, and unimaginative. I felt that the pacing was off, and the ending just felt....forced and hokey. I just felt that this book did a terrible job honoring the characters that I grew up loving.  I agree with other reviews that have said this: no one should write these characters except for J.K. Rowling herself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_82?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=82&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am a Harry Potter fan, even if I recognize that it is not great literature, it is highly entertaining and solidly written.  I do not have an issue that this was a play script and not a novel.  I was prepared and acknowledged that many of the important pieces like the ambiance of Hogwarts and the ""wizard world"" would be missing.  Where I draw exception is how entirely inconsistent this story feels.  The characters don't feel or read like those we've come to love. The plot is juvenile.
For those few of you who love Harry Potter (and haven't read this play yet), you may just want to stick to the original seven books and leave your memory of Harry unsullied by this unnecessary addition.
SPOILER TIME: Ron's character was a ridiculous.  I know many people think he was a little superfluous in the books, too, but now he's just there for comic relief.  Unfunny comic relief, at that.  Cedric being humiliated once and becoming a Death Eater?  I cry foul on that one.  As a character, Cedric was noble enough to tell Harry about the egg, humble enough to admit that Harry had helped him, and kind enough to allow Harry to win the Triwizard tournament with him. Cedric constantly tried to limit his own father's pride, yet one humiliation turns him into a Death Eater?  Not buying it. While I really didn't like the idea of Voldemort's child, it was obvious from the time she was introduced who she was.  I mean, she was THE ONLY influential new person in the entire play!  Let's not get into the whole time turner thing.  That was the best they could come up with?  Such a contrived plot device.  And for pity's sake people, you can't just go whipping up Polyjuice Potion from ingredients someone has in their house; it takes a month to brew!  This was a significant plot point in ""Chamber of Secrets.""  Rowling; why didn't you catch this!?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_98?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=98&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Scott","Be advised: J.K. Rowling did not write this play","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2018","I (like most of the people who read this play) grew up loving the Harry Potter series. I must have reread all seven books a dozen times at least... which is why I could tell right away that J.K. Rowling did not write this. Since her name came first on the credits, I assumed that she had creative control over this project, but I did some research once I had finished and found that this was not the case. She gave the other authors pointers here and there, and perhaps gave them some insight into the characters that only she, their creator, could have, but other than that she had little to nothing to do with this play. I wish I had known that before I bought the book, so I will say it clearly to you right now: if you are looking for a follow-up to the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling herself, this book is not for you.

The story isn't bad and it has some really clever twists, but it reads like a bland fanfiction story (which, in a way, I guess it is). The characters don't have the same ""voice"" as they did in the original series, and it is jarring to read. It is someone else's interpretation of what our beloved characters should sound like, and this made it feel fake to me. The characters also don't speak in a way that sounds natural in general, even aside from them not sounding like themselves.

Another thing I didn't like was that everything in the text was clearly designed to manipulate readers based on their sense of nostalgia. Events from prior books were brought up just for the sake of saying ""hey, remember that thing that happened in that other book you loved? I remember too."" This took time out of the real story and led to too quick of a wrap-up at the end of what could have been a hugely monumental reveal/crisis in the wizarding world, as well as to a complete dismissal of several new characters who were introduced in the beginning of the play. Basically, this play takes bits and pieces from all of the real Harry Poter books and uses them to try to tell a new story that falls flat.

Of course we all want to know what happened to our favorite characters after the Harry Potter series ended, but that is the beauty of reading a really good book: the author brings you to the end of her story, and then you get to decide in your mind how everything turned out beyond that. It is understandable, though, that people jump at the chance to read a follow-up supposedly written by the woman who started it all - but I think now that it might have just been better to let the original seven books end where they ended, and leave the rest to your own imagination.

The thing that bothered me most about this play is not that it is a bad story in and of itself, it is that it was falsely advertised. Sometimes it is fun to read Harry Potter fanfictions online, but you always know that those are not written by J.K. Rowling herself. This book has her name on it, but she was hardly involved with its creation at all. This felt like a betrayal of her readers, and I feel cheated on both a financial level (even as an ebook this book was not cheap!) and on a personal level. I feel like a great friend from my childhood just lied to me to make more money for herself.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Then there were the characters. ** Stop here if you don't want spoilers** Our beloved Harry, reduced to a burned out, overworked adult, disconnected from his family. And Ron reduced to the shadow of his brothers' career. Such overall poor character development, it's shameful. Then there were the holes in the story: How is it that we didn't hear about Hermione walking into her office to find the bookshelves in utter chaos after they found the time turner? Or in the final scene where one minute, Harry doesn't have his wand, then the next he is blasting back at Delphi (wouldn't he need his wand for that??).

McCormick","A plot straight out of bad fanfiction","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2016","*CONTAINS SPOILERS*

There are some things to like here, and I guess it's ok for a Harry Potter fix. But the entire play has got a huge fanfiction vibe that brings it all down. The biggest problems:

- Revisiting scenes from the novels was a bad decision. For that matter, so was having the story revolve around Voldemort again. There have been other dark wizards, like Grindelwald. A new bad guy with no real connection to Voldemort would have been far more interesting. It might have been interesting if the new bad guy didn't even admire Voldemort.

- Like a lot of fanfiction, it broke the rules established for the universe to serve the authors' wishes. Time Turners can now change the past, when Prisoner of Azkaban went to great pains to show how that wasn't how time travel worked. Harry suddenly regains the abilities he had when a piece of Voldemort was living inside him, when the elimination of that piece of Voldemort was well-established as the only way that Voldemort could actually be killed, and it is unambiguous in Deathly Hallows that Voldemort is quite dead. Ron was never established as a practical joker, so why would his eventual employment be the joke shop?

- Voldemort has a kid. Cliché. Dumb. And I can't even see Voldemort wanting to be intimate with someone, not even Bellatrix.

- Voldemort's kid is evil, so apparently being evil was not a choice Tom Riddle made but was just part of his genetic makeup. It probably would have been more interesting if Scorpius had actually turned out to be Voldemort's son and also a good person.

- The relationship between Albus and Scorpius is weirdly-written and is distracting. It seems to tease at the idea that they might be gay, but they don't seem to be. There's no reason why they needed to be, and in some ways I think it would have been a worse decision if they were. But pick one. Either go all in or leave it out. Since they are not gay in the end, their dialogue comes across as stilted (for example, ""As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years...they will find us.""; teenagers don't talk like that in general, and even less so if they aren't expressing an attraction).

- The whole ""will Ron and Hermione wind up together or not?"" thing was worn out even in the original novels. It really didn't need to be brought back in the time travel segments.

- Surely there were better ideas than ""Cedric turned into a Death Eater because he got really embarrassed that one time, causing the apocalypse"".

I could go on, but I think it's pretty clear that there are some severe problems here. I don't exactly regret reading it, but it was nowhere near what it could have been and should have been. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that I would have loved a fresh story in the Harry Potter universe. But this one was one part rehash and two parts stuff that the poorest fanfiction writers come up with. So I didn't love it, and I can't even say I particularly liked it. What little good there is here doesn't begin to compensate for the bad, so the best I can say is ""meh"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

That was my first thought when I finished this book.  It did not read like a J.K.Rowling book, and other than character names and locations, & had almost no resemblance to a Harry Potter book.
I am an avid H.P. fan and have read all the other books multiple times.  To read this book, with the author of the story as J.K. Rowling almost feels like a sham.  Did she conceive the idea for the story, then hand it off to others?  That is how it felt reading this, that here was little (to no) character development, gripping scenes or emotional connection to the characters or the story.  If this was the first HP book someone were to read, my guess is that they would stop here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

There never feels like any stakes in this or near the depth of a normal HP book. I get its a play but they released it as a book so it's fair to compare it to the orevious titles. Voldemort would never want a child and how would he not have known about a kid in Malfoy manor or noticed his lieutenant being pregnant for nine months. He didn't know love hence he would never want a child that could rival him.

Scorpions is one of the best characters in HP history though and getting to see a Slytherin that is good at heart was fantastic. I've always fancied myself a Slytherin and to see Slbus choose Slytherin for his friend was heart warming.

Delphi was a poorly written character needing a novel length book for her back story and motivations to make sense at all. And the most telegraphed bad guy in HP history.

In the end, this story needed to be much more fleshed out. I'm sure it's a fine play and it does have a few good character moments, but overall underperforms and doesn't really further the story or build a new threat.

Dixon","Lacks Excitement","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","So let me make it clear that this is not well-written. It is heavy-handed as all get out in many places and it is barely better than your average fan-fiction. Half the time we spend with characters already dead or that we already know when there are hundreds and thousands of new people we could have met.

I will say that I enjoyed the way they played on the expectations of the reader. At first I was annoyed that they glossed over Scorpius and Albus's years at Hogwarts and didn't detail any of their adventures or lives there. Then, I realized that's exactly what Harry's problem was with his son. He expected him to live up to the family name through some kind of inherited reputation, but the fact is that he hates school and is kind of a loner. I can appreciate when something catches me thinking a certain way without realizing it.

Making this the official continuance of the book series is bad, and it would have been better left alone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

You either love it or you hate it. Given that Harry Potter is such an important part of so many people's lives, the reaction is understandable. I'm very sad to say that I'm firmly in the negative camp.

I wanted to love TCC so much. I was so excited to see an extension to one of my favorite stories. I remember how exciting it was, back in the day, to wait for new Harry Potter books to come out and then devour them in one night, screaming and cheering and crying as these characters I loved so much made their way through their world. I wanted so badly to experience even a sliver of that feeling once again. I picked up the Kindle version of the book with hesitant excitement -- finally, I would get to know just how everybody fared in the end.

The answer to that question was: poorly. Now, I realize that JKR only had a slight hand in this manuscript. It really shows. So many characters felt stilted or wrong. The dialog, which should have been the book's shining light, fell flat most of the time. I tried to imagine it being read out loud by skilled actors and that only made it slightly more palatable. The majority of the new characters felt as flat and undeveloped as a newborn Sim, random attributes thrown together in the hopes that something would stick and come alive. The only exception, for me, was Scorpius, who still managed to have a bit of a heartbeat despite the lousy writing surrounding him.

The story was also silly. It was a silly story. It read like try-hard fanfiction to me, like a soup with too many ingredients. One particular twist in the story was so unbelievable -- in a bad way -- that I found myself staring up from my book on the subway, as if on The Office, gaping at an imaginary camera. I have since read impassioned defenses of this twist that have convinced me that there may, in fact, have been the slightest sliver of canonical defense for it, but, no, it still read as ludicrous to me and completely out of harmony with the world of the original seven books.

In short -- I did not enjoy TCC, but you might, and I hope you do. For many reasons, it didn't work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In long(er): My girlfriend has the trunk-style boxed set of all the original Harry Potter books (she is quite the HP fan). I'm 26, and it wasn't until last summer that I finally read any Harry Potter books. I am an avid reader, just never got around to them, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then I read them, and instantly fell for the writing style. (If you like Sherlocky stories, check out Rowling's Cormoran Strike detective series under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith.) She's such a detailed writer, already one of my favorites; her details are so vivid, her descriptions come to life in ink.

My girlfriend had been on the waiting list for this book from the get. A new Harry Potter book? Score! We both read it in a matter of days. It wasn't at all what we expected.

First off, it's manuscript style (remember those Shakespeare plays in high school? right...). I don't mind that, because dialogue is very important in any story. However, it loses details that you love with a book--there are no thoughts or internal monologues and no detailed background, except for the clunky one-person-is-explaining-to-the-dimwitted-other dialogue format.

Second, I was acutely aware throughout that I was reading a ready-for-performance story. Every character is described enough to get an idea of general features, but vague enough that I couldn't pinpoint any specific trait (e.g. Harry's goofy hair, Ron's red hair, McGonagall's always-on stern expression). It's clear to me that they were writing this story to avoid pigeonholing themselves in future casting. Basically any one person can be every character in the play--which is great for aspiring actors, but less so for those of us just trying to get lost in a story.

Third, the action was written for a play, which relies heavily on visuals in some scenes. ""Epic wand battle"" isn't enough for the lover of the scene breakdown. That's not an exaggeration, that is an actual quote (though now I can't find it to reference, so I hope I'm accurate).

Fourth, the ending was abrupt at best. Without giving much away, I'll simply say this: the whole book is filled with the anticipation of rising and rising and rising action, and finally at the climax, it's just done. Even in Scooby Doo the final plan goes at least a bit wrong. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop until I realized it was already over, and we cut to epilogue-grade garbage for the last two scenes.

If you must must must read this book, check it out from a library or borrow it from a friend, it's not worth the purchase. If you can, wait until the movie comes out, which I'm sure will happen eventually.

PS. Though JK Rowling gets bolded first bill, the story actually was a collaboration between three people and the manuscript itself was written by one of the other collaborators. I think that's part of the reason it is so stylistically different from the other books. I also am not sure how much of this is Rowling's work rather than being a glorified ""fanfic"" written by two guys who were fortunate enough to have input from the original creator.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I fell in love with the lovable and often complex characters Ms. Rowling created in her incredible story, but I was also extremely content with the ending we all were given. So naturally, when I heard about the eighth book I was intrigued but also slightly skeptical.
It turns out that my skepticism was right, as this story made absolutely no sense to the characters we all know so well. This story takes place 18+ years after the battle of Hogwarts, when pretty much all the main characters are grown up and married with children. Harry is painted as this ""big ministry man"" who now lacks empathy towards everyone, including his family, as he is busy running the head of a department at the Ministry. This is completely false to Rowling's character as he was neglected, ignored, and abused for 11 years by his own cruddy family members who treated him as a burden. Harry knows what its like not to have a Dad, so why would he neglect his family, as he was once neglected?
*Slight Spoilers*
Really J. K.? You make Harry a successful auror and head of an important department at the ministry, Hermione as minister of magic, but Ron is screwed over by being some kind of humble little ""House-Husband"" who occasionally serves as the jester of the story? Ron can never replace Fred, because he is his own person. Ron isn't the weak link of the trio, he helped track down the horcruxes and fought with everyone at the battle of Hogwarts, just like Harry and Hermione.
*over*
Coming from a huge potterhead, I wish that I never read this. It tried to derail the ending that Rowling wrote so perfectly and tamper with the wonderful characters she created. I wanted to love this, I really did, but its incredibly hard to do that when was written by two other people who obviously have no proper knowledge of these characters, and wanted to make a quick buck.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

They're not your ""flavor of the week"" fad and they're trend setters rather than followers. They're timeless, engaging, well written mystery novels that are far more interesting and smarter than the movie adaptations make them look (not that the movies are BAD, quite the opposite, but people who are only familiar with the series through them are certainly missing a lot).

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, referred to as ""the eight story"" is none of that.  It's certainly not a book, since it's a play, so what we have here is a rehearsing script.  Now that's fine.  It's understandable, expected and I have no problem with it.  The problem is everything else.  Unlike the books, this story is derivative, predictable, self-indulgent and dumb.  It has many of the characters seen in the original books, but they're there in name only, since their personalities are certainly not the same.  Also long gone?  The smart writing, the nail-biting mystery, the sense of adventure and anything close to actual life-lessons, replaced with childish attempts that border on humorless parody.  This story is fanfiction, and it falls into its most notable pits, doing no effort to avoid them.

Let me give you an example.  Picture you and your significant other are shopping and you say: ""Hey, we should buy milk"", so she/he replies ""We can't do that, we have no milk!"".  Spot the lapse in logic there?  How you offer a solution to a problem and the other person replies by simply stating the problem which you're giving a solution to?  Note how preposterous that is, and how dumb it would be if you just accepted it?  Let me show you the example on the book:

Two guys and a girl are about to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time.  One of the guys proposes an idea:
GUY: ""... we're going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel back afterwards... maybe we should just - try going back an hour first, say, first and then...""
GIRL: ""I'm sorry, GUY, we have no time to waste.""

No time?  NO TIME?  You have a freaking Time-Turner RIGHT. THERE.  Time is what you have THE MOST of.  More than anyone else.  Heck, the entire idea he was giving you was to MAKE TIME.  Your response makes no sense!  And the fact that neither of the guys point it out is even worse.

Now this might sound like nitpicking, but this particular bit of dialogue showcases the main problem with this strictly plot-driven story: logic is set aside because the plot demands things happen.  Characters will go against their personalities because the plot demands things happen.  This is just one of the many aforementioned pits of fanfiction.  Here's a short list of others:

- The Mary Sue: this is a character that has no flaws, can't fail and always has the right thing to say to solve a situation.
- The Obvious Villain: this is the character that you will easily peg as the villain the moment they show up even though the story treats it like an unexpected twist when it's revealed.  A telling sign is that they're too eager to make the plot advance.
- The Derivative Callback: what's a writer to do when he wants to evoke the same feelings from a work someone else started without having any idea how to write well?  Simple, he just writes scenes that are similar to ones created by the original writer in hopes that the memories of the previous ones will be enough to give readers the same feeling.  In this particular case, this gets too on the nose when two guys and a girl use Polyjuice Potion to sneak into the Ministry of Magic to steal a trinket.  I wish I was kidding.
- The Manufactured Drama: this one's obvious.  Drama has to happen, so while two characters could talk like normal people instead they choose to either stay silent or break character just for it to occur, because the writer has no idea how to bring it naturally.
- The Forced Pathos: a writer wants the reader to feel sad, but he can't write compelling drama, so what does he do? Simple, he repeats sad scenes that the previous writer created.  The difference with The Derivative Callback is that these aren't just similar, they're literally the same scenes, step by step, shown either by flashback or time travel.
- The Superpowerful villain: a writer wants the stakes to feel higher, so what's he to do when he can't write compelling characters or situations?  Well, he gives the villain incredible powers, of course, whether these make sense in the story or not.  ""Oh, you thought the previous villain was powerful?  No, here's version 3.0, that old geezer has nothing on MY guy!  What's that?  That there's no precedent for this kind of power in this universe?  Blah, I don't understand those words, look at the fireworks!""
- The Ship: Sigh.  I, of course, mean ""ship"" not as a vessel, but as a verb, as in ""I'm going to pair these two characters together wheter it makes literally no sense or... wait, ESPECIALLY if it makes literally no sense"".  This is probably the most known one in fanfiction (so much that it has its own subcategory, called slash fiction), but it's especially painful here.  Once you read who's certain person's father you'll know instantly who the writer decided would be the mother, even though, again, it makes literally no sense.

Please understand that I gave this story a fair chance.  I was actually very excited for it, I preordered this book back in February.  I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, but I also knew she's not the only good writer in the world, so I gave this what I thought was a well-deserved opportunity.  Instead, I was ""rewarded"" with having to read what appears to be some blogger's Harry Potter, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life's fanfictions all rolled-up into one.

Make no mistake, this is amateur writing at its worst.  I have nothing against fanfiction.  I've read some very, very good Harry Potter fanfiction in the past, but for the life of me I can't believe writing this poor ever got such a chance.  I absolutely don't recommend it, but if you HAVE to read it, then go prepared.  Adjust your expectations as low as possible and you might draw some enjoyment out of it.  But it will still never feel like the touted ""eight story"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As a Harry Potter fan since Sorcerer's Stone was first published in the US, I was excited to have another opportunity to enter Rowling's wizarding world. I went in knowing exactly what this is - a play written by Jack Thorne based on information from Rowling, and felt that I had adjusted my expectations appropriately, but I was horribly disappointed, and quite surprised that Rowling apparently signed off on much of what is in this book.

The plot of the play revolves around time travel, and in order to accomplish this, Thorne has changed the way that the magic of the Time Turner works from the way Rowling wrote it in the original books. Considering that Rowling has been candid about the precautions she took (emphasizing how dangerous it can be to go back in time, placing a limit of a few hours on how far back the Time Turner can take you, and finally destroying the entire stock of Time Turners) to avoid the possibility of exactly this sort of plot device, I found this both baffling and frustrating. The characters we already know were often both out-of-character and oddly flat. One of Rowling's great gifts is her ability to give each character a distinct and believable voice, and that is lost here. The last time we saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, they were teenagers, so of course it is natural to expect them to have changed, but the trio we encounter in the play seem to have almost nothing in common with their novel counterparts apart from names. Hermione, once the cleverest witch of her age and now Minister for Magic, has an office with security so lax that it can be unlocked by a child who knows the Alohomora spell. Ron, whose accidental ingestion of a love potion once almost led to his death, gives a teenage boy a love potion as a joke. Harry, who knows firsthand the damaging influence of neglectful, resentful, and cruel guardians, tells his son that he wishes he weren't his child. Other characters we love are also either misrepresented (would Minerva McGonagall ever consent to a parent's demand that she police the friendships of the children under her care?) or virtually absent - Hagrid and Neville most conspicuously.

There are too many problems to enumerate here, but at times I seriously questioned how it would be possible to read and understand the Potter series and then write this play. Perhaps the ultimate frustration for me is that a writer who was given permission to continue Harry's story would not seize the opportunity to expand upon the wizarding world we already know but would instead choose to use a lazy and predictable time travel plot device to badly re-write scenes we have already read and loved.

Some redemption can be found in the characterization of Draco Malfoy, who is the only adult character who felt true to himself, and whose personality and actions feel in line with the post-Battle of Hogwarts information Rowling has shared with us, and in his son Scorpius, who is a delightful new character deserving of better material. A scene involving Hagrid and baby Harry after his parents' murder is sincerely affecting. In some small moments, the play rises to the level of good fan fiction, but it never approaches the depth or richness of the original series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Even characters original to the series seemed like hijacked versions of themselves. It was like instead of becoming wiser and more introspective with age as one would hope (expect?) they actually became more ignorant and pathetic.  The plot wasn't completely terrible, although it was extremely thin as far as Harry Potter books go.

  GINNY (an equal roar): So is mine!

  <i>He meets her look.  There's real emotion in this room.</i>

  - <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 and 2</i>, by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne

You want to know how it was?  It was okay.  Even at the end of the original Harry Potter series, Rowling's writing was starting to taper off, the plot twists were sloppy, the sweet moments were sappy, and the epilogue smacked of pandering, of some publisher somewhere saying, ""give the public what they want.""  Book 7 lost some of the purity of the earlier parts of the series.  This is like a long version of that much-debated, crowd-pleasing, guilty-pleasure cringe-worthy epilogue.

The characters veer wildly from sounding like themselves to sounding like completely different people.  A few lines of dialog are spot on, but most are dreadful.  Possibly the sentimentality could be saved with good enough acting, but the acting in my head is pretty good and it wasn't good enough to save it for me.

Here's a particularly bad example of Malfoy (yeah, he's in it) and Harry talking:

  HARRY: Quite a surprise to see you, Draco.  I thought you didn't believe in my dreams.

  DRACO: I don't, but I do trust your luck. Harry Potter is always where the action is.

Why do these sound like lines from a Bond movie knockoff (with oracles)?  The depictions of kids don't ring true, either. Moments of solidarity are portrayed with a sappy declaration of best-friendship and a hug, motivations for getting into trouble are thin at best, and problems are solved almost the second they come up and never have unexpected complications.  The plot material is almost completely salvaged from the original series--which I have some grace for, knowing that adding to or changing a beloved storyline is a lose-lose situation for most authors--but I nonetheless feel I shouldn't have expectations for Harry Potter books that are actually <i>lower</i> than my general expectations.

Part of the problem is that I don't totally buy this whole future for Harry, and that's more of a problem with the original series than this particular spin-off.  I think that after defeating the most famous dark wizard of all time and dying in the process, he would want to do something more restful than being an auror, at least for a while.  Also, the Potter gang is charming as rebels fighting the establishment, but less believable <i>as</i> the establishment.  Hermione can pull it off, but Harry?  In the books he always seemed happiest during the DA meetings, and I really think he would have flourished as a teacher, remaining outside of political machinations, and just working toward the common good like Dumbledore.

I didn't get excited about this book, and the only really positive thing I can say about it is that maybe it will loosen up the ""canon"" status of HP, so that he reaches the role of a Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes, and everyone can write their own interpretations and some will be crappy and some will be amazing and that's fine, because at the core he's not an overworked government employee who has an awkward relationship with his son (and I don't buy that either--personal relationships have always been the most important thing to Harry--Hermione might overwork herself but I see Harry as the type that might call in sick just to lay in bed with his wife a few more hours), he's a hero.  And we all need heroes.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The tensions between Harry and his son alone would have made an excellent novel 8 in the series, before we even get back to Hogwarts.
Things like character development, layering of plot lines and the building of interest are lost arts in literature (and even more so in movies and TV !), but Mrs. Rowling is quite capable, her other books are proof of that.
Not sure why she took the VERY easy way out on this one.
Many of the characters are basically caricatures of their original selves, the plot has more holes than thinly sliced Swiss cheese, the whole thing's kind of a mess.
It's ok if you look at it as a potential theater production, which has to be shortshort by necessity - can't keep the audience in the theater for 3 weeks - but it should come with a neon pink warning label : THIS IS FAN FICTION, NOT J.K.

(In the other books, the characters are real and flawed, yes, but their strengths are the focus, making us love them so much as they overcome their problems.) I didn't think I'd mind the script format, but it's super sparse with very little to guide you. Found it hard to picture the setting or hear the character's tone of voice. Part of the pleasure in reading are the way words come together to paint a picture, and this lacks that completely. Just step-by-step dialogue. But mostly, I was disappointed in the story itself, which spends a lot of time showing the characters' flaws and not enough time making us love them.

Not only did I love the series, but it helped me through some truly difficult times. I felt like I knew Harry, Ron, and Hermione; I bonded with the Weasleys, looked up to Dumbledore, and feared everything that Voldemort represented. Let me put it in perspective: My family still will not play Harry Potter trivia games with me. They refuse.

I know that my situation isn't unique. There are plenty of ""Potterheads"" all over the world. The excitement for this screenplay was felt all over the community. People that I bonded with over our love of Potter counted down until the release. I guess the expectations for this were too high...

I hated this. It didn't feel authentic to the characters that I know and love (and hate). I went in with an open mind, because I knew that the format was different. This was a piece that was meant to be seen on stage. Even with this in mind, I could not reconcile the decomposition of character development that took 7 books to build up to. I could not find the plot to be believable - and considering that this is a fantasy work, that's saying a lot. It was wholly disappointing, and I have come to view it as not an extension of the series I love, but fanfiction. I have literally read fanfiction that surpassed this book in quality. It's not worth the money spent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Skylar","Short on magic — 2 & 1/2*","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","Harry Potter was one of the most singular, defining moments of my generation. We anticipated and devoured each book as it arrived, embracing seeing our favourite characters on the big screen year after year. I love these characters and their strange, magical, sometimes dark universe. Simply put, l grew up with Hogwarts.

I wanted to find out what happened to my childhood friends. I had grown up and so had they. We last got a glimpse of their future as Harry and Ginny waived goodbye to son Albus on the train that would take him to his first year at Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child picks up exactly at that moment we were left off all these years ago. To be honest, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not quite the HP l grew up with. Many factors come into play. For one, it doesn't feel written by the same author. The pace is altered and it is not as complex and rich as is usual. J.K. Rowling approved the script, but it seems that's all she did.

Sometimes words spoken or actions taken by the characters feel slightly out of place. When Rowling wrote the books she knew the characters inside out and there was no questioning that fact. As such, many fans feel like they know these characters. It was interesting to see how Harry and other characters aged, but l can't help but imagine some Potterheads might be disappointed by some of their beloved wizard's actions. l found myself questioning some actions thinking they were out of line with the character. On occasion l felt they were dead-on with Ron and at times l thought they were making him out to be a big goof with little substance.

However, much of the intrigue and action of Cursed child lies in two characters, Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy (child of Draco Malfoy). A lot of Cursed Child's development happens between those two characters. To have this much weight cast upon a new addition in the Harry Potter world is a considerable and bold move. A good portion of the book focuses on the boys' relationship. In the HP books we knew Harry, Ron and Hermione were great friends and meant a lot to one another, we weren't reminded of that fact every five minutes. Neither did we have it shoved down our throats the way Cursed Child does with Albus and Scorpius which wasn't necessary.

Without revealing too much Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has more to do with time-travelling and alternate dimensions —and frankly, what ifs?— than anything else. It's mildly interesting but mostly confusing. The idea of revisiting the past is baffling in the first place. I feel J.K. Rowling would have moved forwards in her storytelling, not backwards. Fans have become attached to the stories as they already were and it doesn't allow this new chapter of the HP universe to truly be it's own. In fact all these time travelling elements hinder from the Cursed Child feeling like its own story. Too much of the play is focus on specific events that happened in the past that we're forced to revisit. Part l was mildly interesting but the good elements of the first start to derail in the second. The ending was fitting but didn't feel particularly rewarding. There is a big theme in Harry and Draco's difficult relationships with their sons and the struggles of fatherhood. This added a different perspective to the characters and franchise. If you were hoping for another traditional HP volume, this is not it by any means.

Surely some were apprehensive at the idea of the book being written as a play instead of a novel, l knew l has doubt. The play format works surprisingly well. I was impressed by how strong of a flow Cursed Child had given it's format. The brief descriptions and narration complement the story.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will no doubt be a divisive topic among fans of the series. It's not to say it's all bad. I like some aspects of the book and felt it flawed in others. It's not the heartwarming story it aims to be. Cursed child struggles with it's legacy. Try as it might, this chapter doesn't feel like the true continuation of the tales of our beloved wizard. There is simply less magic this time around. 2 & 1/2 stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_110?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=110&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Rowling. It is not. And even though it’s supposed to have been based off a short story by Rowling, and it appears she has sanctioned this play, I was very disappointed in this book.

Some Background

My husband and I are both HUGE Harry Potter fans. We read the series out loud together early in our dating life (and then later when the last book came out), and we’ve listened to the audiobooks numerous times since then – together and apart. (I’d previously read the first 3 books in the series in college and re-read them all as each new book came out.)

When this play was announced, I originally wanted to go to London this summer for one of the early shows. Knowing that was a little crazy, I instead pre-ordered the script when it was announced. I knew we’d have to read this play together – just like old times.

The Format

The play itself isn’t hard to read. It’s mostly dialog which is my favorite part of many books anyway. It was a little tricky to read aloud because unless my husband was looking over my shoulder, I had to read the character names before reading their lines. I don’t do voices.

The Good

There’s very little I liked about the play. In fact, I’d like to pretend I never read it. I am going to treat it the same way I treat the one fan fiction book I read a couple of years ago, like just that – fan fiction. Even though Rowling gave the idea for this story, I am not going to treat it as canon.

That being said, I was happy with the jobs that Harry, Hermione, and Ginny ended up with. Ron, not so much. One of the additional things I wanted from the epilogue at the end of book 7 was to know what careers the main characters ended up in.

And Albus and Scorpius were really cute. I liked this new generation friendship. Their banter reminded me of Ron and Hermione in the earlier books.

And that’s about it.

The Bad

Without giving anything away, I will say the following:

- The original characters seemed really out of character. Draco was about the most believable.
- I hate time travel stories that mess with the original plot line. If it didn’t always happen that way, then it’s not possible. This book changed too many things, too many times.
- They messed with the way some magical things worked. Time turners don’t need to be touched; they need to be around the people’s necks. Polyjuice potion isn’t brewed overnight, and it requires a hair of the person you’re transforming into. For me, Harry Potter has always been about the details, and they messed with the details with this play.
- Harry is married to Ginny now. Hermione to Ron. Ron and Ginny should not have been on the outside of all of the action. Their marriages were too flat.
- And the big reveal about Delphi? No. Just no. I didn’t buy it.

Conclusion

This play probably makes a better play. If I’d seen it live first, I think I would have just loved seeing the characters brought to life – new and old. I wouldn’t have cared so much about the story (maybe). But reading it as “the eighth Harry Potter” book was just a mistake. Sadly, that’s what I did, and my opinions and rating reflect that misconception.

This book is more like a ""poorly written fanfic"". It seemed fake to me the whole time. You can tell that J.K. Rowling hardly had any input into the writing of this story. It was horribly written. Never have I read a book and been most disappointed in my whole life. The plot was mediocre and the characters (like Harry) were saying things and acting in ways I know not to be true. There was no feeling, emotion, or excitement that the original Harry Potter books have. It's sad because I had such high hopes for this book and it just was not good. I wouldn't even waste money seeing this live.

Personally, as  long-time reader of the original series, I found this book to be rather disappointing. There is so much potential here, and the development just wasn't there. Obviously that is because it was written as a play and was not meant to be as comprehensive as the original books. Perhaps the play would be interesting to watch. However, as a book it feels rather contrived at times and largely missing the original magic of the series. The dialogue often felt, for lack of a better term, cheesy and the characters rather flat.

The script is ambitious in its spells and trying to bring magic to life. The stage directions indicate that it might be wonderful to see in the theatre for the atmosphere alone. However, what I am left with is a book of the stage production. The book suffers from poor writing when there's no acting, no set design, no special effects, or anything else to cover it up. The writing is laid bare to all and it is evident that this story twists a childhood classic into a mere shadow of what it could have been.

The next generation children the Cursed Child focuses on are Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. A story about these two and their antics at Hogwarts would have been satisfying enough, but the play divulges heavily into something that feels more like poorly written fanfiction than something marketed as the eighth Harry Potter story. It's an atrocity that laughs in the face of all the characters we have come to know and love. There are unexplainable liberties taken with this story that make absolutely no sense at all. The trolley witch on the Hogwarts Express? Not simply a sweet lady selling candy. Professor McGonagall is the equivalent of the Goblet of Fire movie!Dumbledore. Ron runs Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with no mention of George? Draco Malfoy is still a tragic figure surrounding by misery and has fanfiction nods to Drarry, Drinny, and Dramione before the story was over. I'm not sure whether I should be amused by this at all, but I am no longer surprised.

The addition of a new character, Delphi, is annoying at best. A twenty-year-old hanging around fourteen-year-old boys? Am I the only one questioning this from the very start? Her lineage plays a large role in this story, but one that's quite difficult to accept as canon. The only redeeming factor in this story is Scorpius Malfoy, who turns out to be a geeky Slytherin and just wants to do the right thing. Albus is a troublemaker, not unlike Harry and James when they were in school, but decidedly going through his teenage phase. I'm not convinced we're not supposed to be shipping Scorpius and Albus after reading this book. They were absolutely adorable together. We barely see James or Lilly Potter (the children, not the parents), Rose Granger-Weasley, and absolutely no mention of Teddy Lupin existing at all.

In the end, it might be a wiser choice to skip this script, avoid the disappointment, and find some well-written fanfiction about the next generation of Harry Potter characters instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The problem with this book isn't that it's a play, it's that the plot is grossly unappealing, the characters are largely unlikable, and nothing remotely NEW happens. If you can ignore J.K. Rowling's name on the cover, you can accept this for what it really is - fan fiction. Very bad, very lazy fan fiction. It is a recycling of old characters, old settings, old scenarios, old everything, jumbled up and spit back out in the form of a four act play. We learn nothing valuable about old characters, and the new characters are all merely reflections of the old characters.

There are small bits, here and there, which are charming, but those moments are brief, as is this book (which won't take more than a sitting or two to read).

This book sort of tarnished that for me. Some parts were nice, like being able to get more information about the fates of the characters I knew so well or about the Trio's families but in the whole it read like a mediocre fan fiction. The plot was awkward and forced, absent of the detail and twists and turns that made the prior seven so enjoyable. It seemed recycled and unnecessary, key points of the plot things very unlikely to happen. Frankly, the only reason I see J.K.

***I am going to try not to let emotions been taken into account while discussing the work that was given to us; I do not wish to be cruel, disrespecting, and condescending but rather critical, logical, and objective. ***

I wanted nothing more than to love this book, but unfortunately I can not ignore the many inconsistency, cheesiness, and poorly-constructed plot present in it. For that reason I am refusing to accept the entire work as cannon.
I had so many mixed feelings while reading ”Cursed Child,” but only after a few days I could finally figure it out why. The book left me a bit skeptical of how much J.K.Rowling actually contributed to this tale. The third-party story is flawed, something that I am pretty sure could have been averted if the original writer herself had written the story independently.
I just want to start by saying that I was fully aware that this book was basically the scripted format of the play. Therefore, I was already foreseeing, and prepared for, the fast-paced actions, dialogues, and story-development.
I have no doubts that the play must be esthetically superb. The acting is being truly praised by many. The costumes and the sets, even seeing through pictures, could have not been any better. The special effects are constantly being described as “breathtaking” and “mind-blowing.” However, if we take out the visual aids (that in many ways divert our attention) and take in consideration only the story line, we can see numerous plot issues present within the script.
This excerpt from a review blog summarizes exactly how I feel:
“Rowling's lack of creative autonomy in the project means that fans can't be sure which parts of the story were her idea — which is cause for some purists to think of the story as a break away from the book canon. The reason this co-authorship can be such a sticking point is that the plot of ""Cursed Child"" is so outrageous to certain fans that it reads as fan fiction.” - Kim Renfro, from Tech Insider.

The main plot is a mess. A few parts that really have thrown me off were:
1. The lack of showing/mentioning a few key characters (where is Hugo in the Epilogue scene? what about other characters, that apparently not even deserved to be mentioned, such as Ted and Victorie, or any of the other Weasleys, Luna Lovegood…?)
2. Rose Granger-Weasley’s character was so conceited, prejudice, disloyal, and obnoxious towards Scorpius and Albus. I felt like punching her in the face. I think the writers overdone it; if they were channeling for a copy of Hermione from the first book, they might have ended up channeling Draco by mistake. And the fact that Ron Weasley was majorly used as a comic relief makes me puke.
3. The Time turner story line... argh! What can I say? It differs so much from the ""laws"" of time traveling given in the 3rd book. And not only that, apparently a RETCON was made to accommodate the new story line. The new information given by J.K.Rowling at the Pottermore site about Time-Turners, and how she decided to get rid of them once and for all in the series, is nowhere to be found. The “lets go back in the past to save Cedric’s life” was so fanfic like. But not only that…
4. The whole rumor about Scorpius being Voldemort’s son was so ridiculous.
5. The dialogue between the characters were, in so many times, contradictory to their characters, childish, cheesy, and cringe-worthy.
6. Voldemort’s offspring plot was unnecessary and out of this world.
7. The fact that major characters, such as Dumbledore and Snape, were brought back in this play just to reaffirm their redemption was also silly. It already feels very clear that Harry finally accepted their different kind of “love” and respected their actions and behaviors when he named his son Albus Severus.
Even though the script had many issues and it feels/seems like a poorly-constructed fanfiction, is incontrovertible that it had a few of J.K.Rowling inputs implemented into the story. Therefore, using one of the most Sirius Black’s famous quote: “We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on[,]” I decide to analyze my favorite parts instead of only bashing the work.
To name a few of my favorite parts:
1. The whole tension between Rose and Scorpius is very visible, even within the Epilogue, in the 7th book. I would like to think that those two had the whole “Romeo and Juliet thing” going on, with the disparities between their families very visible.
2. The relationship between Scorpius and Albus is also something that could have been foreseen, since it would be a way of creating tension between Albus and his family.
3. The whole house's sorting was also predictable (even though I still had hopes for Rosie to be a Ravenclaw, I believe the way it actually went was more acceptable to validate the issues cited above, and to reaffirm the whole “Albus Severus Potter is an outcast within his own family” plot).
4. Draco's redemption was also pretty much appreciated. The fact that we could seen more about his true personality, and how him and Ginny were a bit jealous of the Golden Trio’s friendship, was somewhat bittersweet.
5. I loved the opportunity to get a glimpse of what the Trio is doing with their professional lives after finishing Hogwarts. Expected a bit more from Ron, though.
6. The turbulent relationship between Harry and Albus Severus is somewhat relatable, and I applaud that. From those people that said that “Harry would never say that,” we all will have this time in our lives that we will say something that we do not really mean it. In Harry’s case, and why not say Albus’ as well, that was it.
7. The almost concretization of a homoaffective couple within the saga! *Even though I am gay, and I would love to see some Scorbus action, I ship Scorose since I've read the Epilogue a few years ago.
There is that.
I am a turmoil of emotions.
I don’t know what I was truly expecting, but certainly it wasn’t that.
They would be better of, with the plot, if the writers of the script have brought back the character of Bellatrix Lestrange (since it was not completely clear if she was killed or not, at the Battle of Hogwarts) seeking for vengeance, or (better than that) just focusing on character development on a “family drama.” Who knows?! I just wasn’t expecting it to be a fall back to the most predictable, yet intriguing and awesome, plots of the series (the time traveling and the Triwizard Tournament).
Reading the script by itself, without any visual aspects to take in consideration, we can see it disclosure tremendous plot issues. And sadly, that make this story seems bit of unnecessary for the hardcore fans.
I still am very conflicted if it all was worth it, but I guess since I could sense that the book had the Rowling's hand on it, I would say it was.
Apart from that, I have loved the chance to, once again, be excited for reading a brand new story about the magical world (even though it didn’t last long).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Fowler","A depressingly disappointing installment to a beloved series.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2017","This was a horrible disappointment.

Let me begin by saying I am not bothered it is a play. I love plays. I knew it was a play when I bought it. This review has nothing to do with the format.

The characters in this book, my beloved characters, the characters that I practically grew up with as a child, were not handled with the kind of care and reverence I would have desired. Many of them acted very differently than I would have expected, behaved very differently than I felt their character would.

The story, the plot, felt forced and was bland and practically boring. It was somewhat cliche, a bit all over the place, with no real path or purpose. Harry Potter is the pinnacle of coming-of-age stories, and this falls far short of that. Instead it feels like just some way to parade our beloved characters in front of us to earn a fast buck.

The ""villain"" has no depth, no purpose beyond just behaving the way they do because of who they are. Evil just for the sake of evil is boring, and makes for a boring story and a unsatisfying conclusion.

In the span of a single play, this book attempted to build all of the same relationships and touching moments as the original series so that it felt rushed and poorly planned. It tried to create a strong friendship between the two ""main"" characters, it tried to create tension and fall-out between Harry and his son in order to provide a touching reconciliation.  In the final act when things came together and we got the reconciliations between multiple relationships I felt nothing.

The story attempted to make the two main boys into heroes like the Harry, Ron and Hermione in the originals, but instead they just come off as rebellious teenagers trying to prove something to themselves and their parents, and almost destroying the world in the processes.

The characters we see all grown up, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, and others, none of them really feel like they do their originals justice. Like another reviewer wrote this comes off as a poorly written fan fiction, as whoever wrote this fails to grasp the personalities and characteristics of any of these beloved characters. (HOW is it that Hermione of all people hears that Boomslang Skin and Lacewing Flies are missing and doesn't immediately know what that means and start looking into it?)

I was severely disappointed in this book and would vehemently urge anyone who holds Harry Potter in their hearts and souls to not muddy it with this addition to the series.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As a narrative, Cursed Child breaks established rules where time travel is concerned and takes liberties with the personalities of a few returning characters. The book itself isn't presented as a novel but rather, as a script so if you're looking for something like the previous Harry Potter books might be disappointed by the change of format. Fans of the books reading this script may be disappointed by how characters like Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort have been changed to suit a narrative that they shouldn't fit into. I wouldn't recommend this book to fans of the Harry Potter book series but newcomers might get something out of this.

What makes me look fondly on this book, specifically the hardback version, is how it's heavy enough but also small enough that it makes an ideal tool for killing wasps. Just this afternoon a wasp infiltrated my home and this book was the perfect tool I had to hand to take care of that situation. It only took one good smack to kill the bug and what's better, it was by a window, in a corner. That kind of positioning would have been difficult for a larger book to get to but the hardback version of Cursed Child was the perfect size to get to the pesky wasp before it could do any harm.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, in this form, is a contradictory mess that I wouldn't recommend reading. The stage-play may be worth watching since the stage directions are intriguing but I can't recommend this book. If you don't own a fly swatter or pest repellent/pest control spray than I would recommend this book as a fine substitute.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I wanted to like this, I really did but.... This is the story of a child overburdened by his famous father who does something without thinking it through to prove himself. It ended the way I thought it would. Most of the scenes felt contrived to get us to situations everyone has been craving ie. getting Snape to find out Harry's son has his name. It was lacking scene descriptions to the point where sometimes it's hard to figure out how things happened ie. jumping down a sink drain. The bad guy is predictable. I was mostly bored reading it, knowing what was going to happen. It is every time travel plot from tv shows and movies, where the main character goes back in time, changes something, messes the future up, goes back again, and messes it up more. It was basically the last Shrek movie. I loved all the other Harry Potter books but this was a huge disappointment. Then there are huge plot holes with the polyjuice potion only taking a short while to make, the boys taking a blanket off a sleeping 1 year old and putting it back without the parents noticing people breaking into their house. The minister of magic's office door being opened by a first year Hogwarts spell. Also some of the characters didn't act like themselves. Read it for yourself but be ready to be disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.

There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.

Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have read the books over and over, and they are among my favorite books ever. I know it is a play, but that did not diminish my excitement by much. It's the lackluster story, not being a play, that does this in. The focus on time turning allows for little plot or character development. The writing has none of the complexity or charm of JK's writing. JK did not write it, and I am very surprised she approved this. If this is really how she wants it to end, then it taints the whole story. I will end this spoiler free section by saying that it is readable, but ultimately very unsatisfying, I recommend buying it cheap if you buy. At least you get more Harry Potter after all these years.

SPOILERS AHEAD

First, the good:

- Scorpius being a nice character is welcome

- Albus being a rebel is also a nice storyline, even if he comes across as one dimensional angsty for much of the story

- The descriptions of past Triwizard Tournaments were funny: some of the best lines in the play

- Was a little interesting seeing how the wizarding world would be with Voldemort in power

- The ending where Albus and Harry saved each other kept up the helping each other and love themes from the books

Now the bad:

- Most of the main characters were ruined! Ron was like Fred and George without their wit and intelligence. Ginny hardly had any personality to speak of. Snape seemed too nice, and Harry too meek.

- Way too much time travel! Multiple revisions of time occur from Albus and Scorpius's actions. It was a small part of the books and really helps make it read like fan fiction and not the 8th story.

- Too many inconsistencies, like with Polyjuice Potion and Delphi, who was Voldemort's daughter.

-  Not enough of Hogwarts life is included

- Cedric would not have become a Death Eater! Maybe he would have gone to a different school, but he was too good for being a Death Eater

- Really no good twists to speak of; Dephi is defeated quickly and Harry and Albus make up

We can only hope Rowling makes a proper book 8 and leaves this as the disappointing fan fiction that is is. She owes it to all the loyal Harry followers. This feels like a cash grab.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Partnering up with John Tiffany and Jack Thorne was a mistake. I am not alluding to the fact that it is written as a play; on the contrary I rather enjoyed reading it as such. However, J.K. Rowling did not put as much effort into reentering the magical world as any loyal Harry Potter fan would expect. Seriously?! It took only a few hours to read! In comparison with the other Harry Potter books, I would give this a solid ‘D’.
 I rather enjoyed being able to get to know new characters. Albus, Scorpious, and Rose were easy to like. However, I did not expect that so many chief characters would barely have a role. Shouldn’t Ron have been essential in the story? I had to reread the beginning, but as anyone who is a fanatic would know, Harry Potter and the Dealthy Hallows ended with an interesting epilogue of the trio eighteen years later. The Cursed Child begins from that epilogue. But where are the other children of the trio? I’m most certain that Ron and Hermione were supposed to have another child.
 I’m sure other readers are just as confused as I am. By reading other reviews, it seems as if I’m not the only fan who is disappointed with the effort of J.K. Rowling on something she took so long to complete. I’m also sure that we would all have advised her to write this on her own and give us something more than the feeling of reliving Harry’s story through his son’s perspective. Every other book contained its own mystique to it. We expected more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This is a play and has room to evolve with other shows. Repo! The Genetic Opera was pretty lousy during it's early days but it turned into a cult epic. I would not bother buying this book. Being an old stage hand. I bought it for technical details which it did not have. The story needs work and I am sure it will get better as it is shown. If you want a good adult Harry Potter play and are in the USA I suggest ""A Very Potter Musical""  (a musical with music and lyrics by Darren Criss and A.J. Holmes and a book by Matt Lang, Nick Lang and Brian Holden) It is fan based and on Youtube as of this date.
I keep thinking that this story was the British attempt at trying to be Sirius version of that work. As for the complains about JK making money. Her fan base will always be there to give money to her cause. I suggest saving it and buying a Official Lumos ‘Be the Light’ T-shirt instead.

First, I should have trusted my first instinct to not read it at all. I don't need to know what happened to the Potter gang after the war was over. It was bound to be a come down after that excitement. I don't think that Rowling should even have included the epilog that showed the heroes nineteen years later. Too much -- leave it to the readers' imaginations.

The Cursed Child reads well enough, it moves along briskly and keeps your interest. But the characters are just wrong. Harry is a bit of a loser now and Ginny is just standing by her man not really adding anything to the story. Hermione has a government job when it was clear that she would have gone into some kind of work facilitating relations between the Wizard and the Muggle worlds. And the alternate Hermione in which she does not marry Ron is straight out of It's a Wonderful Life. Remember when we realize that if Jimmy Stewart's wife never meets him she is doomed to be a lonely librarian? Horrors. Well, without Ron (not even Jimmy Stewart) Hermione is a lonely and bitter Hogwarts functionary. Grab those men while you can girls! Any man...anything's better than being single!

The original series played a huge role in my life, with the themes of friendship, teamwork, and love serving as meaningful life lessons in my teen years. The weight of the characters sacrifices, in my mind, deserves better then this cheeky script. The underlying story is a nice 'shout out' to Harry's past and the issue he's having with his son is appropriate, but the delivery itself is almost hyperbolic in a way that pokes fun at the whole thing. Especially poor Ron, whose character has clearly devolved into mere comedic relief.

Really tried, but couldn't do it","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2017","I am definitely the only person out of my group of friends who hated this book. Assuming you read the synopsis, I'll just explain my disgust:

1. I immensly dislike he main character. I've read books where villains and mean/terrible people lead the story, so I enjoy reading about a character with a few flaws or personal struggles. This one was overly pathetic. It figures this would be about a kid who doesn't compare to his dad, the great Harry Potter. Who would? It's Harry freakin Potter! There are 7 epic books about what an amazingly strong and courageous character he is! Even he started off with a few struggles before growing into the champion he was. I don't understand how this is the best plot idea that was established. Why are so many people comparing this kid to his dad? And why isn't this kid ridiculously proud of his dad? He has a sour attitude about wanting to establish a separate identity, but his actions don't reflect his wishes. Instead he just keeps brooding.

2. This could still be part of #1, but it felt to important to mesh in there. I don't like how he made me react as a reader, and I'm so mad that this kid made me think that he needed a time out. I am nobody's mother, so how dare he entice the urge to yell at him for acting so childish and disrespectful to his dad! He has a great life, with a family that loves him, so he should be more appreciative of the things he's taking for granted. This is the first time I have ever sided with a parent in a book. A parent. Now I feel old and wizened over teenaged drama. This kid is a huge jerk.

3. I completely understand that this book was not written by J.K. Rowling. I want to state that I was not expecting a similar writing style, tone of voice or even similar level of creativity. That being said, Harry, Ron and Hermione sounded absolutely nothing like Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively. I was expecting a little change since they're older, but really, these are characters who have been through a war of chaos, stress and anguish, only to grow old sounding like a group of guest stars on Sesame Street. I enjoyed the play format of the book, but with so much riding on dialogue, I was struggling to accept these as the same characters that J.K. Rowling created.

I think 2 stars is overly generous, but that's because I've probably placed my expectations a little too high to begin with.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

There, I said it. I'm very let down by this story because I assumed Rowling had actually...read it. I find it difficult to believe she would approve it because it screams fanfiction. I know because I've written plenty of Harry Potter fanfiction. Mine is more true to the heart of Harry Potter than this story is. Yes, an amateur's writing from when they were 15 years old is more palpable than this cursed child of a story.

Time travel. Why? Rowling herself said time travel opened up way too many plot holes which is why she had them destroyed in the first place.

Dues ex Machina. Everywhere! Yes, Rowling was guilty of it as well, but hers usually came from a thread of writing from 4 books before. I mean pearl powder? No. A time Turner watch? NO! Get out of here. Such convenient plot pieces.

You know who they should save instead of Diggory? Freaking Fred Weasley. Remus Lupin. Tonks. Oh and where the hell is little Teddy in this story? And the other Weasleys?

(It was that bad at first) But after the fourth time in reading it, it started to become more interesting(and bareable).I finally finished reading it all the way through.
  **SPOILERS AHEAD!!!**
When they started using timeturners and started talking about bringing back Cedric Diggory I was so dissapointed! (I thought they could do better than that! This is JKR we're talking about here! Cedric Diggory is one of the lamest characters. Sorry Hufflepuff but it is true.) They do have the kids being the heros if you like that but the parents swoop in at the end and help. The whole thing about Voldemort having a child I thought was crazy but once you get over that fact the person they pick is really cool. I thought that Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy(Draco's son) were gay, they hugged all the time but they covered it up with Scorpius liking Rose(Hermione and Ron's daughter) and Albus liking Voldemort's child.(I can't say the name that would be too much of a spoiler alert.) I didn't think it was hard reading it as a play script. It had none of the luster as the past 7. Harry was such a brat and they didn't even explain why Ron owned the Weasly's joke shop instead of George. Scorpius is such a nerd he and Rose would go well together.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Please have redone Rowling","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","Harry Potter and the cursed child was the biggest bust the Harry Potter series has ever seen. It portrayed characters we all know so well and love endlessly as different people. Ron is what basically seems like a replacement Fred. Why does Ron now run Weasley's Wizard Wheezes does he run it with George since Fred died? I guess we'll never know SINCE GEORGE IS NEVER MENTIONED!!! Hermione didn't seem right either she went from a bookish know it all to a sloppy Minister of Magic. I really want to understand that she kept the time turner for good reasons like the book said, but it simply does not seem like a Hermione thing to do. She fully understood the risks of time turners in the third Harry Potter. Why, why, why would she keep it in such a easy to get place, it seemed like it was a poorly done version of the obstacles in the way of getting to the Sorcerer's Stone in the first book. Harry seemed off as well, because you think after the experience of being an outsider in the muggle world and sometimes even at Hogwarts he would understand his son more! He even said that Albus was like him in that way at the end of the book, what took you so long to realize that Harry? This book did have great potential, but that was cut down by bad writing and the story being rushed into one 309 page book. I think this book could have been at least 4 stars had been put into a set up much like the originals. We would have seen more of Albus' struggles if the book only took place in just his first year, imagine seeing Albus go through being teased and bullied by his peers. This would have let us appreciate him more instead of him coming off as a whiney, ungrateful teen. I wanted this book to be amazing because this was going to be a book with a Slytherin main character that was not in any way a villain. This book is not that and Albus was portrayed as a weak boy who blamed all of his issues on his farther. I am disappointed because I really loved the idea of Rowling doing a book about the next generation of Harry Potter characters. It breaks my heart that I'm writing a bad review of a Harry Potter book because I practically worship J.K Rowling. This book came off as a fan fiction by someone who only watched the Harry Potter movies and doesn't know the characters at all. I really think I redo is in order because the standards that the previous 7 books set for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were not met.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_110?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=110&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am not sure who actually wrote this screen play but I doubt J.K. Rowling actually had much (if anything) to do with it.  It is written as if the author had very little to no knowledge of the characters or story lines from any of the previous books, or maybe they just saw one of the movies years ago.  The characters do and say things that they would never do in the books, and the dialog is not true to who they are in the books. The plot is confused and pointless at times. It meanders through many subplots, often does not have a foundation in the material from the original book series.  I had to force myself to keep reading this thing.

Plot holes here and there, overused tropes, and unlike the seven main series books, this was very... predictable. Even the major plot twist came as more of a disappointment than anything else. Many characters were well out of character, even considering the settings. There were a handful of good moments, and I like Scorpius' characterization overall, but any character that wasn't a main one and hadn't already been featured in the main books (read: fleshed out) came across as very two-dimensional. There were a lot of things that weren't addressed at the end that I had questions about, which left me kind of unsatisfied.

I'm sure it did well in theaters, because it does read like something that would have. That said, I feel like there should have been some effort to put it into a more prosaic format if they wanted to sell it as a book. It would have been a good bit shorter, probably, but that's how I feel about it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Knight","Curses!","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2016","Up until about halfway through this, I HATED it. I hated the plot because it seemed like such a re-hash of the original books. I hated the characters because I didn’t believe they’d act as they are portrayed (Harry Potter not understanding what it’s like to be a lonely child? Hello! He spent a good chunk of his childhood alone on Privet Drive.) I didn’t believe that Harry would be such a terrible father, that Hermoine would be so stupid (really? The location of a hidden object is revealed using riddles that two teenagers can EASILY figure out? They’re not portrayed as super intelligent and Hermoine is the brightest witch of her age!) and I didn’t believe that Draco would have remained completely unchanged after the Battle of Hogwarts.

By the time I got to the end, I was OK with this story. I don’t love it. I don’t even really like it. Draco was a much more believable character (though why the sudden change from the start of the play, I’m not sure). But I still didn’t like the way Harry was portrayed or how simply things were wrapped up…this may have something to do with my dislike of the old ‘time traveler’ plot.

Granted, the story loses something when you’re just reading the lines vs. seeing it in the theater. I’m sure the play itself is a masterpiece…and if this was considered a ‘fan’s view of what MIGHT have happened in the future’ I’d be fine with it. Even a fan’s tribute to the Potter series with Rowling’s blessing would be fine. But for Rowling to say this is the 8th ‘story’ (it’s not a novel. Not even close. If you’re expecting the old Harry Potter magic, you’re going to be disappointed.) is depressing. It’s just not worthy of the rest of the series. I’m going to do my best to forget that this story even happened. Having read this, I’m perfectly fine leaving Harry’s story at “All was well.”","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I didn't mind it being a script, but i could imagine it would be very disappointing seeing it performed.  I'm sorry, but you need all the movie special effects.  Like other reviewers, i have no idea why JK let her name be associated with  this book.  I guess it  was another step in stardom for her, to get HP on the stage. That's the only reason i can think of as this was definitely not to her level of skill. The man tried, i suppose, so marks for effort, but that's it.

Most playwrights want their shows to be produced.  I've been a member of a theatre company for 46 years as both actor and director.  The special effects required to produce this play would make it a technical nightmare and beyond the scope of most theatre companies I know., not to mention the length!

Even though it was initially advertised as another book addition of the series only 20 years later I soon found out it was a play.  I do believe there will be and have already been several fans who felt much disappointment when they found out it was actually a play.  At first I also was skeptical.  However, I am a die-hard fan like my son so he bought this one for me as a gift and I couldn't wait to open it to the adventure it would take me on.  I admit it was a bit of a setback to find it was in fact a play, however mild it was.  With that said I want to assure other die-hard fans who have yet to get the book since finding out it is a play that you will not have any trouble reading it.  Here's why:  The human mind after learning to read in it's youth stops reading a word completely and only mentally acknowledges the first and last letters of the word.  It is the same with reading all of the ""he said."" and 'she said."" because our minds already are reading along in the conversation and know who 'he' is and 'she' is so it basically skips over that and goes on to thoughts of the characters, their surroundings and what is going on in the environment they are in.  So, a play just has more dialogue between the characters than a book does and mildly throws in the environment and actions of the character and those in that particular moment.  Granted there is less to read and if you are not actually watching the play you have to use some, however little, of your imagination to get the gist of what is going on.  I assure you you will be able to read it and follow.

J. K. Rowling does not disappoint for part in this addition to the series.  For Part though.  I still had a hard time figuring out exactly who the 'Cursed Child' was, even still I'm not sure I have it right.  What I'm saying is it was never made clear.  All the previous 'Harry Potter' books in the series gave a problem to solve of which the three main characters would put their heads together and come up with a solution to defeat the villain, Voldemort.  In this play you will find you feel you are just going back and forth to the same scenes over and over with the only difference being they are in different times of their parents past.  There is a time-turner that lets them go back in time to change things for a different outcome.  No biggy right.  Not exactly.  It gets monotonous, repetitive and quite frankly boring.  Honestly, I am hoping that J. K. Rowling DID NOT write the majority of this play and maybe just put her name on it (even that's not good).  Of all the books she has written on her own, to put her name on this play just ruins her reputation as a great writer.  The premise of the story was good for sure, I just don't think there was much thought put into the actual story.  Harry Potter really only plays an itty bitty part in the whole book.  The only reasoning I can think of to even mention him is to sell more books since not many fans would go out and buy 'The Cursed Child"" without 'Harry Potter' being put on the title somewhere.

Quite honestly, I am disappointed and sort of feel cheated.  Not because it is a play but because all the other books in the series were so great while this one falls short of being just okay.

So lastly, if you are a die hard fan like myself and thinking you are going to read this fantastic 'Harry Potter' book, I would say wait till you can buy it used or just save your money and check out at the library.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Mannino","Disappointing","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2016","This play, hailed as the supposed 8th Potter story falls flat in every way:

60% spectacle
30% nostalgia
10% substance

I enjoy Potter and have been in theatre for almost my entire life. As both a Potter fan and a theatre professional, I was disappointed. The idea of putting a Potter story on stage is brilliant, and I admit I haven't seen the stage production. I'm aware there are already thousands of reviews and it's one of the bestselling books of the year, but still wanted to give my thoughts.

60% Spectacle. - Spectacle can be a wonderful thing in stage shows. When done correctly, a bit of stage magic can push a production to a new level and leave the audience amazed. An example would be Elphaba's flight at the end of Act One in ""Wicked."" The effect isn't particularly challenging, but the spectacle is completely necessary. The character embraces the role she's been assigned by others, and takes to the air singing an iconic song. The moment advances both character and plot, and fits seamlessly into the show. In contrast, the majority of this play is nothing BUT spectacle, and spectacle for spectacle's sake. I'm sure these endless effects look dazzling on the stage, but they do NOT make for good theatre. Scene after scene flies by, most of them two minutes long or shorter, giving absolutely no character or plot advancement- but showing special effects for the audience to smile at. The feeling is more like going to a theme park than living through a well-constructed play. When a show is nothing but spectacle you end up with something like Spiderman: Turn off the Dark, and the only reason this show isn't bombing is the following...

30% Nostalgia - this is the reason the show sold out, and the reason it's such a popular book. I'll admit, I had it too, while reading. All the favorite characters are there, with the exception of Dobby. Even dead characters like Snape and Dumbledore make an appearance. In addition there are scenes from the books played out in this play- such as when Hagrid brings Harry the cake (a dream sequence). The play's crammed with nostalgic moments, and there's nothing wrong with that, except Cursed Child never moves past the nostalgia phase.

10% Substance- there's very little story here, and the story itself is extremely weak. It's a time-travel story, focused on the effects of what happens if some events in the stories, particularly book four, are changed. Each of the seven novels brings us deeper into a new aspect of the Wizarding World- new places, new ideas, new characters. That's what I looked forward to the most. There are almost NO new ideas in this story at all. Showing the world as if Voldemort had won was interesting for moment, but it didn't make up for the lack of substance in this story. The back and forth time-jumping was weak, the characters of Harry and Draco's sons not particularly innovative, and the entire story just felt flat. The ""substance"" of Cursed Child honestly felt more like a fanfic homage to the series. At the same time, both the spectacle and nostalgia remain paramount- let's watch Draco and Harry fight with wands and fly across the stage, let's see dementors suck souls- and look here's Bane- no reason for him to be here, but isn't it great to see him... you get the idea.

Overall, I'm not rushing to see this play onstage, and found this entire story lackluster. I hope the movies coming out are better, but honestly my expectations are low.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I DESPISE Ginny (she is worse than Umbridge in my book) so I like to pretend Harry's life with her never actually happened. Hence the reason why I was excited to be back in the Harry Potter world, but I knew I wouldn't end up loving this story about Harry and Ginny.

Going into reading this book, I knew I probably wouldn't be thrilled with the plot, so I tried not to take that into consideration very much in my critique. Different strokes for different folks, you know? Just because I don't like the plot of a book doesn't mean it's a bad book.

Well...except in this case...

First of all, the plot was about a million times worse than I ever imagined. So ridiculous. But even disregarding the general plot, this book was awful. Really, truly, and very unfortunately, awful. I'm sure you have heard the same things over and over again, but there were so many things wrong with this book. The characters were NOTHING like they were in the rest of the Harry Potter series. Yes, people change as they age, but not like that. I am trying to keep this discussion spoiler free, but if you have read Cursed Child, I'm sure you can think of multiple examples. There were also huge changes to the world and magic system that J.K. Rowling created. And honestly, it felt like these changes were made just because it made the plot fall into place easier. What a cop out for the sake of convenience.

I could talk more about all the little intricacies of this script that bugged the hell out of me, but the internet is swarming with these types of discussions and I don't want to get myself all worked up over it. Let's talk instead about my biggest problem with this script. The writing was HORRIBLE. Yes, I understand that reading a script is different than reading a novel. But there are many plays that I adore and have read multiple times. This. Writing. Was. Awful. The stage directions were nonexistent, the plot was WAY too convenient, the characters were flat and dull and absolutely obnoxiously stupid, and I therefore spent about 90% of my time reading alternating between confused, bored, and angry.

Honestly, there is SO MUCH that is wrong with this work. But I truly don't want to talk about it anymore. Like so many people, Harry Potter means the world to me. It breaks my heart that this awful thing now exists and is supposed to be considered an ""eighth story."" I don't want to discuss my dislike of this book anymore because I want to forget as much as I can as quickly as possible. It has left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't want my Harry Potter love tainted by it. I'm honestly so confused as to how J.K. Rowling could sign off on this idea. After all that she has created, it seems so strange that she would let it be muddled by Jack Thorne and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Play.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In the series, J.K. Rowling draws readers in with her descriptive imagery and character development. If you read the books before watching the movies, I'm sure you experienced that moment of ""Wow! That character came to life on screen exactly as I imagined."" This new expansion of the Harry Potter series completely lacks the magic of the original seven books; there is neither imagery nor character development. Albums Severus's problems seem like the trivial banalities teenagers often feel during their adolescent years. The original characters seem at odds with their book descriptions -- Harry is weak-minded, Ron a ""hilarious"" jokester, and Hermione's spells were unable to keep out a few teenagers?

The character I most enjoyed was that of Scorpius Malfoy, as it seems that the writers put most of their character development into his persona. Also, the idea of Hermione as the Minister of Magic was smart, but poorly executed and underdeveloped.

I agree with many others that this does not read like a storyline written by J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling's words brought magic into the homes of people all over the world. In this story the magic falls flat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_110?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=110&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This series helped me through my roughest moments growing up, and I reread them constantly while awaiting the next volume.  So, I'm going to be the first person to say that I had HIGH expectations for this volume.

No spoiler spoilers, but I will be talking vaguely about the plot and characters.

I have decided to mentally file this story under interesting, but not believable fan fiction.  I just didn't believe the characters: Ron was too stupid, Draco was too mellow, Hermione and Ginny (and McGonagall in one memorable instance) were not assertive or sassy enough, and Harry and Hermione (and the character with whom Albus and Scorpius are obsessed) made some decisions that I just don't believe they would have ever made.  Some skilled actors MIGHT be able to pull this off, but it really did not read in the script.  Without that core of believable characters, the story fell apart for me.

Plot elements feel rather contrived as well--the villain (who was disappointingly obvious), the time travel.  In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, time travel was handled brilliantly because both timelines worked simultaneously and fit perfectly.  While I like the idea of exploring the effects of one person's decisions, and some of the effects were definitely interesting to read about, this angle has been done and this version of time travel tarnishes the magic of Azkaban for me.

Also, Rowling's strength is description, so I'm not sure a script is the best media for her to use to tell a story.  I'm now a bit worried about Fantastic Beasts.

There were elements of the plays that I liked.  Scorpius is ADORABLE, and Albus and Scorpius' friendship is fun to read about.  They will be staying in my head cannon even if most of this play is not.  I also really liked the idea of Harry's fame being difficult for Albus to deal with and this causing tension between father and son.  In spite of the fact that I don't find all Harry's reactions believable, the relationship was interesting and often touching.  The part of the story that featured Scorpius on his own was fun to read and was probably the best part of the plays (for all my earlier complaints about time travel).  The scene with Hagrid towards the end made me cry.

All in all, I am disappointed, and I will, overall, be pretending this play is not sanctioned by Rowling.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I'm battling with whether I should be disappointed or just accept this for what it is...but, no, I'm disappointed. Mostly I'm disappointed that JK Rowling allowed this to be published. I can imagine that this would be a good, fun and well produced, spin off play but publishing the script is unnecessary and feels like a sad attempt to cash-in.
JK is such a masterful author, she creates the most incredible, vivid alternate word and does this through wonderful prose and lengthy descriptions which the reader gets lost in. This play, in contrast, feels thin, rushed and flimsy. The characters Ron, Hermione and Harry feel like caricatures and, aside from Scorpius, the new characters we meet are underdeveloped and two dimensional.
There are grammatical errors throughout - I know it's a play but this is still unacceptable!Without pulling this apart for the sake of it there were also a few parts of this story which didn't sit right or seem feasible (I'm sure they can be explained though).
- Why is it so easy for Albus and Scorpius to cast spells on Cedric at the Tri Wizard tournament? Wouldn't all of the opposite teams be doing this to help their representatives all of the way through?
- How is Delphi able to spend so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only allows 5 minutes?
 - I just hate the scene where Harry and Dumbledore had their heart to heart and tell each other they love one another.

This shouldn't have been published; rather just left as a spin off play for people to enjoy and take for what it is.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

My biggest negative after reading this as a Harry Potter fan was that the dialogue of the returning Harry Potter characters (Harry, Hermoine, Ron, etc.) felt very unnatural to the characters from the original series. I understand that Harry is now in his late 30s, early 40s in this play but there were times when I was reading his lines, and other returning characters' lines, where it just felt like that isn't something that character would say. There was also some dialogue that was really ""cheesy"" and felt like the writer was trying to force a laugh which made the line seem unnatural.

It is also missing the descriptive quality that made the original series so good, I understand it's a play and that quality would be lacking a bit but it was almost entirely absent in the scene descriptions.

The story line was pretty predictable (even the ""twist"" at the end was predictable) and was used much more effectively in other movies that had used it before.

I hope this review helps and I didn't spoil anything. I think any Harry Potter fan will check this out regardless of the reviews, as I did. But, if you're new to the Harry Potter series please read the original series and don't make this your first impression of Harry Potter.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I love Harry Potter and the world that Rowling has made.  I have been an overly obsessed fan since I was 12 yrs old and got the first book for Christmas.  That was 18 years ago and Harry, the Weasley's, Hermione, Luna, and so many more characters have been my best friends ever since.

I knew it was a play, and have no problems over looking the lack of narrative and reading the lines of my favorite people.  Unfortunately they weren't there.  This is less than a shell of the Harry Potter I know and love.  I feel that this was a failed attempt to move along a story that would have been best left in the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. I was fine with knowing that Harry and friend were okay, and the wizarding world was a better place because of the sacrifices of the characters we loved. In my opinion this play makes a mockery of the seven books and the story that Rowling told she should have never allowed these play writers to even imagine different possibilities for the story that she wrote. I don't know what else to say without spoiling the plot, bottom line this was a complete disappointment!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

This book left me feeling flat. It was kinda like eating unseasoned chicken; edible but blah. Seeing as it’s a script as opposed to an actual novel, l was prepared for it to be lacking J.K.’s masterful descriptive language but I was still expecting a well-developed plot and characters that stayed true to their origins. (One tiny non-spoilery example is Cedric becoming a Deatheater because he was embarrassed. C’mon, really? I don’t think so.) I don’t think anyone else has the ability to write these characters and I have a feeling that any contribution Rowling made to this book were minuscule.

I knew full well that this was merely a script and not a full-blown story. I'm totally fine with that..except for the fact that it's terrible.

*possible spoilers*

The initial excitement of holding a new HP book wore off incredibly quickly. The characters in CC have almost no semblance whatsoever to their true HP counterparts. They are flat and dull in so many ways.

And what's with the relationship between Scorpius and Albus? I fully expected this to turn into a full-blown romantic relationship because they reiterate their feelings for one another over...and over...and over...But it doesn't really add anything to the plot when they do!

Speaking of plot...this one is terrible! Time travel, angsty teenage drama, more time travel, random daughter of Voldemort, more time travel...There are more holes in this plot than a cheese grater!

Ugh..I have read the original HP series through many times, and will continue to do so. But this book will never be reread. I will likely give it away or give it to Goodwill as soon as my wife finishes reading it..Disappointing.

Like most people that probably bought this book, I grew up on the Harry Potter stories.  When I first heard a continuation to the series was coming out, I was excited.  I thought we would finally get the ending that the Harry Potter series deserved; I honestly did not think anything could be worse than the rushed epilogue of ""The Deathly Hollows""....I was wrong.
 I tried to be objective going into this book.  Honestly, while I have reread all the books multiple times and have  seen all the movies, I would not consider myself one of the many rabid  Harry Potter fans.  I recognized this was an adaptation to the story, so I was not looking for continuation errors.  It did not bother me that details in the books were overlooked and missing in ""The Cursed Child"".  It did not bother me that they made the Trolley Witch bonkers and Harry Potter's kid obnoxious.  What bothered me is they murdered the characters that made the Harry Potter stories great. It's a sad day when Draco Malfoy is the only decent original character in the story.
 Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione where nothing like the characters in the original books. The heart of the original stories failed to be transmitted into ""The Cursed Child"".  There was nothing about any of the characters that made you love them, root for them, or even wish them dead.  The dialog was forced and one-dimensional. While the Harry Potter series were technically children/young adult novels, this story, above all the others, felt like it was truly geared towards young children. It was cheesy line after cheesy line, cliché after cliché.  By the end, I was even okay with the bad guys  winning - at least then, the story may have some oomph behind it.  But alas, the book managed to go all the way to the end without any redeeming characteristics.  The only reason I did not give this a one-star is it has the potential for actors to break the one-dimensionality of this script in a live production.  As written, this should have just been a free read online.  But, hey, anything for a more $$$, right?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

In fact, to be honest, I didn’t hardly read it at all. So much of the storyline just felt like a cop-out in that they took whole scenes from J.K. Rowling’s books and reorganized them for the play. I didn’t like reading this in script format, it just didn’t fit the imagery behind Rowling’s Harry Potter. I’m curious about the live performance, but otherwise this story is dead to me.

Digital books are easier to store and a lot of time they're cheaper too.
When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I thought about getting a hard copy...I love the Harry Potter series and what better way to celebrate the new story than to buy a book that I can display on my shelf? But old habits die hard and I got the ebook instead.
Halfway through the Cursed Child, I became terrified that Rowling would release a new edition of the Deathly Hallows (my favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite books ever). Being a Star Wars fan as well as a Harry Potter fan, I'm well aware of the tendency to change the older, more beloved stories to fit the ""new stuff"" instead of taking care to make sure the new stuff doesn't contradict the real story--and I don't want my Deathly Hallows changed, thank you very much. It's Harry and not Ginny who tells Albus that ""He likes a laugh, your brother"". I know kindle periodically sends out updates to books and what if one day I accidentally hit a button and my Deathly Hallows gets ""updated""? What if Harry isn't a good father in my epilogue anymore?
Having worked myself up into a complete panic, I hurried to Amazon and bought myself a paper copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There. Now the story will always end like it's supposed to: Harry's a great dad and his scar doesn't hurt. You'll have to break into my house and vandalize my beloved book before that changes.

In the interest of fairness, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Scorpious Malfoy and had the play followed his schooldays' adventures with Albus Potter, I would have willingly purchased a paper copy of that story...instead of whatever it was the play actually was. It wasn't just that I didn't like how much it changed things and characters, the script just really didn't hold my attention. I kept drifting off while reading (and I used to read Shakespeare's play scripts as a child, so it wasn't the format that bored me). It just...wasn't good and wasn't Harry Potter.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was very much looking forward to ""Book 8"" to see what new adventure would add to the rich mythology of the Wizarding World. Unfortunately there is no new ground plowed and most of the plot elements are just a rehash of the previous books. Here is the plot summary - Albus and Scorpius use a time turner (a la Azkaban) to go back in time to ""fix"" the past (save Cedric Diggory). They end up messing up the present which becomes worse and so they go back in time to undo what they did and so the present ends up like it was at the beginning of the story. In the mean time, Voldemort's daughter goes back in time to ""save"" him from trying to kill baby Harry, so the main characters have to go back in time to stop Voldemort's daughter, which also ends up keeping the present time as is. That's basically it. (How Voldemort and Bellatrix have a baby before the Battle of Hogwarts is a mystery). This story does very  little to expand Harry's story or the Wizarding World. (For much of the book, Harry's story is how his fathering skills have been lacking.) Most of our favorite characters are brought back - Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, McGonagall, Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid, Umbridge, etc. The children visit the three events of the Triwizard Tournament from Goblet of Fire. Time turners play a major role - nothing new there either. The children use polyjuice potion to plan a heist at the Ministry of Magic (a la Deathly Hallows) to steal the time turner from Hermione's office. I could go on, but in short, none of this is inventive. If Rowling really wrote this story, then there was very little effort involved since this turns out to be more of a ""best of hits"" from the seven books. One of the greatest stories every written simply deserves far more than this. Rowling displayed extraordinary world building in the past, but that is absent here. I have no doubt that the London play is an ""astonishing"" feat, but the story itself falls woefully short of the first seven Harry Potter books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

There was so much potential. This just comes off as fan fiction. I understand that this is the script for a play, but the things that I didn't like are basic story elements. Those elements might be covered up by glitz and explosions when you see it on stage, but they were my biggest grievance.

I do not like how time travel is used in this book. Time travel was done so well in the Harry Potter series. The rules introduced here seem so arbitrary and don't make sense. It seems more like a way to show scenes and characters that the audience will enjoy.

The tacked on romance at the end is so stupid. The Harry Potter series gets flack for the relationships set up late in the series, but Rowling did an excellent job of writing friendship. This book is the opposite. It writes a budding romantic relationship so well, but it calls it just a friendship in the end.

There are good things this book did. Slytherin was shown in a different light. Complexities of adulthood and the difficulties of parenthood were shown well.

I wanted so much from this book so maybe I am being unfair in my critique, but I give this book a 2/5. I absolutely want to see this play.

I've never been disappointed in anything with Jo Rowling's name on it, until now.

The best I can say is that I am glad I have it so I'm not missing a piece of the HP collection.

Yankee","OK story but a shallow and cheap knockoff of the real thing","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2017","OK story but a shallow and cheap knockoff of the real thing

Other reviewers have covered the plot and its deficiencies very well so I won't repeat it all. Let me just say that as a big fan of the Potter books, I was disappointed by this book. The story is just OK - interesting enough to hold your attention but not what I would consider a ""real page turner"". There are about 10,000 plot holes though so it's best not to think too much as you read. The story also moves along at a hurricane pace - too fast for anything other than briefly glimpsed scene that lack detail. People who loved the rich detail and depth in the 600+ page novels will notice the almost complete lack of it in this book. I guess that's because this is a play and not a novel.

What disappointed me the most however was that the main figures acted in ways that seemed to me to be completely out of character. Yes, they had the same familiar names - Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Ginny, Snape - but it was if the writer(s) of this play never bothered to get to know the characters from reading the novels and instead relied on a very brief, very shallow summary/description of them. Consider this scene set in the Hogwarts Headmistress's office (Act 2, scene 3):

(Suddenly there is another rumble in the chimney and DRACO comes down hard, surrounded by cascading soot and dust)

DRACO: Sorry about your floor, Minerva.

Putting aside for a moment the plot hole of the floo network being connected to Hogwarts, can anyone who has read the Potter novels ever imagine Draco Malfoy apologizing for dirtying a floor?! If he was going to say anything, it would be some loud complaint about the dirt and soot on his clothes!

And then, perhaps even more unimaginable is that he calls Prof. McGonagall by her first name!! Not ""Professor"" or ""Headmistress"", but “Minerva"" as if they are equals!

Impossible! Completely out of character!

Draco also becomes deeply reflective and thoughtful about his relationships with his wife, father and son and provides deep psychological insight to Harry regarding Harry's troubled relationship with his own son - about two seconds after he and Harry fired off a bunch of curses at each other.  Again, it's completely unbelievable because it's so out of character. Yes, Draco did change at the end of the novels and he would have changed and matured more in the years since, but it's like he's a totally different person in this story.

Snape's brief appearance also doesn't ring true. He goes from being his usual suspicious self to being an enthusiastic (can anyone imagine Snape being enthusiastic?) eager-beaver, willing to accept what appears to be a completely outlandish story form a kid he's never seen before. Again, uncharacteristic and unbelievable.

Ginny and Ron are total Caricatures; almost totally unlike the people we know and love from the books.

For me, this is a story with characters that have the same names and some of the same characteristics as those in the novels, so I guess that technically makes this a ""Harry Potter story"". However it sure doesn't feel like one and I can’t help but wonder just how much J.K. Rowling was involved in writing it (not much, I bet).  It’s more like a cheap imitation knockoff. And that’s too bad because a well-written story of Harry and Co.’s post-Hogwarts years would be most welcome.

So read it because it’s more Harry Potter, but don’t expect too much from it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But far worse than the tin-ear writing, for me, was the insultingly sloppy plotting. Too many holes to count. So a reasonably adept wizard can simply ""make"" a time turner?

It was a nice read.
I enjoyed the Potter/Malfoy boys and how the scenes were set up, especially in part one.
I'm sure it is STUNNING on stage. I have no idea how they are going to do this. We're talking about magical creatures, onstage transfiguration, the lake, Hogwarts express. Will make for an extraordinary play with a $20M budget or really bad low budget community theatre.

Cons:
It's basically fan fiction. There are so many magical inaccuracies and character flubs that I'd be surprised if JK Rowling even proof read it before allowing her name to be on it.

I found many parts to be cheesy and the antagonist to be predictable and not well developed.

Should you read it? Sure. But don't expect JK Rowling's work. Expect a fan fiction piece that is incredibly inaccurate and makes its' own rules.

****Spoilers****
***Only read on if you are not planning on reading/seeing the play***

Here are some of the character and magical inaccuracies:

-Polyjuice potions are whipped up in a second.
-How time traveling works with a time turner is different than the books. In the books you go back and do what you have already done. Time and events are written. But the play suggests the ripple effect and alternative futures.
-Harry and Draco call each other by their first names, even when arguing (seriously, when has this ever happened??)
-The author suggests that Hermione's career and life would have been in the toilet without Ron (we know she is a stronger woman than that). Also suggests that Hermione views men as inferior to women. It's in a riddle - ""a disease of the egg, the less fair of those who walk on two legs"". Answer is men. An awful way to paint Hermione. I'm sure she's much more of a true feminist than that.
-The author suggests Cedric may have gone to Voldemort's side after a single bad experience. We know that Cedric is better than this.
-Human transfiguration happens. Why did we ever need polyjuice?
-If memory serves me, the books ended with a decent, respectful relationships between the centaurs and residents of Hogwarts. Not the case in the play.
-Voldemort had a child. I honestly don't see him putting the moves on anyone. Also, I don't think he would have wanted a child. Some people have children because they fear their own mortality. Okay, but he had Horcruxes and other ways to help him potentially live forever. A child may have also challenged him in the future. JK Rowling may feel different, but we may never know because she wasn't the one who wrote this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_94?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=94&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am thinking.

Where to begin?

Hmm... ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" is the script to a play based on a story by J.K. Rowling. It begins during the epilogue of Book 7 so the gang is now all grown up and ready to pass the torch to the next generation. Therefore, while the old gang is featured throughout the play, the story focuses more around Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, Harry and Draco's kids, respectively.

Let's get something out of the way first. I don't particularly mind this being a script to a play rather than a book. Would I prefer a book? Sure, absolutely, but my preference is usually the conversations between characters anyway. In that respect, I wasn't looking for lush descriptions of our surroundings or of how the characters are feeling, etc. My imagination and memory of this world will suffice.

Having said that, it doesn't bode well when only minutes into the script I find myself taking down notes instead of enjoying the story (something I've never done with any of the Harry Potter books). This is something that happened constantly throughout the earlier chapters of Cursed Child and I could hardly stop myself. Characters were acting in ways that made no sense, sometimes being spiteful just because to the point of they being downright unlikable. In short, they weren't acting like human beings should act, age notwithstanding. The source of the problem, as far as I can tell, is time.

Simply put, we don't know any of these characters, not even Harry, Ron, Hermione, et al. I mean, it's been almost twenty years since the Battle of Hogwarts and a lot has happened since then. The epilogue at the end of Book 7 works, for the most part, because it's short, and the characters appear to act as we remember them to. However, in Cursed Child we spend more time with them, and the more I read the less I connected with these characters. To further compound the problem, the events in Cursed Child develop over four (if I recall correctly) years but in the span of 300 pages (about the same length as Azkaban), whereas Harry had 1 book for each year. Consequently we're given glimpses into the lives of these characters and, in order to reinforce them, the script plays the ""tell, don't show"" card to an untenable degree, almost as if someone were shouting, ""DO YOU GET IT NOW?!""

I do get it, Cursed Child doesn't have enough room to breathe life into its characters and it suffers for it. It tries to redeem itself a bit as we approach the final acts but most of the damage has already been done by that point.

It's time I addressed the plot. Personally, I found it to be pretty absurd, unfortunately bordering (if not outright crossing into) fanfiction territory, a bad to average one. Very early on a character says something that made me think, ""This can be easily verified in our world. Wait, this character should know that!!!"" The catalyst that prompts Albus' and Scorpius' adventure is... I don't know, that somebody wrote it that way I suppose. A prophecy is put into play, a laughable one. A character is introduced, again, straight out of someone's fanfic I guess. The only thing remotely engaging about the plot is that it explores the question of ""what if?"" to varying degrees of success, placing familiar characters in unfamiliar circumstances. Unfortunately though, it is also one of its weaknesses as it really does come across as a remix of (some) of Harry Potter's greatest hits, as others have suggested. To top it all, the story's more engaging when it only features half of the dynamic duo (I'll let you guess which one. Hint: his name starts with Scorpius).

If the story had continued the way it started, I would've given it a 1/5 without a shadow of a doubt. However, it is salvaged by the fact that the characters start resembling human beings later on (though I still feel they dropped the ball here) and that the Malfoys, Scorpius in particular, do their best to slap some sense into the rest of the cast and get this story back on track. Thus, my rating stands at a 2-ish/5, it was okay-ish (barely scraping that 2). I fail to understand why this story even needed to be told.

Fortunately, I had the good sense of buying it on Kindle because, to be honest, I don't know if I want the hardcover standing next to my Harry Potter books. That privilege needs to be earned and ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" has failed to earn it.

Why I did not enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child

(Fans, especially Hufflepuffs with blind loyalty, this is a logical argument against the book/play.  If you want to argue, don’t.  If you want to be overly emotional, don’t.  If you want to point out the correct logic or mistakes I have made, please do.  I want to view this book/play in a better light.  Below are my disagreements, acknowledgements, and theories.  Do not be mean or blind.  Be kind and logical.)

In my opinion, this play was poorly written.  The dialogue was off and all over the place, poorly worded, out of logic.  Characters from the books did not resemble themselves.  There were major plot holes, the story moved to fast.  Characters like Ron, and Hermione were stereotyped, and more than likely, based off the movies.  The entire read was like a hashing of previous events in the Potter books, and that characters from the original books were inspired more from the movies.
This is a play.  When reading it, I tried to imagine it as a play and it was difficult to do.  The wording and story were very different and disconnected from the original series.  Below are my disagreements and my agreements for the play.  As bad as it was, there were some incredibly great parts to the story, but there was a lot wrong with connecting it to Harry Potter, in my opinion.
J.K. Rowling has been seeing, this is the end of Harry Potter.  Why?  If the books encouraged people to read (I would not have enjoyed reading if it were not for Harry Potter, seriously), have driven the world economy, and provided funds to charitable organizations, would she stop writing?  I do not know why she has stopped the series, when it creates open mindedness (as has been studied and proven by scholars) in current culture and a good social critique on today’s society.  Here is my likes and dislikes for the new play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

**********Spoiler Alert**********************************************************
What I did not like about the story in regards to it being published.  It was definitely not written by J.K. Rowling.  I understand that this was to be expected, but why list her as an author on the published play if she did not write it?  (J.K Rowling is legitimately listed as an author for this “book.”)  Of course she contributed ideas and created the fictional world and parameters, and approved the story, yet she is not the author.  Rowling’s name was just a money maker, and fan attraction.  It was her stamp of approval for this to be Harry Potter canon.  Jack Thorne and John Tiffany wrote the play and you can definitely read the difference between the dialogue from the books and the new play.  Fans will quickly defend Rowling for this story, but it was not Rowling’s, this is a Thorne and Tiffany story.  Fandom is a little too strong here in which there seems to be a doublethink (“it was okay, it’s Harry Potter at least, but is not Harry Potter, it is canon though, it was not that bad, it was okay”) situation when it comes to this new addition to the story.  This situation is further seen by the lack of agreement of whether the play is canon or fanfiction.  Most try to say it is both, but it definitely is not canon beyond the few elements that are definitely Rowling contributed (which can easily be determined while reading).

Alright, problems with the actual story.  Hermione Granger is offending.  For one of the brightest characters of the original books, Thorne and Tiffany really made her seem terribly dumb as an adult.  Why?  In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Hermione, with the help of Ron and Harry, break into the Ministry of Magic.  Now, as Minister for Magic, is Hermione really daft enough to let security be dogmatic since her teenage years?  That two 14 year olds, 22 years later, can break into the government building, with the same potion, and break into her office with a first year spell, “Alohomora.”  Now, alternate universe, if Hermione was never with Ron, or Krum, would she really be a miserable shrew?  No.  This is my opinion, I am biased with this so it is speculation on my part.  Why does Hermione need to be in a relationship to be okay?  Next universe, was it okay for Hermione to rebel against a fascist regime, yeah, but being a sexy rebel?  Why was it necessary for Hermione to be characterized as a sexy rebel?  This did not make any sense, it felt totally out of place.  Is being rebellious sexy? (Or just popular, “’I rebel,’ said Katniss.” Divergent.)

Another dislike, Harry Potter’s duel with Draco Malfoy.  Harry Potter, Head of Magical Law Enforcement, who earlier in the story, is cut up from dueling and arresting another wizard, has trouble dueling Malfoy, Malfoy claiming that Harry is getting older.  Would not Harry’s power skill have increased with his experience with Magical Law Enforcement?  Harry is around 40 years old.  Albus Dumbledore was powerful at over a 100 years of age.  Yeah, perhaps Malfoy has become powerful, but not knowing his career, and learning that Harry is in the major leagues for defensive and offensive spells makes me question the entire cliché dialogued fight scene.

Another issue, Scorpius Malfoy’s and Albus Potter’s wands are broken by Delphi (funny metaphor, see theories).  Cool.  How does Albus’ wand “magically” return in the end for him to use to help defeat Delphi?  (“I love magic.”)

Time-Turners?  Okay, Rowling admitted that this idea was a poor one to include in her stories (it has been reported that she has even deleted her comment about this from her website).  Now, we are brought back to this.  In The Prisoner of Azkaban, time travel seems to be a difficult affair, now it is an easy avenue, easy as pressing a button, and swoosh, no other detail needed, you are transported to the moment you needed to get to.  Would it really be that easy?  And would it be that easy, and make sense that Draco Malfoy had purchased another Time-Turner and bring it out into the open (“in time”) to save Albus and Scorpius?  (Oh man, I hear a knock, I think somebody left Deus in the machina again.)  This was a really poor moment.  Yeah, there could be an argument here in that Malfoy really did not want to be thought of with dealing with time travel, especially with the “rumors” about his son, but this is a good structure, but a bad plot device.

Literature alert.  Why is the stage direction cues listed with complex vocabulary that do not aid the story?  Adding a word that most of the audience would not know is ridiculous in pop culture when not trying to make a point, especially as it is a play script where stage direction is meant to be prompt and short.  Fans argue that the story is a play that it should not be taken seriously as a book.  I agree, yet there are issues with the paly itself when they use bookish ideas within play styled writing.  Fellow fans, (with the loyalty of Hufflepuff House) quit switching sides between book and play defenses, I know and considered this as a play.

What I did enjoy.
As much as I disagreed with the story, there were elements that I liked.  Albus Potter being sorted into Slytherin opened the door to great possibilities.  Being friends with Scorpius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy’s son, is another great addition to the story, it really shows that time had changed and old childish feuds are gone.  Amazing ideas for the new Harry Potter.  Another great idea, Snape learning that he was a hero.  This was a great idea, the execution of it was not precisely well done, but having Snape get to learn that he was appreciated was a bit of a satisfying ending (Like Van Gogh finding out he is popular after death).  Overall, the friendship between Slytherins, Albus and Scorpius, is awesome and it really well transitioned the story from books to play.

Alright, theories.
I do have further theories, but I do not fully consider them true, only thoughts of possible aims of the story.

Who exactly was cursed?  This is complete speculation, but my guess is Albus Potter.  What is the curse?  Homosexuality.  There is an odd mixture between Albus and Scorpius that brought this to my attention.  The stage directions mention awkward hugs.  Albus and Scorpius only spend time with each other, have a difficult time finding other friends, and wanting to play sports.  Malfoy is worried because there are “rumors” about his son.  Reading in between the lines, it would seem that the characters are gay.  This is further compounded by the idea of the father and son issues.  Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter are able to bond in regards to the father and son issues they have been having.  Their sons do not have enough friends, do not play sports, and are not matching their fathers’ identities or wishes.  This conflict suggests fathers who are trying to live through their sons, or fathers that are disappointed with their sons’ sexual maturity.  There is no real explanation for the idea of a “curse,” whether it is Harry Potter’s post trauma or Delphi’s introduction as a new evil.  Who is cursed?  Perhaps the curse is when Harry admits his disappointment with his son, or the curse is compounded with the previous in that Harry is disappointed, because his son does not match his viewpoint, that his son is a homosexual.  It could be argued that Albus and Scorpius are romantically attracted to other girls/women.  Scorpius and Rose, Albus and Delphi, but is it not taken seriously.  Scorpius gets jealous (okay, okay, perhaps as a friend) of Albus’ attraction to Delphi, and Scorpius never really goes after Rose in serious application.  By the end of the story, Albus and Harry have that kind of talk, where the idea is not really worked out, and feel as though that Albus still is not okay with Harry and that he has not fully understood himself after everything he hads been through (maybe not even his attraction to Delphi).  Scorpius easily reminds one of Oscar Wilde, funny, social (mostly with Albus), and perhaps bisexual, homosexual.
Now, politics.  I am not going to argue about homosexuality, religiously or politically.  Intelligence, book/play reading people are usually intelligent.  Let us be intelligent here.  Do not argue about your thoughts on the subject.  I am writing this to figure out the possible ideas of the story.  No one needs irreverent or irrelevant comments.  J. K. Rowling’s work has been a social critique on the closed minded ideas of current and past cultures, especially when most think of fascism with Voldemort’s regime, and anti-muggle sentiments.  It seems that this play is another social critique, the difficulty for fathers to accept their sons for who they are, especially in times when homosexuality is discussed more and more, and the discontent of fathers has been an old subject.  I feel that this idea was a great idea for the play, if it was intended as a theme.  It was probably the best part of the story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I am an avid HP fan -- I gladly plunked down my hard-earned cash for the hardback book each time a new novel was released. I own all of the books in hardback, Kindle and CD (Jim Dale ROCKS!) and all of the additional books, as well as all of the movies. And I watch, read and listen to them regularly. It isn't just about the simple story line. It was about the symbolism, the mythology, the nuances, the multiple threads, the details that spanned the books from beginning to end and an impoverished single mum who pulled herself out of poverty by her pen.  Suffice it to say, I know this story forwards and backwards. This? Well, I preordered it and didn't have huge expectations (but certainly higher than Snape's expectations of liking Harry). It's a good thing I kept them low, because the end product certainly failed to impress. I can only imagine the disappointment of those who were as excited to get it as Dobby is when he gets Christmas socks from Harry.

As a writer, I have done my fair share of ghostwriting. This feels like a clunky ghostwritten project. JKR may have created the story, which has the potential to be brilliant in novel form. But, the playwrights let it fall flatter than the golden chair Hagrid broke at the wedding in book 7. I read it as one should read a play -- imagining staging, timing, costuming, lighting, etc. The story is incredibly linear (which kind of makes sense given how the story plays with time). The characters are wooden (even the Golden Trio come across as droll). I wondered more than once if there was a LGBT agenda woven into the character development of the two young protagonists (a nod to the Dumbledore-Grindelwald relationship perhaps?). Connections are dropped left and right. Seriously, the storyline feels like a leaky cauldron -- details and continuity are leaking out everywhere. Meanwhile, the first scenes are very fast and disjointed, which I understand if you want to quickly portray the passage of time, but unless the staging is amazing, I doubt anyone but avid fans will understand what's going on. I will say this -- if they are able to pull off the ""magic"" on stage, that would be very, very cool to see.

This is not a stand-alone work of fiction. If you aren't familiar with the characters and also Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you're going to be lost.

I hope this is released in novel form ... and that JKR plays a much bigger role in its creation and editing. Several friends have asked if I'll read this play again. Maybe ... if I have three hours to waste. Will I see the plays? Likely, but I'll likely wait until the production comes to the United States. While I love visiting London (and the HP studios and Platform 9 3/4), this isn't worth a dedicated trip across the Pond. Would I watch it in a movie form? Yes, but like I said, I'm an avid fan ... and I can only hope that the novel and movie versions, if they are created, will be better than this iteration. Here's hoping Fantastic Beasts is better than this!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

K. Rowling involved at all in this book? Although touted as the 8th installment of the tale, I found little in this play of the original feel of the Harry Potter franchise.

First off, I don't care for reading plays. Yes, I knew this was a play when I picked it up, but that fact was mitigated by it's being about freakin' Harry Potter!

Unfortunately, the Harry of this play bears no resemblance to the brave young man who faced the world's most evil wizard and prevailed. He seems to be more concerned about his image than his family. Although he is obviously still in love with Ginny, he pays little attention to the feelings and insecurities of his son, Albus. Poor parenting, Harry.

The close bond between Harry, Hermione and Ron is almost nonexistent in this story. Hermione is now the Minister of Magic and is not above keeping some pretty important matters secret, sparking the disaster can destroy their world. Ron is rarely heard from, and when he does appear it's to make inane jokes and provide no assistance to his former friend, or his wife for that matter. Also, Ron is no longer an Auror; he now runs the joke shop. What? Where's George? For that matter, where are any of the other Weasleys?

The clever banter and magical creatures of the original series are also missing. Much of the fun of the books is in Ms. Rowling's sense of humor and imagination. Both are noticeably absent in the play.

I had hoped that the series could carry on in the same spirit that made Harry Potter the most popular children's character ever. Alas, this appears to be a vehicle to make money for the co-authors. A huge disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First of all, let me preface with my own admission that I know this is the wromg medium for consuming the story. This was written for a play, and one will not absorb the entire story simply by reading the script once through. I have not seen the play. I will not be able to grasp the nuances of the detail and deep emotions JK Rowling was able to deliver in her book. To fully appreciate the story, you should watch the play and/ or study the script properly. I have not done that, but I am also not holding it against this format by giving a lower rating due to this. No, I am simply rating based on the story. BTW, yes I am a big time Harry Potter fan. Have been since the very beginning like most of you. The wizarding world of Harry Potter is very special to me, and this breaks my heart a little.

Spoilers from here on:

I think calling it a cheap fan fic is a little harsh, there was some good and some bad... mostly bad. I do not like the fact that Ron seems like a former shell of himself. The book makes it seem like Harry did everything, and glosses over what Hermione and Ron and everyone else did. Ron and Hermoine's daughter seems like a shallow brat, she doesn't even like Scorpius/ Albus until after they have done something heroic. She seems obsessed with status, the opposite of what Ron and Hermione would have raised their daughter to be.

The part about the polyjuive potion was absurd. How does the Ministry not have detection mechanisms for that after what Harry, Ron and Hermione pulled in The Deathly Hallows? I mean, yes... Voldermort having a child makes me want to kick a duck, but everyone's already mentioned that so I won't hammer it again. But I will say that Voldemort having a child is the least favorite part of the whole thing.

Albus and Scorpius's friendship was great, it mirrored the relationship that Harry and Ron's, in that they were both outcasts. Harry felt like he could never fill the shoes that everyone gave him, and so does Albus. I like that parallel. I like the depth that they have given Draco- he gets more of a backstory and his personality doesn't become too compromised to fit the plot. In fact, Draco's story was well done. I'm OK with the time turner story despite it's flaws... I just don't like how they butchered a lot of the integrity of the characters. Back to things I don't like again, as I've just said everything that I do like.

I'm bouncing all over the place here.. OK. I hate the fact that they never explain about the broken arm situation after the first time turner trip. I hate that they've left out so manu key characters- the surviving Weasleys, Luna, Neville, Hagrid?!! None of this is OK! What is Luna doing these days? I need to know these things.

The fight scene- if Harry was weakened by the scar and therefore was struggling against Delphi, I could see that. But no, they made a point to tell us how strong she was. Harry beat Voldemort in a duel! Harry is supposed to be really good at Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry is older now and presumably got good training from the Ministry and must have evolved. The whole spiel about how Delphi studied Harry just seems.... contrived.

Finally, Snape's character was butchered. The whole thing with Snape seemed very forced just to make the plot happened. It didn't feel like Snape at all, I don't see him saying those things about Albus/ Harry. It seemed so out of character, I was so mad because Snape is one of my favs.

If you are a Harry Potter fan, I'd still say read it. Form your own opinions because everyone took away such different experiences from their Harry Potter journeys. This is simply what I took away from this script.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

But I think those are the only reasons this book got two from me. The plot holes are one thing a HUGE thing dont get me wrong... But what really rubbed me the wrong way here was the gross diversion from the original characters' personalities. I mean you have to understand in my opinion JKR has made the most perfect characters I have ever read. They move flawlessly from books one to seven never faltering in their beliefs and standards. Not just the main three, all her characters are beautifully written. But what happened here??? Who are these people and where are the originals??? No one is what they are supposed to be. Harry is moody and mean to his SON, the orphan boy whose only relatives treated him like dirt grows up to be mean to his son???? What??? Hermoine is bossy yes but she is also a bit dull and her story here is basically about how she is supposed to be with Ron which is part of it but so much less than what she is about. Ron is running a joke shop? Why? He was never a joker I don't remember him being a big prankster.. Where is this coming from. He grew so much in seven years to be a joker in the end???? Why JKR? Why? I won't even go into all the others but put it this way... No one is the loveable character you knew in the last books. CEDRIC... That's all I can bear to write about that... I just had to put the name down but it's too painful to think about. By all means read it... You have to if only to tell yourself that we aren't all meanies that can't deal with the play format but please get it in a returnable format..

Yes, I understand that it was a play and written that way, but I was missing the magically descriptive writing style that she has that can bring you into a book and a reader can picture everything very clearly. This book had potential but unfortunately it did not live up to it. I feel as if whoever wrote this didn't stay true to the characters, I could not picture Malfoy's character saying or doing half the stuff they have him doing in this book.

Seriously from age 12-21 I couldn't get enough. I read every book over and over again on a loop. So I was hesitant to read ""the cursed child"". The problem with most sequels is that they can tarnish the original - and wouldn't that be awful. While I don't think the ""Cursed child"" ruins the original series...it does stain some of the very best parts of goblet of fire. Dead characters are brought back to life (briefly). I really wanted to like this book and did the best I could to see through the screenplay style but the plot falls short. Our favorite characters are reduced to one-dimensional versions of themselves. The only way I got through this book was the pretend it was just bad fan fiction. The one redeeming quality of the book is the ending. The whole first 90% had me shaking my head and genuinely disliking our protagonist (Albus Potter is kind of a jerk!) I easily could have done without reading the book and imagine the whole story will eventually fade in my memory while the original story will be as loved as the first time I finished the first book and every book after.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I've read them, listened to them on tape, and watched the movies - many times. Now that I've established my credentials, this is probably not worth the 20 minutes you'd spend reading it. There's no real development of the new characters or their personal interactions and dynamics. There's no real basis for the plot and most scenes are simply retreads of former Harry potter scenes.

I'm very disappointed and a little angry with Rowling for attaching her name to this, or approving it at all.

I wanted to like it...I really tried, but like many others have pointed out, this is just a hollow shell of the original series.
The characters act completely out of character, there are multiple gaping plot holes, and the writing is mediocre at best.  I am surprised anyone let this out into the world in its current state. This is not carefully crafted, witty or thoughtful. There is no real emotional depth. Everything that made 'Harry Potter' what it was in the original series is forced- poorly- into a subpar 300 page screenplay.

Spoilers ahead, so if you are planning to read, skip this; however I feel compelled to warn some of you of the ridiculous plot points:
- Apparently Voldemort had a daughter with Bellatrix Lestrange.  Not only does this not align with any of Voldemort's essential character traits, but how does this work with the timeline of the seventh novel?!
- Apparently Ron went from Auror to a drunk and head of WWW. No explanation. No mention of George. Okay. Cool.
- Rose, James, Lily, Teddy, and Hugo are pretty much completely absent.
- Apparently Harry is a heartless lifeless ministry machine who is capable of telling his son that he sometimes wishes he wasn't his father
- Speaking of Albus...don't even get me started on how poorly this character is written.
- The driving plot point is completely contrived (Albus wants to go back in time to save Cedrick, really?). And Scorpius, who is 14 or 15 and supposedly pretty smart, doesn't realize that altering the timeline will have major consequences. Okay. Awesome. Our two protagonists are complete morons.
- Apparently the whole Gang has grown up to speak in cliches. I particularly like some of Hermonione's line, ""I'm afraid you're right, old friend."" (referring to her assuring Harry that he has to be the one to transfigured into Voldemort. No joke, this is part of the plot)
- The entire concept of time travel is flawed in this book. I realize this is fantasy, but there were some pretty gaping holes. For instance, if Albus and Severus truly fixed time when they went back to fix the first task, then they wouldn't have needed to go back and fix the second task. That makes absolutely no sense.

I gave a 2 star review, because even though it is a bit of a joke, I can't help but partially enjoy something 'Harry Potter'.
There were a few touching moments and some important lessons for young readers: love and friendship. Even if these messages were conveyed much more simply in this screenplay, I still appreciate that these were the prevailing themes.
Definitely read it for yourself, but if you are a die hard fan of the original series, don't have high expectations.

***MILD SPOILERS BELOW***

While I would not compare this book to a bad fanfic, I am incredibly disappointed that JK Rowling said that this story should be considered canon. The characters are nothing like themselves in the series (Professor McGonagall is now a ditzy old lady with little regard for rules when it suits her) and they're very flat. I'm not sure how characters with SEVEN BOOKS of character development behind them could possibly be this lackluster. Parts of the story are absolutely ridiculous (the snack trolley lady is an immortal being that spends her free time making explosive pumpkin pasties and sharpening her hand-spikes? Please.)
Overall I was very disappointed by this book. The Harry Potter books were such an integral part of my childhood, and this book just felt like an awful mockery of a wonderful story and a sad attempt to milk more money out of the franchise.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I have read the whole series at least 10 times and watched all the movies countless times too. I liked the idea of writing it as a screenplay to carry the characters to the live stage instead of a new movie series, but it didn't sound like JK Rowling's voice at all and Harry wasn't Harry.

As big a Potterhead as I am, I was disappointed.

I wanted to like this play. I've loved all the Harry Potter books as a child, staying up late to go to release parties and dressing up as Harry nearly every Purim. I've won multiple large Harry Potter trivia events. My room is decorated with Hufflepuff paraphernalia. I even liked the movies, once I got over the fact that it wasn't going to be exactly like the book due to time and budget constraints and different artistic styles.
Before reading this play, I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, so I decided to be generous about it and give it some of the artistic leeway I gave the movies. Now that I'm finished, I'm angry at J.K. Rowling for putting her name on the most far-fetched idiotic fan fiction I've ever read.
I hated the cliche plot of a ""celebrity's kid upset because he's not as wonderful as parent! kid rebels! parent tries to make things better and ends up making things worse! kid gets into trouble trying to prove himself! parents saves him and they make up!""
I'm disappointed that Albus was sorted into Slytherin. Although I love his and Scorpius' friendship, it seems pretty fan fic-y to just put them both in there just cuz the 7th book ended with Harry's ""permission"" for Albus to be in Slytherin. Both Albus and Scorpius don't seem good fits for Slytherin- where's the ambition and drive that characterizes Slytherin? Both are ironically better fits for Gryffindor (although a case could be made for Scorpius in Ravenclaw).
I'm fuming about the idiotic time turner. J.K. Rowling said that she regretted ever coming up with them in the first place, which is why she destroyed all of them in book five. WHY DID THEY MAKE A COMEBACK? Also, THAT'S NOT HOW TIME TURNERS WORK! They CAN'T change the past. This was clearly explained in third book.
Voldemort had a kid??? no way. He never had sex. I can't believe this is a real thing and am now very nauseous. He's basically a snake so I'm confused.
VERY ANGRY about the character changes. Besides for the unnecessary parody of Ron just being a clown (which is dumb, but not a super unexpected caricature), other characters had their personalities completely rewritten:
-Cedric, the wonderful outgoing Hufflepuff, would become a death eater because he was- wait for it- embarrassed? I'm sorry. No. Never.
-Why did Hermione change her whole personality and become mean to Albus in that alternate dimension? ? I can imagine her being bitter towards Panjub subconsciously, but to the rest of the children? Not Hermione. Sorry. Hermione is not mean. You can change certain things about people's lives and their personalities may be different, but not their essence. Stop trying to make Hermione the new bitter Snape. She's a much stronger and generous character than that.
-Speaking about Snape, there will never be a world where he calls Hermione Hermione. Sorry. Even if they somehow became best friends he would call her Granger.
How did everyone at the end of the book see James and Lily's home? Wasn't it under a secret keeper charm? I can understand that Harry might be able to see it since technically he's inside it, which may be a loophole on the charm, but how could everyone else? Isn't this a giant plot hole?
WHY DID THE TROLLY LADY ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE CLAWS??? this is not doctor who shenanigans.
Why was Amos Diggory in a wheelchair in an old age home? Wizards live long lives. Diggory is around Arthur Weasley's age, I would guess. He's probably somewhere between 60-90 years old. That's like middle aged for wizards!
Why was Harry demoted from Head of Auror department to Head of Magical Law enforcement? Did he piss off Prime Minister Hermione? That's like being Head of FBI to become chief of police. It sounds like someone who doesn't understand Ministry of Magic hierarchy wrote this play- definitely not J.K. You would think these things would be picked up on.

I wish they treated the original books with more respect instead of going through with this garbage. I'm trying not to be angry, but it's like the people who wrote this play forgot how much an entire generation of people love Harry Potter. Besides for the fan fiction feel of the book, it's just completely littered with inconsistencies. We want to see consistency. We have theories about everything. If with the other books, people were analyzing little details and freaking out about tiny clues, why did they think we wouldn't for this one? WE HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR A NEW BOOK. Why couldn't J.K. Rowling proofread this and take out the plot holes? Couldn't she have advised the author about the characters' essence? I'm just so sad because it looks like no one bothered with making this book plausible to old readers.

Rating it more than one star because I liked Scorpius. He's the best.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I won't be basing my review off the nostalgic feeling of reading another Harry Potter book. The nostalgia was nice the five minutes it lasted; the rest of my time was spent trudging through this hastily-written squalor just to say that I did. Scorpius and Albus were fun to follow, hence the one star, and another added for the spare comedic bits that made me smile. But, if I can post a few spoilers here:
-Voldemort has a daughter, born RIGHT before the battle for Hogwarts? Yeah, that story arc is a reach, and you won't convince me otherwise.
-Don't threaten me with Voldemort, my favorite childhood antagonist, and not deliver.
-Okay, so not ONE mention of Hagrid, by far the closest thing to a father figure Harry had ever known? Is he alive, is he dead? Guess what? We'll never know!
-Albus and Scorpius are obviously gay for each other, and I dare you to tell me I'm wrong.
-You might as well have killed off Ron, as useless as he was the entire time.
-Not even just Hagrid, where's everyone else? The rest of the Weasleys, Lupin and Tonks' son, Neville, Luna? The list goes on and on. Don't call this 'The Eighth Story Nineteen Years Later' if you're not going to revive all the characters we grew to love in the first seven.
My thumbs are getting tired. Long story short, don't read this if you're expecting any sort of justice to the legacy of the first seven books. This script book is a far cry from what those books were, and my disappointment in this fact is vast.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I read every book eight times or more each book. I've watched every movie more than three times. I'm still obsessed with Harry Potter. However, this story felt nothing close to what we've been accostumed to. Every part, every plot point, felt forced, struggling with the common sense of reality. Most things happen by the hand of randomness, almost every conflict solves itself by casual chances too. I'm very pissed off Jo let something like this be published. I didn't feel her hand in here. I didn't feel most of the old characters were true to their motives and objectives. Some of them react—too—by randomness. Nevertheless, the conflict between Harry and his kid was touching and moved me. That's the only reason I don't totally hate this book. Besides, I loved the personality of Rose and I totally loved Scorpius. Albus was good too. About the old ones, I couldn't help but totally emphitise with Harry, Draco, Ginny and Hermione—although the last one had thoughts and actions way dumber than young clever Hermione. Ron was so stupid... And Minerva McGonagall, oh my God, they totally destroyed the character and made her very soft.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If all the names and words indicating that this book is a Harry Potter book were swapped with unfamiliar ones, you would not be reminded of Harry at all..so to speak..i feel like this book had its soul sucked out by dementors. Its an empty shell.
The cursed child is advertised as being about friendship and staying true to the core of the other books in the series..but it is not. It's more about attachment.. and selfishness.. and fear.. than love and friendship. Scorpious is a good character, Ill give them that.. But he's new. Sometimes people attach themselves to an image.. a face.. and think that if they mimic that face..or that emotion.. that it will be enough..that it expresses the same thing.. well, it does not.. and most fans, who grew up with Harry.. can tell that this is not the same thing as Harry Potter.

At points it could work as an extension of the series, at others it reads like fan fiction.

The marketing of this book as another harry potter work when it's the script for a play that is only supervised by JK Rowling is disingenuous. It crumbles under the limitation of a short play, the long span of time in the books, with the characters and plot developments and tangents is missing. The plot that is available is as if someone wanted to push a storyline that was separate from Harry Potter in Harry Potter, using a time travel concept that forces the story to work on past events instead of creating anything new.

I understand it's JK ROWLING's right to do anything she wants with the series, but between this and making pronouncements on twitter undermining her work and retconning it, I am kind of glad she won't be making a full sequel to this series again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Who actually wrote this book? So many of the characters are not true to themselves.

And how old is 'Delphi in this book,  22 some years after Beatrix' death? Cedric becoming a death eater owing to being a sore loser? Wow. Scorpius getting quickly sorted in Slytherin and showing all through the book how much more of a Griffindor (or Ravenclaw) he truly is. (maybe the sorting hat was prejudiced...) If you are an informed Harry Potter fan, read that book (borrow it) for the fun of being shocked at how lame it is. But the price tag is a little high for that.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

A disappointment.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2016","I wanted to love this. I've been eagerly anticipating it since it was announced. And I tried to talk myself into liking it the entire time I read it. But there are just too many problems.

First, I realize this is a play—just stage directions and scene notes and dialogue. So right off you're not going to get the beautiful, rich prose of J. K. Rowling. And it will be clipped—there isn't time in a play (even a 5 hour, two-part play) for all of the little details that Rowling is able to weave together in her novels. But this felt like bad fan-fiction. Most scenes were 1 1/2 to 3 pages long. Things jumped all over the place and felt disjointed. A play was definitely not the right forum for this story.

Second, characters did and said things that are inconsistent with the characters Rowling gave us in her seven books. I did not believe most of the characters.

Third, the plot kept getting more twisted and convoluted and soap opera-y. The structure, symbolism, and relatability of the seven books were thrown out the window.

On a positive note, there were some redeemable themes that we come to expect and love from J. K. Rowling. Themes of love, trust, acceptance, and redemption are touched upon. I loved the fact of the central, unexpected friendship. I didn't love the journey they took, but the fact of the friendship was beautiful to me. And there was more understanding and acceptance at the end.

Overall I'm glad I read it. But I probably won't need to read it again. And I definitely don't count this work as Harry Potter canon. I'll stick with the original, amazing seven books.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

K. Rowling is actually a script for theatre. This is the story of an adult Harry Potter and primarily his son, Albus and his best friend, Scorpius (Draco's son). It deals with parenting, expectations and time travel. In my mind, this one was nowhere near as good as any of the others in the Harry Potter series.  It was mostly nostalgic in that it revisits the Triwizard Tournament from Goblet of Fire and some old characters make an appearance.

I did not like:

  The plot with Delphi was completely out of the blue and really didn't seem possible, so the book seemed corny.

  I really missed J. K. Rowling's writing!

  The grown versions of Harry, Hermione and Ron were dull and seemed like totally different people. (Harry ordering Prof. McGonagall around seemed very out of character and that's just one example of many.)

  Harry had three children, but James and Lily are barely even mentioned.  Same with Ron and Hermione's son, barely mentioned.

  It lacks the humor the other Harry Potter books had and just didn’t make enough sense to be good.  (This one only had a couple funny parts--Hermione's daughter Rose was a bright spot and Ron was still kind of funny but it seemed forced.)

I liked:

  Draco and his son, Scorpius.

  That it is a quick read and wasn't bored with it or felt I was plowing through.

  Harry and his son Albus coming to understand each other--heartwarming.

  Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose, because she takes after Hermione.

If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be blah. I would not recommend buying this book and wish I had used the money I spent on it for something else.  Get it from the library and save your money.  If you read it not expecting it to be good like the others, then you probably will enjoy it, somewhat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Another problem is that the writer wreaks havoc on beloved Harry Potter characters.  Harry, having lost his horcrux, is now a mediocre wizard and not much of a Dad.  We learn that a few bad breaks can turn Hermione into a mean spirited and sad woman.  Ron is nothing more than a jokester and Ginny still doesn't have character.

As a huge HP fan I was willing to give this book a chance, even knowing that it was not written by JK Rowling. I think it was very deceitful how it was promoted (in Argentina people were talking about the 8th Harry Potter book!), but I was willing to overlook this for the love of Potter.
I had very low expectations...but the script doesn't even live up to them.  The characters have lost their essence, the dialogues are very choppy, the situations are unbelievable and the plot is full of holes.
*SPOLIERS*
What I didn’t like:
1. I do not believe that Voldemort would have a child. He is not a sexual being, he is driven by power. Also, maybe this is different in wizard world, but Bellatrix should be too old to be able to carry a baby.
2. If they had had a baby in Malfoy manor, Draco would know about this. They were living in the same house! How come this never comes up? He never tells anyone?
3. I understand that Draco kind of redeems himself at the end of Deathly Hallows, but he is still a Death Eater...how come he raises the best kid in the whole story? Albus is a whiny self-centered drama queen and Rose is a selfish snob. In the epilogue of the books they show that they are not really aware of their parents’ fame, so why would Rose show this entitlement about having to choose carefully their friends because everyone would want to be their friend? I cannot believe that a child raised by Hermione and Ron would be this cold and stuck up!!!
4. Leave Dumbledore alone. He does not deserve to appear in such a stupid, blubbering manner.
5. My biggest problem: the PLOT. If we are supposed to believe that this was all Delphi's plan, how come Albus thinks about it? Did she incept this idea in his mind? if so, this should have been made more clear. In order to ""surprise"" us with the fact that she is the villain they left a huge plot hole, because Albus decides by himself (after overhearing a conversation) that he is going to help Mr. Diggory, he escapes the Hogwarts express with much difficulty, finds the retirement home (how?), informs them of his plan, finds pollyjuice potion (how?), has parts of Ron, Harry and Hermione to change into and decides to steal the timeturner and go back to save Cedric. How did Delphini plan this? It is really very improbable.
6. In the alternate reality where Ron and Hermione never marry we are presented with a bitter, unfulfilled, cold Hermione...yeah...right. Because she cannot find professional and personal success without a husband and kids by her side. This is so sexist and un-Rowling like that it made me sick.
7. Harry forbids Albus from being friends with Scorpius. This is stupid, out of character and annoying. AND he is nasty to Prof. MacGonagall (who must be really old by now!)
8. I will not believe that Cedric could EVER become a Death Eater. This is stupid. We are presented with a character who is good, and noble. No amount of humiliation would have turned him into a DE
9. So, Hermione is the Minister of Magic but she doesn’t increase or improve the security. To the point that the kids infiltrate it the same way that she already did! She knows that this is a flaw in security! And, as someone else stated in their review, how come the Ministry does nothing to dispel the rumor that Scorpius is Voldy’s son???? Hermione cannot be such a bad Minister! She is supposed to be the cleverest witch of her time!
10. The people who wrote this script are not really familiar with how magic works in this Universe. They forgot how to make pollyjuice potion (Albus thinks that it would be a good plan and they discard this idea because they do not have a part of Voldemort, nobody points out that they need at least a month to brew it!!! And it is not possible to transfigure a person into someone else! This was never presented during the 7 books! It is unacceptable that it is possible now. What about the FIDELIUS CHARM?????? How can they all see Harry’s parents, find his house??????????? They were in hiding!!!!!! This is just sloppy! Or maybe there is an explanation and I can’t find it.
11. I won’t get into the whole time travel plot hole, but it is lazy and stupid. I would have preferred a new story and adventure and leave the past in the past.
What I liked:
1. Taking a glimpse at my beloved characters  again(although they are not themselves)
2. Scorpius. He is by far the best character in the story.
3. Going back to Godric’s Hollow.
4. Finding out that Harry has some contact with Duddley.
5. Scorpius and Albus friendship…maybe even more? I loved them together.
I really hope that the stage version is better: probably with good acting and special effects this could be entertaining. I insist on telling all my friends that this is NOT the 8th Harry Potter book! It is not. I hope that JK Rowling writed something more about this story in Pottermore to clarify this errors and make me love the future Harry Ron and Hermione as much as their book versions!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Do NOT read this book!  It is as bad as, and indeed worse than some, fan fics I have read of Harry Potter over the years.  Not only does it play fast and loose with the characters' traits (Harry is a jerk/Hermione the Minister of Magic???/Ron runs Fred and George's joke shop?!), but it plays loose with established rules of magic in the Harry Potter universe.  Towards the end, one character mentions the possibility of brewing a Polyjuice Potion in under a day.  Anyone who knows the books well knows that it takes a MONTH to brew Polyjuice Potion.  Am I being a little too demanding?  Perhaps.  But J.K. Rowling wrote the original seven books, she did NOT write this.  Please note:  J.K. Rowling did NOT write this!  She and two others came up with the story, and then one of them wrote the actual play.  That's another point:  This is not a book.  Don't expect Rowling's descriptions and turn of phrase---all of it is mostly dialogue as it is in play format.  This will make a lot of people unhappy.  It does not gel well with the other books.  It also, quite literally, re-writes Potter history.  Plus, the dialogue is cringe-worthy:  ""Draco:  Hermione Granger, I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger.  And I'm mildly enjoying it.""  Ack!!!  Is this supposed to be flirting?  Or what?  It is so awkward and cringe inducing that it makes the plot almost secondary.  Almost.  The plot does what the third book only dreamed of:  rewrite history, again, and again, and yet again.  It was enough that, even though I loved Rowling's 600+ page books, this mere 300 page book had me looking for the end.  In short, don't waste your time!  You'll regret it, because it will color your experience with the Harry Potter universe overall.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_72?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=72&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

As of writing this review, I am roughly 3/4 of the way through the screenplay. I will edit my review if the ending somehow changes my mind about the work as a whole, but I highly doubt that will be the case.

First of all, if you do not already know, this is not a book so much as it is a screenplay. It's written like a play, and it reads as such. There's notes here and there to indicate what the characters are doing, but everything else is strictly dialogue. I also think that some of the character traits have been over-exaggerated in a way that is necessary to make a stage performance entertaining. Ron's character (which is mostly comic relief here) is a good example of that.

I admittedly was not expecting much from this story. And I honestly found it to be in sort of poor taste. Albus and Harry have a difficult time connecting as son and father, and Albus' first 3 years at Hogwarts are fairly miserable (They are also covered very quickly. We're on Year 4 by page 38). He's sorted into Sytherin, and the only friend he has is Draco Malfoy's son Scorpius. (Even Hermione and Ron's daughter of the same age, Rose, doesn't want to hang out with Albus.) Scorpius has his own troubles too - there's a rumor that he's really Voldemort's son. (Somehow? There isn't a very good explanation as to why anyone thinks this.) Meanwhile, Harry and Hermione, who both work at the Ministry of Magic, have discovered a Death Eater who was in possession of a Time Turner that can go years back in time. Amos Diggory hears this rumor, and begs Harry to use the device to go back in time and prevent the death of his son, Cedric. (Who died in the 4th Harry Potter book, ""The Goblet of Fire."") Harry denies its existance, knowing that altering the past is not something to be trifled with.

Albus, however, overhears all of this and decides that he wants to right a mistake his father made in the past. He teams up with Cedric's cousin Delphi, and Scorpius, and devises a plan to steal the Time Turner, go back in time to 1994, and interfere with the Triwizard Tournament in an attempt to get Cedric to drop out, and thus save his life. Scorpius and Albus continue to meddle with the timeline, resulting in drastic changes to the present.

This time traveling plot is not at all well-thought-out, like the one in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban."" Instead we have the two boys meddling with the past in 5 minute increments (all the Time Turner will allow) and causing disasterous results in the present ala ""The Butterfly Effect"" . It also results in there being very little real story in the present. The screenplay spends too much time mulling over the past and giving known characters from the books cameos, and not enough time developing its characters in the present. (The other two Potter children are barely in the story, and Ron and Hermione's son is only mentioned in passing. I literally forgot they had another child since he isn't around or mentioned in the Howarts express scene. And several supporting characters from the original series are only mentioned, if even. I haven't seen Luna's name once.)

We're also completely disconnected from Harry, who acts as badly and irrationally as the teachers and adults who drove us batty back in the original series. He duels with Malfoy in the kitchen, forbids his son to see Scorpius based on something a centuar told him, and goes so far as to instruct Professor McGonagall, now the headmaster of the school, to watch them via the Marauder's Map and separate them anytime they are together. We are not privvy to why he does any of this, and it honestly seems very out-of-character.

Certain cameos are interesting, especially ones with characters that died in the original series and are still alive in the altered present, but the whole story is unconvincing and does not capture the characters in any way that stays true to their natures from the original books. This does not feel like a continuation, but rather a fictional work based off of the series. A Fanfic.

As others have said, worth a read to decide for yourself. But keep expectations very low.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Ok, let's start with what I liked. I liked another Harry Potter story. Period. It was a joy to read because, well, it's Harry Potter. I'd swim the Copacabana beaches to get a HP story (my dig at Rio...).

 Second, I am a huge sucker for Butterfly Effect storylines. They intrigue me (one of the reasons I like the Star Trek Kelvin Timeline so much). It is interesting to see what a fixed point in time is like in the Harry Potter world. Cedric must die. Cedric’s death rocked me. It was so quick and so final. There was no pleading or begging. There was no reason other than he wasn’t supposed to be there. Kill the spare. Avada Kedava. Dead. Cedric was an innocent in the whole bloody mess and his death, no matter how tragic, had to happen. And that’s the true tragedy. The lesson is sometimes the dead need to stay dead. In a way, his death was one of the reasons the Riddle was defeated. The script is clear on that, but I have reservations about how it came about (more below). Still, it brings about a painful moment in Harry's life. The reason he can see the Thestrals.

I liked Harry witnessing the death of his parents and doing nothing about it. He understands. I think he always did and messing with a timeline doesn't change that. It wasn't something he didn't already know. He didn't have an ""aha!"" moment in this story. The scene itself was a very touching and a heartbreaking moment in Harry's life. And he was able to share it with Albus. Too bad he doesn't see Snape sneak in. That would have made me cry. Him too I suspect.

But I'm afraid I have far too many negatives.

First, it lacked depth. I know this is a play and you need to see the actors. I'm sure the scripts from the movies looked hollow as well. But this was, well, totally hollow. There was very little character development of the three new characters and what development there was was squeezed from really a common cliched plot: parent and child don't understand each other, child does something stupid, parents still loves child, parent and child reunite to fix the stupid, parent and child love each other. Yawn.

I could tell it was written by someone else. It lacked all of Rowling’s elegance. Because it is a script does not matter at all. Rowling writes incredible dialogue which in many cases was transferred directly to the movie. When the characters speak to one another it felt chucky and forced. The scene in which Albus (as Ron with the polyjuice potion) tells his aunt he wants to have more babies and kisses her was pretty terrible. The dialogue was horrible and, well, ew.

The established characters were flat and did not act as themselves in any of their incarnations. (Harry, Hermione, and Ron specifically). I didn't expect much growth from our heroes because, well, they're adults and, sorry to say, once adults get into a rut they tend to stay there. That doesn't mean they can't break free with magnificent results, but, well, most of the time they don't. Ron was nothing more than comic relief. While he added the comic relief several times during the HP books and movies (""Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?""), Ron's character served MANY important purposes as, and this is not an exhausted list, a link to a new family for Harry, being his foil in many ways, and showing the darker side of friendship (jealousy specifically). Hermione was simply not a clever girl. Really, Minister? An illegal time-turner hidden in a place even our bumbling heroes could find it? Harry was also a problem. He was not Harry. He had none of his gentle compassion and understanding. I know, I know, he’s a bored Ministry worker. I know, I know, he was traumatized from Riddle. But not really if you take into account the final scene in the movie and the book. Harry was beautiful with Albus. Albus was unsure and Harry was kind, compassionate, and loving. There was no hint that there was any strife between them. At all. And the movie establishes a very happy Albus getting on that train. While movie and book are different, Rowling has always supported the films as her visions and never, so far as I know, disagreed with how her characters and the action is interpreted. And I don’t think it’s a matter of not wanting to tank her own movies. I think she really does support everything. So…an unhappy Albus doesn’t make much sense. It’s simply a plot device used to create a weak plot.

To that end there are several plot points that just don’t jive. I have no doubt Riddle could have, and possibly did, father a child. I have no doubt he and Bella got it on. But come on, people. Bella pregnant? No. If he was to have a child it should have been an unknown. A rape would have even been better and more consistent with Riddle's personality. An angry, violated mother that was capable to turning out a child just like Riddle himself through years of being hated for being alive, the cycle of abuse well established for a third round. Also any child of Tom and Bella would have been much, MUCH older than Scorpius and Albus, not what appears to simply be an older girl. She'd be older than Harry. We never see Bella pregnant since she got out of Azkaban with Tom's return meaning any child had to happen over about 15 years before Order of the Phoenix.

Now, as much as I like Cedric as a fixed point in time, I don’t think being humiliated at the Tri-wizard Tournament was enough to make anyone become a Death Eater. It was one time. What about consistent humiliation over a period of years? Not even then. Look at Neville. My god, Harry for the first 11 years of his life! The whole point of Harry Potter is that it is what that is inside that determines who you are, not what is done to you. I consider Cedric to be a literary ideal character, like Samwise or Faramir. Cedric as a Death Eater is about as consistent as Samwise stabbing Frodo to get the Ring. Nuh uh.Nope.

Finally, the number of old characters seems forced. One of my only gripes with X-Men movies is when they try to force too many mutants into a movie. The result is the inability to develop new mutants or continue to develop old mutants. It becomes a distraction. While I was thrilled to see Snape again, I don’t think he was used well or efficiently. It was one of the better “cameos” but given the attempted to focus the story on the boys, it was hollow as well. Yes. He still loved Lily. Yes he’s still loyal to the Order. Yes, he dies. Again. But his death is almost a shadow of what it was in the proper timeline. Dementor’s Kiss is bad, but being killed by Riddle knowing what we now know is heroic and the only way Snape should die. I think his Cursed Child death almost diminishes him in the alternate timeline. I also take issue with Dumbledore crying his eyes out. No. Just no. That is not who Dumbledore is and that is not how I want Dumbledore presented. It’s just wrong.

So there you have it. No real need to argue any points with me. I enjoyed it for what it was, but called it out for what it wasn’t. I have high hopes for Fantastic Beasts because I believe this will take us back to the proper presentation of Rowling’s world (since she wrote it). This seemed a lazy effort in a world so complex and interwoven world wherein zero plot holes have ever existed. Until now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_97?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=97&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I understood that this was a script, and I realized that it was not written by JK Rowling herself, but rather as a collaborative work That being said, without seeing this play performed, it feels like absolute rubbish. It's possible that the story just doesn't translate well on page, but I doubt it. The flow is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious— which is really awful considering it's a script and therefore is nearly entirely dialogue. The characters are horrid; I can't believe a word of what they're saying. The tone and dialects are completely different from the novels. The original novels had a richness to them, in part due to the wonderful scenery described by Rowling. I can only hope that when performed, the play gains back some of that vivid imagery that made the books so immersive. Overall this read like a poorly executed bit of fan fiction, but I'll hold off on my final judgement until I've seen it performed on stage.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If you're a big HP fan like I am, you'll likely be disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Despite being the perfect age when the Harry Potter novels came out, I largely ignored them as a child and into my early adult years, thinking they were childish - despite the fact that nearly all my adult relatives had rabidly consumed the novels and stood in lines eagerly at midnight with their children for each book released. I am not sure why, but with the pending birth of my daughter a couple years ago, I decided to read up on the series, I guess thinking it would be a fun series of books to expose her to at some point. Needless to say, I was hooked and promptly mowed through the original seven novels in about a month. I was completely blown away by what a mature story Rowling had to tell. It all made sense: the fandom, the mania and the desire for more stories about the boy who lived.

The reason I painted the image above is because I really wanted to stress the impact the novels had on an adult male. I honestly do not think I could imagine the sort of impact the original stories would have had on children and young adults growing up with the novels and how it would have had such a lasting impact on them into their adult years and further on with children of their own. Those are the people I thought of when I finished this script: the die-hard fans that eat up every morsel of information they can from Miss Rowling. This must have been a painful experience for each and every one of them, as it was a painful experience for me.

I honestly do not believe I could even expound upon the flaws any more than what has been stated in previous reviews. The plot is muddling, the characters we know and love are one dimensional cardboard cutouts - truly caricatures of their younger selves. Honestly, I could go on and on, but instead I will just point to the one moment this story completely lost me without spoiling it for those that haven't read it: Very early in the script, Harry Potter says something to his son, something that I cannot fathom the character ever saying, especially considering his childhood and life experiences. It is so out of character. Truthfully, there is no conceivable plot device that could convince me he would utter those words.

I will say, however, all of us need to be aware this is a rehearsal script, for a play only partially penned by JK Rowling (if at all). Perhaps if there was not such emphasis on this being a definitive eighth chapter, there would be more acceptance for the product which was released here. I imagine the play looks fantastic on stage, especially with an impressive lineup of actors, but as a simple script that pulls from such a rich history of novels, this falls very flat and is nearly unrecognizable as a Harry Potter story.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I've relished the books and re-watched the films again and again. Since this is a review for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and not JK Rowling's incredible books one through seven, I'll be brief. The plot of HP and the Cursed Child is terrible. Worst of all, the characters aren't themselves. It's almost like someone read a summary of her books and then tried to write a story. There are flashbacks to parts in her books that make it bearable, but overall this book is such an unfortunate disappointment. It's missing emotion. It's missing color. Most significantly, it's missing authenticity. I hate rating it low, but aside from the aforementioned, it was a tough read for even a loyal HP fan.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

If you are not yet aware, it is important that you should know, IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY J.K. ROWLING! So if you are a die-hard Harry Potter fan, looking for your next fix- this is not whereypu would get it. I don't know why J.K. put her stamp of approval on it. There are too many flaws.
Firstly, all of the characters are badly portrayed:
Ron is just a joke. He is funny in a way that is very un-Ron. He isn't put together (worse than the books). He has corny Dad jokes. And that is it. That is all he adds to the book. You don't see his personality from the HP series. You don't see him support Harry the way he did in the books. You don't even see their deep friendship. He is just there.
Then there is Hermione. In The Cursed Child, she has chosen work over family and became Minister FOR Magic. (They didn't even get the title right! Jeez!) You don't see much of her caring side. She is mostly there to nag.
And then there is Harry. *deep,dejected sigh* I can't begin to express how the writers got Harry wrong. Just. Wow. I can't even go there because I may never finish writing. Let's just say it is pretty bad.
These are just the threesome. You can imagine how the minor characters must have been butchered.
Plot: Harry's son is going through needless angst. CLearly nobody communicates in this version of the wizarding world, and while I understand his problems and they are interesting, they don't sit well with you because you feel that the way his problems were presented, Actual Harry would have resolved them.
Oh! And Dumbledore makes an appearance! He comes in for a scene or two to be the token mentor figure and say a few wise words that sound cheesy. And stupid. Only the pen of J.K. Rowling can create the true Albus Dumbledore.
The only good thing about this play is Scorpius. Scorpius is adorable. The reason I even gave this play two stars is because Scorpius deserves a star all on his own. He is sweet, funny and relatable. He can be endearingly awkward, and you have to admire his optimism no matter how many times Rose rejects him!
After giving this book some thought, I wondered if it would be enjoyable if it stood on its own- if it wasn't meant to be compared to the Harry Potter series. If Harry Potter books 1-7 had never existed. I quickly came to the conclusion that The Cursed Child would still be a waste of time and most certainly would never have become a widespread phenomenon.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I didn't realize when I got this book, that it wasn't in fact written by J.K. Rowling.
I would describe it as a mediocre fan fiction. I've only gotten part of the way through it, and the characters lack any depth, emotions are very flat, and I just can't get attached to the characters like I did with the Harry Potter series. I doubt I'd be invested in this book emotionally enough to cry like I cried for Sirius or  Dobby.
They also don't seem to be themselves. Hermoine isn't clever, she's very flat. Harry loses that deep value of friendship that made his character so special. I was so excited for this book and I really tried to like it. But, it isn't worth the money to buy physically (like I did.) If you want to read it for yourself Id suggest just buying the ebook.

Second, as stated on the cover ""based on an original new story by J.K Rowling,""  the play is actually by Jack Thorne, and you can tell, **especially** after Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them came out. The magic in her work is just not there in ""The Cursed Child."" When reading this, I really got a taste of fan service; dynamics... characters... scenes... so much of the story felt just so hackneyed. On the other hand, other scenes and major characters seemed to behave in non-canonical ways, which is just disappointing.

I will say, this probably was still cute on stage. Cheesy, but probably far more entertaining than reading. So, perhaps I'm judging too harshly on reading a text that was meant to be performed and not read.

If you're debating on whether or not you should buy this book, I'll pose the question to you that I did to my mother when she asked if she ought to read it: Do you want this book for this collection, to further prove you are a Harry Potter nerd, like myself? Will you feel the story isn't complete unless you pick it up? If yes, you probably have it already, or will buy it regardless of what reviews say.
  On the other hand, if quality is a standard of yours, and you don't want your final impression of the Harry Potter saga to be on a sour, or at the very least flat, note. You might want to pass.  Best of luck! ~Mischief Managed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

The book consisted of only works being spoken between two or three characters so it was difficult to fully understand.  It was obviously not written by J.K. Rowling and a very disappointing read.  If she plans on releasing anything else about Harry Potter in the future, I certainly hope she delivers what the fans expect from such an exciting story teller.

The characters didn't feel like those I grew so fond of.

***Spoiler Alert!****
Things that really bothered me:
- Draco seems to have all of a sudden turned into some nice guy who likes working with Harry and Hermione to make sure Voldemort doesn't get back in power.
- How many times do Scorpius and Albus need to hug? At first, I thought it was a build up to them falling in love, but it wasn't. . . they both conveniently have crushes on different girls.
- The dialogue for Ron Weasley was downright annoying. It's like he regressed into being a preadolescent boy rather than maturing into an adult.
- Could Scorpius be any nicer? There was no complexity to his character at all.

It would have been nice to have seen Professor Lupin's son in the play. I did enjoy getting to see Snape again, but it seemed contrived that characters from the past got to tell what they were feeling to the present day characters.

I wish I never read this.

I thrive on a story having description, something that pulls me into the story makes me long to read more and this didn't do it beyond wanting to know where the authors were taking this story...morbid curiosity?

There were moments that made me smile and appreciate a little humor, but there was nothing that hit me in the feels or made me gasp and HAVE to turn the page. I wanted something more compelling and a little less predictable. It was almost too easy to predict what was going to happen and how. I disliked how the characters were portrayed, Harry was a total douche-bag to Albus and even Ginny at times. Ron was an imbecile, and oblivious to everything around him, and Draco I don't even know who the Draco was in this book.

I expected something similar to the originals, kids in class experiencing what it means to be a wizard, sure Albus dealing with living in the shadow of his father same with Scorpius along with the other stuff that happened, but that is not what we get. We aren't even in Hogwarts...at all. It's immediately thrown into the story of polyjuice potion (of course), stealing, time turners, flashbacks, and of course Voldemort. By the third or fourth act Albus is already a fourth year, so we get NOTHING of his struggles at Hogwarts other than him saying it's horrible. BUT WHY? I would have liked a new villain, one that had no association with Voldemort. It felt like this was an opportunity to create something new out of the Harry Potter universe, but it relies too heavily on reliving the past or rather trying to change it.

There was a few things that I didn't like at all one of which a comment Harry makes about not having a father figure and not knowing how to be one......SAY WHAT??? Do we need to rehash almost every man in Harry's life? I was not happy with this book and it makes me sad.

First of all- time travel is SUCH a cop out in sequels. So confusing. It is used as a crutch when the author can not develop well thought out characters themselves, they rely on the nostalgia of existing or beloved characters that readers already have deep feelings for, which coincidentally are the ONLY parts of this book I enjoyed (Cedric, Snape, etc)
Second of all- It is written AS A PLAY, which I get, doesn't make it any easier to read or enjoy. Breaking that 3rd wall between the audience and characters takes a lot of the magic out of it (pun intended). I don't even know HOW one could make this into a play (how do you do magic/shape shifting/time changing on stage?!?!)

Not recommended","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2016","Nineteen years after the end of the book series, Harry and Draco's sons set off to Hogwarts, to become best friends and get in all sorts of trouble. The Cursed Child suffers a bad case of sequelitis, borrowing fanfiction tropes and characterization, and relying on the emotional appeal of numerous cameo appearances. The plot's a mess of predictable tropes, and the emotional messages--especially revolving around cameo characters--grow trite. But seeing familiar characters and Slytherin house in a new light provides interesting insight, and Scorpius and Albus are the play's saving grace: they're well-characterized and engaging, and their relationship is fantastic--despite the compulsory heterosexuality that looms over what's obviously a romance. Come to this for the characters, not the plot, and lower your expectations to allow for reiteration and artless indulgence, and it's not awful. But--like the questionable content of the Pottermore extended universe--it's not a must-read, even for fans.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I know it said screen play but I thought it was an actual book and contained a screen play as an added bonus. If I'm going to read a screen play I want to be an active participant in a play! As much as I loved HP this was a huge disappointment for me. The characters weren't developed enough and there wasn't enough background knowledge to know who the characters were. This book had so much hype behind it and it was really all for nothing. A series from my childhood is now complete and it was an absolute waste of my time.

I loved these books when I was younger, and wanted nothing more than for this to measure up. Sadly, this was not meant to be.

The Cursed Child follows Albus Potter and his friend, Scorpius Malfoy. Yes, you read that right, and it's actually one of the good things about this book. Together, these two friends confront some ghosts of Harry's past.

The main reason to hate this book? So, so much wasted potential. Most of the other new characters do absolutely nothing, and dozens of still living, beloved characters from the originals are conspiciously absent. But other than that, the plot is also pretty bad. There is a fairly long time skip towards the beginning,and in order for this plot to work, many characters have to fail at basic common sense. Just don't waste your money on this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Jack Thorne hasn't read the novels and only sat through the movies. Can't even play by its own rules much less the ones set up in the books.
  Fair warning I'm going to spoil everything. So they're using a knockoff time turner that can send you back but only for five minutes. Fair enough but then they get sent to Godric's hollow 1981 and suddenly they're stuck there. What happened to the time limit? Everyone seriously just forgets about it. So whatever through the power of pulling things out of the authors bum they send a message to the present. Conveniently it works and Malfoy conveniently has another time turner to save them. But Albus and Scorpius don't even know Malfoy has it. They're acting on information they don't have. They have no plan for what to do after contacting the present and it works out anyway.
  But whatever harry and crew arrive and decide to disguise one of themselves as Voldemort in order to capture his daughter. (99)  I seriously rolled my eyes when Voldemort has a daughter was revealed it's the dumbest, most hackneyed obvious thing to do for  a villain so of course they did that. Anyway they polyjuice potion them some Voldemort. Point A polyiuice takes about a month to make This isn't isn't some little point only a diehard fan would know, but a fairly significant part of chamber of secrets.

I started reading the original series before it was popular in the US (my sister had brought me a copy of the first book after a trip to England).  After that first book, I was hooked.  So after all this time, we were told ANOTHER new book was coming out: my daughter and I were at the bookstore to get it at the release party at midnight.  There was no way I'd miss a new HP story!  But please be aware before you read this book: if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will be disappointed!  Very disappointed.  It's just not the same.  Also, this is a script, which some people may find a little hard to navigate, although I had no trouble with it.

This book, said to be the final Harry Potter story, focuses on Harry and Ginny's son, Albus.  It begins around the time Albus enters his first year at Hogwarts and ends with him ready to begin year five.  Albus doesn't seem to have many friends and has trouble fitting in, unlike his very popular father.  Personally, I thought Albus was a turd.  He didn't seem to have a personality and was an arse to everyone.  It's no wonder he didn't have any friends, except Draco Malfoy's son, Scorpius (who actually was a much better character than Albus).  Being young, dumb boys, Albus and Scorpius get into a bit of trouble, which Harry and others need to get them out of.  That's the whole story....and then it ends abruptly.

The only good part of this book included a return of a few characters I've missed in my life for a while now, since the end of the series.  I've missed Snape.  And he made an appearance, although short, in this book.  Same with Dumbledore.  It was good to see them again.

Really, this book wasn't worth the time I invested to read it.  The only reason I am leaving 2 stars instead of 1 is because Snape appeared and that made me happy for maybe 5 pages.  The rest of the book (especially the ending) wasn't worth my time.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_100?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=100&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Unfortunately, this felt like I was revisiting a badly written version of earlier books. I was expecting a play that gave me more of an insight on Harry's life, his work at the Ministry, his new role as a husband and father, other magical worlds, etc. The first thing that annoyed me in the scene descriptions was the phrase ""this is magic. this is chaos"", which seemed like a condescending gesture toward the reader and which in hindsight actually seem to excuse the unimaginative plot.The time-turner is grossly overused and seems like a cheap plot device. I might have as well watched Back to the Future again . The simultaneous use of two time-turners was even more ludicrous. (So on one time turner they had only 5 minutes to change the past and on another they had more minutes--wouldn't this have had some kind of effect?---otherwise why point out the difference between time-turners... It really seemed like the characters spent hours awkwardly waiting for Voldemort at Godrick's Hollow) The story lacked verisimilitude. Many characters (Rose, Delphi, Ron, Hermione), were left undeveloped. Delphi's intervention at the end seemed forced. She did not play that much of a leading role at the beginning when they were trying to bring Cedric back then she suddenly appears at the end, only after receiving an Owl from Albus. If she really was planning to bring back Voldemort she would have intervened earlier. Finally, the idea that Voldemort and Bella had sex in some room of Malfoy's Manor was laughable and implausible, given Rowling's characterization of Voldemort.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_101?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=101&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Caution: spoilers below...

Poor Cedric Diggory, what have they done to you? Ruined you, basically. And despite decent writing (and a stupid, but entertaining enough plot) let you down along with all of us muggles.

Pros: Scorpius is a cutie, one who deserves better friends. And his friendship with Albus could be really sweet when Albus could tone down his attitude.

Cons: Where to start...

Sweet Cedric. I'm sorry that the authors felt the need to spit on your grave and then have Harry Potter use you as tool to bond with his son. As a Hufflepuff I'm super offended by the treatment of Cedric. We have three major characters, and they just decided to take our young pure-hearted martyred hero and just turn him into a murderous psycho because he got embarrassed at a school competition? And not only that, they had him kill Neville. Plus basically usher in a new dark age. I had to put down the book for like a full hour. How effing dare they.

The dialog. It could be just fine, but then occasionally things got weird. One 12 year old calling another an irrelevance? Cedric talking like a stilted old fogey ""then I shall""? Albus calling his bf's dad by his first name? Not to mention the bizarre statements some of them make. (I'm looking at you father of the year.)

I also knew something was up with Delphi from the start. What ""twenty-something"" tells a little boy to come hang out with them at their elderly uncle's retirement home? But I had no idea she would be something as ridiculous as she was...

The side characters. Why were they all either flat or horrible? Rose is awful: you can do better Scorpius! Let that other nice girl love you. Or wrangle Albus into shape, because he's at least nice to you (usually).

On a more amusing note; Ron must be a terrible kisser because Hermione didn't realize she was kissing an inexperienced teenager. Who was also her nephew.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it, you want to sell it.

Let's be clear...this was not written by JK...this is based on her series. And that becomes terribly clear very early on. Additionally, the number of names that are dropped is astronomical! Anyone worth knowing in the Potterverse is up front and counted. As in main character. The story, the plotline...it meanders all over the place that the reader wonders if the writers had a clue to start with or if it was just to ""stand on the shoulders of geniuses."" There was no way this was going to fail...none. The generation that grew up reading Harry's stories are now buying their own books and financing their own plays. Their imagination was set free with JK's works and personally I think that was one of her greatest gifts...engaging our imagination. This reads like fan fiction, poorly written fan fiction and not even with any good ships!

That is what this is. It's a bit harsh, but I honestly couldn't help thinking this while reading, without ever having seen another review.
The plot revolves around Harry Potter's son, Albus, dealing with the insecurities and ""consequences"" of being the hero of the wizarding world's son. A rift is sown between father and son that continues to grow, despite Harry's best intentions, leading to a series of unfortunate events, beginning with Albus using a time-turner to go back in time to attempt to change the past along with his best friend Scorpius, and the mysterious newcomer, Delphi Diggory. Albus gets more than he bargained for when his meddling sets off a butterfly effect of negative changes to the future. Now he has to try to correct his mistake and save the future, while unaware of the dangers around him.... It sounds interesting enough, but it somehow falls short. The characters are 2 dimensional and out of character. The dialogue and plot are watered down and unrealistic/unbelievable. And great Scott, there are SO many plot holes. I guess I just expected something different. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts and watch Albus grow from there. I wasn't completely against them revisiting scenes from the previous books, because I was curious to see them (briefly) played out in a different way, or as a means to show Albus glimpses of his father's life to give him a different perspective about him. However, I would have much preferred a look into Albus' life at Hogwarts, along with Scorpius, to really understand him and his issues, not a fast-forward synopsis of his life and first 4 years in Hogwarts, minimizing his issues and making it hard to relate to him. Don't get me wrong, there is still good here, but just so much wrong.
Let's go now to the specifics:

BIG SPOILERS ahead:

Good Points:
1. I actually liked seeing this more gentle and affectionate Ron. People might compare him to the movie version, but I think this is in line with what a more grown-up Ron would be like (although maybe a bit more hot-tempered). I think surviving the war, marrying the love of his life, having children, losing Fred, and having overcome his most of his insecurities would mellow him out.
2. Hermione and Ron together. Even in the alternate realities where they weren't always ""together,"" they still loved each other. They're meant to be.
3. Scorpius- how can you not like him? The most likeable character in the play. He has the intelligence/geekiness of Hermione, the positivity of Luna, and the heart of Neville. What's not to like?
4. Scorpius and Rose. Their relationship served as another way to bring together the most opposing houses in Hogwarts. And knowing that Draco had a thing for Hermione makes it better because it's the realization of what could never be, in a positive way.

Negative Points:
1. The dialogue was simplistic, robbing the characters of life and personality, and yet somehow, still making them seem out of character. What happened to the clever Hermione? The feisty and strong-headed Ginny? The calm and wise Dumbledore? And Harry? I don't think Harry would have ever said that to Albus, nor would he have  acted like a total jerk and dictator and prevented him from seeing Scorpius.
2. The ""issue"" between Albus and Harry. I could have really understood how being Harry's son could be a problem, unfortunately the way it played out was so poorly done it sometimes felt illogical. Maybe it's because time went by so fast or because I'm not visually seeing it played out, but I'm still scratching my head as to the real issue between them, why he was so harsh/unsympathetic to Harry or why he was so hung up on bringing Cedric back. I guess I just couldn't really connect to Albus.
3. Why do the time-turners work differently here? Remember in the book how changes from the future were already being played out in the present (past) during the Dementor attack? There were no alternate realities, no butterfly effects. This is supposed to be cannon?
4. Time-turners again. As soon as I saw the word time-turner I knew Albus would be going back in the past to try to change things, but I never thought he would try to do it so cheaply. ""Hey, let's engorgio Cedric's head so he gets humiliated and doesn't win the Triwizard cup. That will change everything."" I mean, he really couldn't think of a better plot? Speaking of poorly thought out ideas- Delphi. Why the heck wouldn't Delphi just take the time-turner from the very beginning and go to Voldemort? Why even bother with ""the kids"" and with Cedric??
5. You're telling me that good, kind, and honorable Cedric would have turned out to be a Death Eater if he hadn't won the Triwizard cup? What? What?? That is so ridiculous and eye-roll worthy.
6. What happened to the other characters? Where are George and the other Weasleys? Why is Ron running the joke shop? Why is he not an Auror? Where are the other Potter and Weasley kids? It's like they don't exist.
7. So Harry Potter, the Auror, savior of the wizarding world, Head of Magical Law Enforcement is now a weenie and can't even take on an 18 year old witch. Yeah, that's right. Are your eyes rolling too?
8. The worst and most unbelievable, incongruous portion of all. Voldemort has a freaking daughter!!?? Are you kidding me?! There is NO way. The only time I can picture Voldemort being remotely interested in pleasure of the body is when he was still young  with a complete soul. After that, I don't think he was even capable of wanting it, especially having no love. Plus, I don't believe he would ever risk producing an heir; and heir would be competition. A child would weaken him, ""take"" from his being, likely his power. Somebody who could usurp him- a threat. I could sooner seen him making out with Nagini. Add on top of this that, Bellatrix would have been very pregnant around the time that the trio were taken prisoners to the Malfoy Mansion, so it's just a bunch of bologna.

That being said, I realize that this is supposed to be a play and as such I am missing much of the non-verbal communication, acting, and emotion that goes behind it, but it's only a partial excuse. Macbeth was a play... so was the Crucible. That should say enough. I was torn between a 2 and 3 star, but I realized that in all honesty, had this not been ""Harry Potter,"" it would never be a three star. With Jo being so meticulous, I can't understand how she approved this. Not the concept in general, just the direction and specifics. My best advice would be watch the play first.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Before I dove into this book, I felt I had to mentally prepare myself for the different formatted storytelling of the characters I’ve loved the majority of my life. This is not a book, but a play; therefore it should have different expectations. Even with this in mind, I felt the execution was less than expected. It felt like the writer didn’t know whether they were writing a play or a novel, often being excessively descriptive in the stage directions or using unnecessary details, such as the specific number a character dialed in the telephone booth entrance to the Ministry of Magic. An audience member is not going to be able to see what number is being dialed. It was a little confusing to keep going back and forth between mindsets – is this a script or a novel?

First, let me give you a quick overview of the plot in non-spoilery fashion. Harry and Ginny’s son, Albus, and Draco’s son, Scorpius, become friends over their societal outcast—Albus’s being self-inflicted because of his apparent hatred of his relation to his father, and Scorpius because of persistent rumors that his father and mother used a special Time Turner to go back in time, resulting in Scorpius being Voldemort’s heir. For some reason, Albus becomes obsessed with Cedric Diggory’s death, and ropes Scorpius into running away from school in order to find this alleged special Time Turner, go back in time to save Cedric, and alter time, as well as Harry’s fame. They are encouraged and accompanied by Cedric’s cousin, Delphi.

The script starts off where the 7th book ended, the next generation of Potter’s, Wesley’s, and Malfoy’s boarding the Hogwarts train. However, we barely get to see Hogwarts, which was a surprise to me. For the first 20-ish% of the book, the new characters are being introduced in quick glimpses, flashing through years at a neck breaking speed without giving much of an in depth look at characters’ lives. This whole beginning was just a fast paced view of Albus getting moodier and more self-centered over the course of four years. When the pacing does slow down, we are then thrown back and forth in time without a moment to breathe. It was hard to get connected. On top of that, the dialogue is not natural and often awkward. I cringed several times when characters spoke to each other, particularly when Albus and Scorpius interact with the trolley lady on the train to Hogwarts. You know, the one that comes around and sells sweets? Apparently she is nuts. I would like to scrub that scene from my cranium.

My biggest complaint was the lack of depth to the characters. I’m not just talking about the fast forward introduction to the new ones, but also the characters that are iconic to the Harry Potter industry. Ginny’s character was completely flat and uninteresting (Flashback to the movies?), Ron is constantly trying to make awkward jokes and works at the Joke Shop now (What happened to George? I thought Ron was an Auror?), and Hermione’s intelligence isn’t anything special. Draco’s character was the only that seemed relatively close to what we would expect, and he brought some of those nostalgic feelings back. Three cheers for Draco! Oh, and of course we have a Dumbledore cameo. He appears through various picture frames as a painting in two scenes. I feel that his addition is completely unnecessary; his scenes could be cut out of the play completely and make no difference. The first scene in which he makes an appearance, he offers Harry advice that is promptly ignored, instead causing Harry to respond in the opposite direction. In the second, Dumbledore’s lines are extremely uncharacteristic and he proceeds to make an awkward and emotional apology to Harry for the way he’s treated him over the years. It feels that Dumbledore’s role was specifically to give fans some closure they felt they deserved, though uncharacteristic. This is completely unnecessary because we often don’t get closure in our real lives.

Hands down, beyond a doubt, Scorpius is by far the best character. His wit cuts through the awkward dialogue and brings humor to the angsty characters. He responds to situations with normal emotions and questions that one would expect. He is loyal, even when his best friend is caught up in his get-back-at-his-dad-for-being-famous schemes. He kept me going. *fist pump for the witty, strange Scorpius*

Some of the scenes were inconsistent with things readers know to be true of the Wizarding World. On many occasions, characters would come and go from Hogwarts grounds without any dancing around security spells. Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Draco all come through Professor McGonagall’s chimney by Flu Powder and nothing is said about it other than Professor McGonagall’s complaint about the carpet getting dirty. Is anyone allowed to come onto school grounds now? Did security become lax after the Battle of Hogwarts? Isn’t this a little overzealous? One of the first things the new trio does in their vengeance scheme is use Polyjuice Potion to transform into Ministry of Magic employees AKA the parents. Did the author(s) forget that Polyjuice Potion takes a month to make? There is no way they could’ve whipped it up so fast! Apparently all Wizarding World rules are out the window though, since Time Turners play such a huge role in the story, even though they were all destroyed in the Battle of Ministries in the 5th book. However, these are special Time Turners that break all the rules because they are able to go back years instead of being limited to an hour or so. Who would’ve thought? To top it off, during one of their leaps through time in attempt to save Cedric, the three appear in the maze portion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Somehow they are able to navigate the twists and enchantments of the maze, while remaining completely unseen by the scorekeepers, announcer, and crowds. There are a lot of things that don’t quite connect throughout.

The suspension of belief required during this read is exceptional and the dialogue cringe-worthy. The most redeeming quality of The Cursed Child is the humor Scorpius and Draco bring to the table. If you are hoping to reconnect with the story and the familiar characters, you may be left wanting more.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

First, let's be clear: this is a script, not a book. I've read play scripts before so I wasn't too worried about the format, but for some reason this seemed pretty jumpy.

I think a lot of my issues come with the writing. I felt the characters that we potter-heads knew and loved were somehow changed into characters we'd never met before. I realize that this story focuses less on our beloved characters and more on their offspring. Unfortunately, even these new characters seemed one dimensional and undeveloped.

The plot was... Meh, somewhat predictable.

Overall I was just disappointed. If anything, this makes me want to re-read the actual series again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

M. Ettinger","No New Tale to Tell","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2016","First off - if you plan on reading the 'new' Harry Potter book, you might want to skip this review. I will give no spoilers, but I will take no prisoners either.

Secondly - I get that this was written as a play, and not a novel. I try to distinguish between the two. But when you've got a series of seven novels behind you, it's hard not to take some of that into this new territory.

I purchased the book the first weekend it came out, but hung on to it until vacation, that I would read it while lounging around. As it turns out, it is a quick read: maybe five hours over a 24 hour period. It took more energy to lug the book (yes, a physical book) to the beach than it did to read it cover to cover.

While J.K. Rowling has top billing, I'd suspect (or would like to) that this is because Potter is her creation. Her writing or storytelling has never been this weak. So I also suspect that the damage is mostly done by ""co-authors"" John Tiffany and Jack Thorne.

There was potential with 'the Cursed Child', they just never ran with it. The authors found it more important to use past references - and dialogue - as exposition for those who might come to see the play who have never read, seen or heard of Harry Potter. It's frightfully annoying.

Taking place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, it basically picks up at the end of 'the Deathly Hallows'....right at the train station. I won't go into details, but most of the major players show back up - even in and after death. Apparently, the authors were not confident enough in their storytelling - or their audience - to craft a tale without resorting to popular constricts. I suppose maybe the box office would be stronger with that familiarity, but the idea is weaker.

Had the three authors developed the would-be story, 'the Cursed Child' would have been a great companion piece to the Harry Potter series. But they didn't.

Again, no spoilers: two of the main characters are the sons of Harry and Draco Malfoy. But Scorpius (yes, I know....but we have to live with that name), isn't Hermione when it comes to being a stellar student, yet he has this knowledge of Hogwarts, history and Harry down to the minutiae. And he pulls out the slightest detail at times of great duress. Again, this is all to recall aspects from most of the previous seven texts. It's allegedly to bring context to the current story, but it's just to back-fill their non-story.

And what 13 year old kid says he wants to ""seduce"" a girl. I found it profoundly creepy. It's a toss-away line almost, but yet here it is....sticking with me.

Even with the ""new"" story, most of it has been done before. But since they borrow so heavily from the others, the new part seems highly diminished.

'The Cursed Child' is not a fitting companion piece. It's a money-grab. Plain and simple.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I feel like this is the only HP book I absolutely hate. And I am JKRs biggest fan. My name is Joanna. Hers is Joanne. I am honored to be  named something close to her name. But no, thats not the point. I have read this series, and I am not lying, I swear, at least 100 times. I loved all the books, and I am 10 years young. They were such great books and all of them had lessons, couraged, learning how to love, and bad things too. But on like, the end of Feb 2016 I was jumping around and saying mom mom!!!! Can I have the 8th book please!! And IT was my bday so she was like, ok sure. Squee!!! Ok. So when July 2016 came, I was like the book came yaas! And I read it. A few times. ANd I was like ughhh, nope, why did they change? It was like they completely changed the characters to th opposite of what they were. All the good things. All gone. Ron was just a jokester man, asking for marriage when he was drunk. uh-huh. What? Mr. Weasley, you weren't like that. Hemione, she did not have any brains, no ideas, the only part I saw her through was that she hid the timeturner in books. We knew she likes books, but what else is she good at, come on all them authors arent working it out. Harry is acting soo cold and.mean. He wasn't like that,no! I thought he was a brave strong man. But now, no.Hmph.
 And I need all of the HP readers who are just starting now to start from HP1 because this book might destroy their chance to love and become a HP FAN.

As with so many authors, she is now taking substandard work and putting her name and the branding to it. As with so many other authors who pull this, this book is a mediocre shadow of her own work. It is easy to tell that it was written ""based on her work"" and not by her work. I feel a bit cheated by the quality, it didn't live up the hype.

I was excited to buy the play and read it quickly overnight on my kindle app. Instead of being struck by wonder and possibilities of the wizarding world, I keep thinking of all of the plot and character problems. If you are a mild fan who only enjoyed a few of the movies and remembers little detail of the wizarding world, you may enjoy this book. If you really loved all of the books, you are likely to be struck by the same problems I am.

**Spoilers**

The idea of Voldemort having a child by Bellatrix is absurd. Bellatrix was never pregnant. She is active as a death eater as soon as she breaks out of Azkaban. She never appeared pregnant. Voldemort was barely human by the time he returned to bodily form. He likely could not have reproduced if he wanted to. More to the point, he was not emotionally connected to anyone. His only lust was for power. He used people as tools with no attachment. Having a child would have no appeal to him. He wanted immortality. He was focused on defeating Harry Potter to accomplish that. Physical relationships would be a waste of time when he was searching for a way to solve the problem of the twin cores.

I did smile to hear Snape diss the old crew again. I loved Scorpious. But the established characters were not true to themselves. Teddy Lupin didn't even appear in the train scene. Like many Harry Potter fans, I don't consider this cannon as it is impossible to do so.

I refuse to insult J. K. Rowling. She created the wizarding world we love. I am thankful for such a detailed world that enables us to have this discussion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

I thought I’d never get my copy! Ya’ll know I’m a mega Harry Potter fan, so of COURSE I had to read it.

There have been a lot of mixed reviews from the fandom. Many think it feels like fanfiction, but the overall consensus was that it was good, even if it wasn’t the story we had hoped for. (HELLO–MAURAUDERS!) Either way, I knew I would have strong feelings.

But…I…um…HUH??

The only real feeling I have is confusion. And disappointment?

I know what this play was trying to do. It tries to bring the wonderful wizarding world to the stage. IT isn’t a novel, and so characterization and staging is limited. It can’t be the same expansive THING that are the first seven books.

However–this almost did too much in the other direction. So much of the magic of this world is Hogwarts itself–the castle, the feasts, the sortings, the Quidditch. The play had almost none of that. In fact, we hardly spend any time at all at the school; Ravenclaw isn’t even mentioned, and Hufflepuff gets one very quiet nod.

Instead, the play focuses on yet another wizarding war, and Albus becomes just one more Potter clone–and he was supposed to be the one set apart. The time turning plot gets confusing, jumping back and back and back. Maybe it comes across better on stage, but I really just miss the rest of Hogwarts.

I can see why people see this as inauthentic. It feels like it’s trying to hard–and maybe it is. I don’t think I’ve talked to a single Harry Potter fan that actually likes the epilogue, and to build a play upon it just makes it that much more uncomfortable.

I had a feeling that this is how I would feel, when I was reading the previews for the show. There was no doubt I would buy it for my collection, and read it right away. I hoped that I would be as in love with it as the rest of the books–but this will probably grow dusty on my shelf, and never get as worn as the other seven.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"

Scorpius was the only decent character in my opinion.  He was well-written and felt like more of a hero in the book than Albus did.  Everyone else was either wildly out of character (Snape cracking jokes?!  Voldemort has a daughter?!  Get out of here with that) or just flat-out annoying.  I've heard it's more entertaining to watch on the stage, but that's very likely only because in theater the focus tends to be more on the theatrics first.  Yes, it's written in play format, but it's not really distracting and provides an easy read.  Hackneyed events, characters wildly incongruent with their book and movie versions, and ridiculous plot devices really, really do make this feel like a horrible fanfiction, or at least an encyclopedia of all the worst tropes one tends to find in them.  Read if you're a hardcore Potter fan (you know you'll always wonder anyway if you don't), but be prepared for disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Cursed-Child-Playscript-ebook/product-reviews/B073P9348D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=two_star&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent"
